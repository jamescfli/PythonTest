Star Wars: Episode 1:The Phantom Menace

TITLE CARD : A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....

A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title, followed by
a roll up, which crawls up into infinity.

EPISODE 1 THE PHANTOM MENACE

Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to
outlaying star systems is in dispute.
Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the
greedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of
Naboo.
While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of
events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights,
the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the
conflict.....

PAN DOWN to reveal a small space cruiser heading TOWARD CAMERA at great
speed. PAN with the cruiser as it heads towardthe beautiful green planet of
Naboo, which is surrounded by hundreds of Trade Federation battleships.

INT. REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT


In the cockpit of the cruise, the CAPTAIN and PILOT maneuver closer to one
of the battleships.

QUI-GON : (off screen voice) Captain.

The Captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her.

CAPTAIN : Yes, sir?
QUI-GON : (V.O) Tell them we wish to board at once.
CAPTAIN : Yes, sir.

The CAPTAIN looks to her view screen, where NUTE GUNRAY, a Neimoidian trade
viceroy, waits for a reply.

CAPTAIN : (cont'd) With all due respect for the Trade Federation, the
Ambassodors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately.
NUTE : Yes, yes, of coarse...ahhh...as you know, our blockade is perfectly
legal, and we'd be happy to recieve the Ambassador...Happy to.

The screen goes black. Out the cockpit window, the sinister battleship
looms ever closer.

EXT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE (FX)

The small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of the Federation
battleship.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE

A PROTOCOL DROID, TC-14, waits at the door to the docking bay. Two WORKER
DROIDS, PK-4 and EG-9 watch.

PK-4 : They must be important if the Viceroy sent one of those useless
protocol gearheads to greet them.

The door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay.
Two darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-14.

TC-14 : I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please.

They move off down the hallway.

EG-9 : A Republic cruiser! That's trouble...don't you think?
PR-4 : I'm not made to think.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

A door slides open, and the two cloaked shapes are led PAST CAMERA into the
formal conference room by TC-14.

TC-14 : I hope you honoured sirs with the most comfortable here. My master
will be with you shortly.

The droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI- GON JINN. He backs out the
door and it closes. The JEDI lower their hoods and look out a large window
at the lush green planet of Naboo. QUI-GON sixty years old, has long white
hair in a ponytail. He is tall and striking, with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is
twenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes. Several
exotic, bird-like creatures SING in a cage near the door.

OBI-WAN : I have a bad feeling about this.
QUI-GON : I don't sense anything.
OBI-WAN : It's not about the mission, Master, it's
somethging...elsewhere...elusive.
QUI-GON : Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration
here and now where it belongs.
OBI-WAN : Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...
QUI-GON : .....but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the
living Force, my young Padawan.
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master...how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with
the chancellor's demands?
QUI-GON : These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be
short.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE GUNRAY and DAULTRAY DOFINE stand, stunned, before TC-14.

NUTE : (shaken) What?!? What did you say?
TC-14 : The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I believe.
DOFINE : I knew it! They were sent to force a settlement, eh. Blind me,
we're done for!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY

A hologram of NUTE , surrounded by BATTLE DROIDS, appears in the conference
room hallway.

NUTE : They must be dead by now. Blast, what's left of them.

The hologram fades off, as a BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, cautiously opens the
door. A deadly green cloud billows from the room. BATTLE DROIDS cock their
weapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke. It is TC-14 , carrying the
tray of drinks.

TC14 : Oh, excuse me, so sorry.

The PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp just as two flashing laser swords
fly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several BATTLE DROIDS before they
can fire.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

The bridge is a cocophony of alarms. NUTE and RUNE watch OWO-1 on the
viewscreen.

OWO-1 : Not sure exactly what...

OWO-1 is suddenly cut in half in mid-sentence. RUNE gives NUTE a worried
look.

NUTE : What in blazes is going on down there?
RUNE : Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?
NUTE : Well, not exactly, but I don't...(panicked) Seal off the bridge.
RUNE : That won't be enough, sir.

The doors to the bridge SLAM shut.

NUTE : I want destroyer droids up here at once!!!
RUNE : We will not survive this.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE

QUI-GON cuts several BATTLE DROIDS in half, creating a shower of sparks and
metal parts. OBI-WAN raises his hand, sending several BATTLE DROIDS
crashing into the wall.

QUI-GON makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut through it.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

The CREW is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge door.
QUI-GON and OBI-WAN are on the view screen.

NUTE : Close the blast doors!!!

The huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a second door, then
a third. There is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut. QUI-GON tabs
the door with his sword. The screen goes black as a red spot appears in the
center of the blast door.

RUNE : ...They're still coming through!

On the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away.

NUTE : Impossible!! This is impossible!!
RUNE : Where are those destroyer droids?!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE

Ten ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at full speed. Just
before they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their
battle configuration. QUI-GON can't see them but senses their presence.

QUI-GON : Destroyer droids!
OBI-WAN : Offhand, I'd say this mission is past the negotiaion stage.

The WHEEL DROIDS, led by P-59, rush the entry area from three hallways,
blasting away with their laser guns. They stop firing and stand in a
semi-circle as the smoke clears. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON are nowhere to be
seen.

P-59 : Switch to bio...There they are!

The Jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through the
doorway that slams shut. The WHEEL DROIDS blast away at the two JEDI with
their laser swords.

OBI-WAN : They have shield generators!
QUI-GON : It's a standoff! Let's go!

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE and RUNE stand on the bridge, watching the view screen as the WHEEL
DROIDS' POV speeds to the doorway.

RUNE : We have them on the run, sir...they're no match for destroyer
droids.
TEY HOW : Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - MAIN BAY

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN appear at a large vent in a giant hanger bay. They are
careful not to be seen. Thousands of BATTLE DROIDS are loading onto landing
craft.

QUI-GON : Battle droids.
OBI-WAN : It's an invisible army.
QUI-GON : It's an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the
Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate
ships and meet down on the planet.
OBI-WAN : You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were
short.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

TEY HOW recieves a transmission.

TEY HOW : Sir, a transmission from the planet.
RUNE : It's Queen Amidala herself.
NUTE : At last we're getting results.

On the view screen, QUEEN AMIDALA appears in her throne room. Wearing her
elaborate headdress and robes, she sits, surrounded by the GOVERNING
COUNCIL and FOUR HANDMAIDENS, EIRTAE, YANE, RABE, and SACHE.

NUTE : (cont'd) Again you come before me, Your highness. The Federation is
pleased.
AMIDALA : You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say,
Viceroy...Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.

NUTE smirks at RUNE.

NUTE : I was not aware of such a failure.
AMIDALA : I have word that the Senate is finally voting on this blockade of
yours.
NUTE : I take it you know the outcome. I wonder why they bother to vote.
AMIDALA : Enough of this pretense, Viceroy! I'm aware the Chancellor's
Ambassadors are with you now, and that you have beencommanded to reach a
settlement.
NUTE : I know nothing about any Ambassadors...you must be mistaken.

AMIDALA, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully.

AMIDALA : Beware, Viceroy....the Federation is going too far this time.
NUTE : Your Highness, we would never do anything without the approval of
the Senate. You assume too much.
AMIDALA : We will see.

The QUEEN fades off, and the view screen goes black.

RUNE : She's right, the Senate will never....
NUTE : It's too late now.
RUNE : Do you think she suspects an attack?
NUTE : I don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications
down there.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM

The QUEEN, EIRTAE, SACHE and her Governor, SIO BIBBLE, stand before a
hologram of SENATOR PALPATINE, a thin, kindly man.

PALPATINE : ...How could that be true? I have assurances from the
Chancellor...his Ambassaodrs did arrive. It must be
the...get...negotiate...

The hologram of PALPATIONE sputters and fades away.

AMIDALA : Senator Palpatine?!? (turns to Panaka) What's happening?

CAPTAIN PANAKA turns to his SARGEANT

CAPT. PANAKA : Check the transmission generators...
BIBBLE : A malfunction?
CAPT. PANAKA : It could be the Federation jamming us. Your Highness.
BIBBLE : A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion.
AMIDALA : Don't jump to conclusions, Governor. The Federation would not
dare go that far.
CAPT. PANAKA : The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be
finished.
AMIDALA : We must continue to rely on negotiation.
BIBBLE : Negotiation? We've lost all communications!...and where atre the
Chancellors Ambassadors? How can we negotiate? We must prepare to defend
ourselves.
CAPT. PANAKA : This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security
volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army.
AMIDALA : I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war.

EXT. SPACE LANDING CRAFT - TWILIGHT (FX)

Six landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the planet Naboo.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - SHALLOW LAKE - TWILIGHT

Three landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover of the
perpetually gray twilight side of the planet. One by one, the Federation
warships land in the eerie swamp.
OBI-WAN's head emerges from the mud of a shallow lake. For in the
background, the activities of the invasion force can be seen in the mist.
OBI-WAN takes several deep breaths, then dissapears again under the muddy
swamp. Troop Transports (MTT's) emerge from the landing craft.

EXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP   GRASS PLAINS - TWILIGHT (FX)

The droid invasion force moves out of the swamp and onto a grassy plain.
OOM-9, in his tank, looks out over the vast ARMY marching across the
rolling hills. A small hologram of RUNE and NUTE stands on the tank.

RUNE : ...and there is no trace of the Jedi. They may have gotton onto one
of your landing craft.
OOM-9 : If they are down here, sir, we'll find them. We are moving out of
the swamp and are marching on the cities. We are meeting no resistance.
NUTE : Excellent.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - TWILIGHT

QUI-GON runs through the strange landscape, glancing back to see the
monstrous troop transports, emerging from the mist. Animals begin to run
past him in a panic.
An odd, frog-like Gungan, JAR JAR INKS, squats holding a clam he has
retrieved from the murky swamp. The shell pops open. JAR JAR's greta tongue
snaps out and grabs the clam, swallowing it in one gulp.
JAR JAR looks up and sees QUI-GON and the other creatures running like the
wind toward him. One of the huge MTT's bears down on the JEDI like a
charging locomotive. JAR JAR stands transfixed, still holding the clam
shell in one hand.

JAR JAR : Oh, noooooooooo!

JAR JAR drops the shell and grabs onto QUI-GON as he passes. The JEDI is
caught by surprise.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Hey, help me! Help me!!
QUI-GON : Let go!

The machine is about tp crush them as QUI-GON drags JAR JAR behind him.
Just as the transport is about to hit them, QUI-GON drops, and JAR JAR goes
splat into the mud with him. The transport races overhead.
QUI-GON and JAR JAR pull themselves out of the mud. They stand watching the
war machine dissapear into the mist. JAR JAR grabs QUI-GON and hugs him.

JAR JAR : Oyi, mooie-mooie! I luv yous!

The frog-like creature kisses the JEDI.

QUI-GON : Are you brainless? You almost got us killed!
JAR JAR : I spake.
QUI-GON : The ability to speak does not make you intelligent. Now get outta
here!

QUI-GON starts to move off, and JAR JAR follows.

JAR JAR : No...no! Mesa stay...Mesa yous humble servaunt.
QUI-GON : That wont be necessary.
JAR JAR : Oh boot tis! Tis demunded byda guds. Tis a live debett, tis. Mesa
culled Jaja Binkss.

In the distance, two STAPS burst out of the mist at high speed, chasing
OBI-WAN.

QUI-GON : I have no time for this now...
JAR JAR : Say what?

The two STAPS barrell down on OBI-WAN.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Oh, nooooo! Weesa ganna....

QUI-GON throws JAR JAR into the mud.

QUI-GON : Stay down!

His head pops up.

JAR JAR : ...dieeee!

The two troops fire laser bolts at OBI-WAN. QUI-GON deflects the bolts
back, and the STAPS blow up. One-two. OBI-WAN is exhausted and tries to
catch his breath.

OBI-WAN : Sorry, Master, the water fried my weapon.

OBI-WAN pulls out his burnt laser sword handle. QUI-GON inspects it, as JAR
JAR pulls himself out of the mud.

QUI-GON : You forgot to turn your power off again, didn't you?

OBI-WAN nods sheeplishly.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) It won't take long to recharge, but this is a lesson I
hope you've learned, my young Padawan.
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master.
JAR JAR : Yousa sav-ed my again, hey?
OBI-WAN : What's this?
QUI-GON : A local. Let's go, before more of those droids show up.
JAR JAR : Mure? Mure did you spake??!?

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON start to run. JAR JAR tries to keep up.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Ex-squeeze me, but da moto grande safe place would be
Otoh Gunga. Tis where I grew up...Tis safe city.

They all stop.

QUI-GON : A city! (JAR JAR nods his head) Can you take us there?
JAR JAR : Ahhh, will...on second taut...no, not willy.
QUI-GON : No??!
JAR JAR : Iss embarrissing, boot... My afrai my've bean banished. My
forgoten der Bosses would do terrible tings to my. Terrible tings if my
goen back dare.

A PULSATING SOUND is heard in the distance.

QUI-GON : You hear that?

JAR JAR shakes his head yes.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) That's the sound of a thousand terrible things heading
this way...
OBI-WAN : When they find us, they will crush us, grind us into little
pieces, then blast us into oblivion!
JAR JAR : Oh! Yousa point is well seen. Dis way! Hurry!

JAR JAR turns and runs into the swamp.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - TWILIGHT

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN and JAR JAR run into a murky lake and stop as JAR JAR
tries to catch his breath. The TRANSPORTS ARE HEARD in the distance.

QUI-GON : Much farther?
JAR JAR : Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN pull out small capsule from their utility belts that
turn into breathing masks.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) My warning yous. Gungans no liken outlaunders. Don't
expict a wern welcome.
OBI-WAN : Don't worry, this has not been our day for warm welcomes.

JAR JAR jumps, does a double somersault with a twist, and dives into the
water.
Breath masks on, QUI-GON and OBI-WAN wade in after him.

EXT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN swim behind JAR JAR, who is very much at home in the
water. Down they swim into murky depths. In the distance the glow of Otoh
Gunga, an underwater city made up of large bubbles, becomes more distinct.
They approach the strange, art nouveau habitat. JAR JAR swims magically
through one of the bubble membranes, which seals behind him. OBI-WAN and
QUI-GON follow.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE

GUNGANS in the square scatter when they see the strange JEDI. Four GUARDS
armed with long electro-poles ride two-legged KAADUS into the square. The
GUARDS, led by CAPTAIN TARPALS, point their lethal poles at the dripping
trio.

JAR JAR : Heyo-dalee, Cap'n Tarpals, Mesa back!
CAPT. TARPALS : Noah gain, Jar Jar. Yousa goen tada Bosses. Yousa in big
dudu this time.

CAPT. TARPALS gives JAR JAR a slight zap with his power pole. JAR JAR jumps
and moves off, followed by the two JEDI.

JAR JAR : How wude.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - HIGH TOWER BOARD ROOM

The Bosses' Board Room has bubble walls, with small lighted fish swimming
around outside like moving stars. A long circular judge's bench filled with
GUNGAN OFFICIALS dominates the room. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand facing BOSS
NASS, who sits on a bench higher than the others.

BOSS NASS : Yousa cannot bees hair. Dis army of mackineeks up dare tis new
weesong!
QUI-GON : That droid army is about to attack the Naboo. We must warn them.
BOSS NASS : Wesa no like da Naboo! Un dey no like uss-ens. Da Naboo tink
day so smarty den us-ens. Day tink day brains so big.
OBI-WAN : After those droids take control of the surface, they will come
here and take control of you.
BOSS NASS : No, mesa no tink so. Mesa scant talkie witda Naboo, and no
nutten talkie it outlaunders. Dos mackineeks no comen here! Dey not know of
uss-en.
OBI-WAN : You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle. What happens to noe of
you will affect the other. You must understand this.
BOSS NASS : Wesa wish no nutten in yousa tings, outlaunder, and wesa no
care-n about da Naboo.
QUI-GON : (waves his hand) Then speed us on our way.
BOSS NASS : Wesa gonna speed yousaway.
QUI-GON : We need a transport.
BOSS NASS : Wesa give yousa una bongo. Da speedest way tooda Naboo tis goen
through da core. Now go.
QUI-GON : Thank you for your help. We go in peace.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN turn to leave.

OBI-WAN : Master, whats a bongo?
QUI-GON : A transport, I hope.

The JEDI notice JAR JAR in chains to one side, waiting to hear his verdict.
QUI-GON stops. JAR JAR gives him a forlorn look.

JAR JAR : Daza setten yous up. Goen through da planet core is bad bombin!!
QUI-GON : Thank you, my friend.
JAR JAR : Ahhh...any hep hair would be hot.

JAR JAR's soulful look is counterpointed by a sheepish grin.

OBI-WAN : We are short of time, Master.
QUI-GON : We'll need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. This
Gungan my be of help.

QUI-GON walks bact to BOSS NASS.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here?
BOSS NASS : Binkss brokeen the nocombackie law. Hisen to be pune-ished.
QUI-GON : He has been a great help to us. I hope the punishment will not be
too severe.
BOSS NASS : Pounded unto death.
JAR JAR : (grimacing) Oooooh...Ouch!

OBI-WAN looks concerned. QUI-GON is thinking.

QUI-GON : We need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. I have
saved Jar Jar Binks' life. He owes me what you call a "life.debt."
BOSS NASS : Binks. Yousa havena liveplay with thisen hisen?

JAR JAR nods and joins the JEDI. QUI-GON waves his hand.

QUI-GON : Your gods demand that his life belongs to me now.
BOSS NASS : Hisen live tis yos, outlauder. Begone wit him.
JAR JAR : Count mesa outta dis! Better dead here, den deader in da
core...Yee guds, whata mesa sayin?!

EXT. NABOO CITY - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)

A strange little submarine propels itself away from the Otoh Gunga, leaving
the glow of the settlement in the distance.

INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

OBI-WAN in the co-pilots seat, JAR JAR guides the craft.

JAR JAR : Dis is nusen.
OBI-WAN : Master, why do you keep dragging these pathetic life forms along
with us?...Here, take over.
JAR JAR : Hey, ho? Where wesa goen??
QUI-GON : You're the navigator.
JAR JAR : Yo dreamen mesa hopen...,br QUI-GON : Just relax, the Force will
guide us...
JAR JAR : Ooooh, maxibig..."da Force"...Wellen, dat smells stinkowiff.

JAR JAR veers the craft to the left and turns the lights on. The coral
vistas are grand, fantastic, and wonderous.

OBI-WAN : Why were you banished, Jar Jar?
JAR JAR : Tis a long tale, buta small part wawdabe
mesa...ooooh...aaaa.....clumsy.
OBI-WAN : They banished you because you're clumsy?

As the little sub glides into the planet core, a large dark shape begins to
follow.

JAR JAR : Mesa cause-ed mabee one or duey lettal bitty axadentes...yud-say
boom da gasser, un crash Der Bosses heyblibber...den banished.

Suddenly there is a loud CRASH, and the little craft lurches to one side.
QUI-GON looks around and sees a huge, lumimnous OPEE SEA KILLER has hooked
them with its long gooey tongue.

QUI-GON : Full speed ahead.

Instead of full ahead, JAR JAR jams the controls into reverse. The sub
flies into the mouth of the creature.

JAR JAR : Oooops.
OBI-WAN : Give me the controls.

OBI-WAN takes over the controls and the OPEE SEA KILLER instantly releases
the sub from its mouth.

JAR JAR : Wesa free!

As the sub zooms away they see a larger set of jaws, munching on the
hapless KILLER. The jaws belong to the incredible SANDO AQUA MONSTER. The
lights on the tiny sub begin to flicker as they cruise deeper into the
gloom.

QUI-GON : There's always a bigger fish.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

NUTE : The invasion is on schedule, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Good. I have the Senate bogged down in procedures. By the
time this incident comes up for a vote, they will have no choice but to
accept your control of the system.
NUTE : The Queen has great faith the Senate will side with her.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Queen Amidala is yound and naive. You will find controlling
her will not be difficult. You have done well, Viceroy.
NUTE : Thank you, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades away.

RUNE : You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi?
NUTE : No need to report that to him, until we have something to report.

INT. SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

Sparks are flying, and water is leaking into the cabin. The sound of the
power drive drops.

OBI-WAN : .....we're losing power.

OBI-WAN is working with the sparking wires. JAR JAR panics.

QUI-GON : Stay calm. We're not in trouble yet.
JAR JAR : What yet? Monstairs out dare! Leak'n in here, all'n sink'n, and
nooooo power! You nutsen! WHEN YOUSA TINK WESA IN TROUBLE?!!!?
OBI-WAN : Power's back.

The lights flicker on, revealing an ugly COLO CLAW FISH right in front of
them.

JAR JAR : Monstairs back!

The large COLO CLAW FISH is surprised and rears back. The sub turns around
and speeds away.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Wesa in trouble now??
QUI-GON : Relax.

QUI-GON puts his hand on JAR JAR's shoulder. JAR JAR relaxes into a coma.

OBI-WAN : You overdid it.

The COLO CLAW FISH leaps after the fleeing sub as it shoots out of the
tunnel and into the waiting jaws of the SANDO AQUA MONSTER.

OBI-WAN (cont'd) This is not good!

JAR JAR regains consciousness.
JAR JAR : Wesa dead yet?? Oie Boie!

JAR JAR's eyes bulge, and he faints again. The sub narrowly avoids the
deadly teeth of the AQUA MONSTER. The COLO CLAW FISH chasing them isn't so
lucky. It is munched in half by the larger predator. The little sub slips
away.

QUI-GON : Head for that outcropping.

EXT. THEED - MAIN ROAD INTO THEED - DAY (FX)

The long columns of the DROID ARMY move down the main road leading to
Theed, the Naboo capital.

EXT. THEED PLAZA - DAY (FX)

As the QUEEN watches helplessly from a window in the palace, a transport
carrying NUTE and RUNE lands in Theed Plaza. They exit the transport.

NUTE : Ah, victory!

INT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)

The little sub continue to propel itself toward the surface, which is
brightly lit.

JAR JAR : Wesa dude it!

EXT. THEED - ESTUARY - DAY

Paradise. Billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water. There is a LOUD
RUSH OF BUBBLES, and a small sub bobs to the surface.
The current in the estuary begins to pull the sub backward into a fast
moving river. OBI-WAN switches off the two remaining bubble canopies.
QUI-GON stands up to look around. JAR JAR lets out a sigh of relief.

JAR JAR : Wesa safe now.
QUI-GON : Get this thing started.
JAR JAR : Dissen berry good. Hey?
OBI-WAN : What is it?

JAR JAR looks back to where they're drifting. He sees they are headed for a
huge waterfall.

JAR JAR : What!!?? Oie boie!

OBI-WAN tries to start the engine. The long props behind the sub slowly
begin to rotate. OBI-WAN struggles until finally, a few feet short of the
waterfall, the sub starts and is able to generate enough power to stop
drifting backward in the powerful current. The sub slowly moves forward. In
the background, QUI-GON takes a cable out of his belt. The engine coughs
and dies. They start drifting backward again. JAR JAR panics.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Iyiiyi, wesa die'n here, hey!

QUI-GON shoots the thin cable, and it wraps itself around a railing on the
shore. The sub pulls the cable taut, and the little craft hangs
precariously over the edge of the waterfall.

QUI-GON : Come on...

OBI-WAN climbs out of the sub and pulls himself along the cable. QUI-GON
starts in after him.

QUI-GON : (cont'd) Come on, Jar Jar.
JAR JAR : No! Too scary!
OBI-WAN : Get up here!
JAR JAR : No a mighty no!

JAR JAR looks back and sees he is hanging over the waterfall.

JAR JAR : (cont'd) Oie boie...mesa comen. Mesa comen!

JAR JAR starts to climb out of the sub. OBI-WAN is on shore and helps to
pull QUI-GON out of the water.

OBI-WAN : That was close.
BATTLE DROID 3B3 : (O.S) Drop your weapons!

The TWO JEDI turn around to see a BATTLE DROID standing in front of them.
JAR JAR climbs up on shore between the JEDI.

BATTLE DROID 3B3 : I said drop your weapons

QUI-GON ignites his laser sword, and in a brief flash, the DROID is cut
down by the JEDI. A stray laser bolt hits the cable and the sub breaks
lose, crashing down the waterfall.
The JEDI move on. JAR JAR reluctantly follows and looks back at the mess.

JAR JAR : Whoa!!!

EXT. THEED - PALACE - DAY

The waterfalls of Theed sparkle in the noonday sun.

INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA, SIO BIBBLE, and FIVE OF HER HANDMAIDENS (EIRTAE, YANE,
PADME, RABE, SACHE) are surrounded by TWENTY DROIDS. CAPTAIN PANAKA and
FOUR NABOO GUARDS are also held at gunpoint. NUTE and RUNE stand in the
middle of the room.

BIBBLE : ...how will you explain this invasion to the Senate?
NUTE : The Naboo and the Federation will forge a treaty that will
legitimize our occupation here. I've been assured it will be ratified by
the Senate.
AMIDALA : I will not co-operate.
NUTE : Now, now, your Highness. You are not going to like what we have in
store for your people. In time, their suffering will persuade you to see
our point of view. Commander. (OOM-9 steps forward) Process them.
OOM-9 : Yes, sir! (turns to his sergeant) Take them to Camp Four.

The SERGEANT marches the GROUP out of the throne room.

EXT. PALACE - PLAZA - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTA, YANE, RABE, SACHE, CAPTAIN PANAKA, SIO
BIBBLE,
and FOUR GUARDS are led out of the palace by ten BATTLE DROIDS. The plaza
is filled with tanks and BATTLE DROIDS, which they pass on their way to the
detention camp. Unbeknownst to them, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and JAR JAR sneak
across on a walkway above the plaza and jump from a balcony to begin an
attack to rescue the QUEEN.

FOUR BATTLE DROIDS are instantly cut down. MORE DROIDS move forward and are
also cut down by the JEDIS' flashing lightsabres until there is only the
DROID SERGEANT left. The SERGEANT starts to run but is pulled back to
QUI-GON by the Force, until finally he is dispatched by the JEDI.

JAR JAR : Yousa guys bombad!

QUEEN AMIDALA and the OTHERS are amazed. JAR JAR is getting used to this.
They move between two buildings.

QUI-GON : Your Highness, we are the Ambassadors, for the Supreme
Chancellor.
BIBBLE : Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador.
QUI-GON : The negotiations never took place. Your Highness, we must make
contact with the republic.

CAPTAIN PANAKA steps forward.

CAPT. PANAKA : They've knocked out all our communications.
QUI-GON : Do you have transports?
CAPT. PANAKA : In the main hanger. This way.

THEY disappear down an alleyway as the ALARMS are sounded

INT. CENTRAL HANGER - HALLWAY - DAY

CAPTAIN PANAKA cracks open a side door to the central hanger. QUI-GON looks
in over his shoulder. OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, and the rest of the group are
behind him. They see several Naboo spacecraft guarded by about FIFTY BATTLE
DROIDS. ALARMS can be heard in the distance.

CAPT. PANAKA : There are too many of them.
QUI-GON : That won't be a problem. (to Amidala) Your Highness, under the
circumstances, Isuggest you come to Coruscant with us.
AMIDALA : Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people.
QUI-GON : They will kill you if you stay.
BIBBLE : They wouldn't dare.
CAPT. PANAKA : They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of
theirs legal. They can't afford to kill her.
QUI-GON : The situation here is not what it seems. There is something else
behind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the Federation's move
here. My feelings tell me they will destroy you.
BIBBLE : Please, Your Highness, reconsider. Our only hope is for the Senate
to side with us... Senator Palpatine will need your help.
CAPT. PANAKA : Getting past their blockade is impossible, Your Highness.
Any attempt to escape will be dangerous.
BIBBLE : Your Highness, I will stay here and do what I can...They will have
to retain the Council of Governors in order to maintain control. But you
must leave...

The QUEEN turns to PADME and EIRTAE.

AMIDALA : Either choice presents a great risk...to all of us...
PADME : We are brave, Your Highness.
QUI-GON : If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.
AMIDALA : Then, I will plead our case before the Senate. (to Bibble) Be
careful, Governor.

INT. CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

The door opens to the main hanger. QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, CAPTAIN
PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, and THREE HANDMAIDENS (PADME, EIRTAE, RABE),
followed
by QUEEN AMIDALA, head for a sleek chrome spacecraft. SIO BIBBLE, YANE and
SACHE stay behind. The HANDMAIDENS begin to cry.

CAPT. PANAKA : We need to free those pilots.

CAPTAIN PANAKA points to TWENTY GUARDS, GROUND CREW, and PILOTS held in a
corner by SIX BATTLE DROIDS.

OBI-WAN : I'll take care of that. OBI-WAN heads toward the group of
captured pilots.

QUI-GON and the QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, JAR JAR, and the rest Of the GROUP
approach the GUARDS at the ramp of the Naboo craft.

GUARD DROID : Where are you going?
QUI-GON : I'm Ambassador for the Supreme Chancellor, and I'm taking those
people to Coruscant.
DROID GUARD : You're under arrest!

The DROID GUARD draws his weapon, but before any of the DROIDS can fire,
they are cut down. OTHER GUARDS run to their aid. OBI-WAN attacks the
GUARDS around the PILOTS. QUI-GON stands, fighting off DROIDS as the OTHERS
rush on board the spacecraft. OBI-WAN, the FREED PILOTS (including RIC
OLIE), GUARDS and GROUND CREW MEMBERS rush on board the ship. The OTHER
PILOTS and GUARDS race to SIO BIBBLR. After everyone has made it onto the
ship, QUI-GONjumps on board. ALARMS sound. MORE DROIDS rush into the hanger
and fire as the ship takes off.

EXT. THEED - HANGER ENTRY - DAY (FX)

The ship exits the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS standing in the hanger shoot at
them.

EXT. SPACE (FX)

The sleek spacecraft speeds away from the planet of Naboo and heads for the
deadly Federation blockade.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

The PILOT, RIC OLIE, navigates toward the massive battleship, QUI-GON and
CAPTAIN PANAKA watch.

RIC OLIE : ....our communications are still jammed.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - DROID HOLD

JAR JAR is led into a low, cramped doorway by OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN : Now stay here, and keep out of trouble.

OBI-WAN closes the door. JAR JAR looks around and sees a long row of five
short, dome-topped ASTRO DROIDS (R-2 units). The all look alike, except for
thier paint color, and they all seem to be shut down.

JAR JAR : Ello, boyos. (no response) Disa wanna longo trip...hey?

JAR JAR taps a bright red R-2 UNIT on the head, and its head pops up a bit.
He lets out a gasp as he lifts the head.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Tis opens?...Oooops! Many springs and things come flying
out.

JAR JAR quickly closes it again, very embarrassed.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Yoi! Just yoken!
RIC OLIE : Powers back! That little droid did it. He bypassed the main
power drive. Deflector shield up, at maximum.

The lone BLUE DROID finishes his repairs and goes back into the ship. The
Naboo spacecraft races away from the Federation battleship.

RIC OLIE : There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant...the hyperdrive
is leaking.
QUI-GON : We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.

QUI-GON studies a star chart on a monitor.

OBI-WAN : Here, Master. Tatooine... It's small, out of the way, poor... The
Trade Federation has no presence there.
CAPT. PANAKA : How can you be sure?
QUI-GON : It's controlled by the Hutts...
CAPT. PANAKA : The Hutts??
OBI-WAN : It's risky...but there's no alternative.
CAPT. PANAKA : You can't take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are
gangsters... If they discovered her...
QUI-GON : ...It would be no different than if we landed on a system
controlled by the Federation...except the Hutts aren't looking for her,
which gives us an advantage.

CPATAIN PANAKA takes a deep breath in frustration.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The Naboo spacecraft races away.

INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

NUTE and RUNE sit around a conference table with a hologram of DARTH
SIDIOUS.

NUTE : We control all the cities in the North and are searching for any
other settlements...
DARTH SIDIOUS : Destroy all high-ranking officials,
Viceroy...slowly...quietly. And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty?
NUTE : She has disappeared, My Lord. One Naboo cruiser got pat the
blockade.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Viceroy, find her! I want that treaty signed.
NUTE : My Lord, it's impossible to locate the ship. It's out of our range.
DARTH SIDIOUS : ...not for a Sith...

A second SITH LORD appears behind DARTH SIDIOUS.

DARTH SIDIOUS : (Cont'd) ...Viceroy, this is my apprentice. Lord Maul. He
will find your lost ship.
NUTE : Yes, My Lord. The hologram fades off.
NUTE : (Cont'd) This is getting out of hand...now there are two of them.
RUNE : We should not have made this bargain. What will happen when the Jedi
become aware of these Sith Lords?

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and the LITTLE BLUE DROID stand before
QUEEN AMIDALA and her THREE HANDMAIDENS, PADME, EIRTAE and RABE.

CAPT. PANAKA : ...An extremely well put together little droid. Without a
doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives.
AMIDALA : It is to be commended...what is its number?

The LITTLE BLUE DROID lets out a series of bleeps.CAPTAIN PANAKA leans over
and scrapes some dirt off of the side of the DROID and read the number:

CAPT. PANAKA : R2-D2, Your Highness.
AMIDALA : Thank you, Artoo Detoo. You have proven to be very loyal...Padme!

PADME bows before the QUEEN.

AMIDALA : (Cont'd) Clean this droid up the best you can. It deserves our
gratitude...(to Panaka) Continue, Captain.

CAPTAIN PANAKA looks nervously to OBI-WAN and QUI-GON.

QUI-GON : Yor Highness, we are heading for a remote planet called Tatooine.
It is a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation. There we will
be able to make needed repairs, then travel on to Coruscant.
CAPTAIN PANAKA : Your Highness, Tatooine is very dangerous. It's controlled
by an alliance of gangs called the Hutts. I do not agree with the Jedi on
this.
QUI-GON : You must trust my judgement, Your Highness.

AMIDALA and PADME exchange looks. PADME moves next to the DROID.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

PADME sits in the Main Area, cleaning R2-D2, the brave little Astra Droid.
JAR JAR pops out of an open door.

JAR JAR : Hidoe!

Both PADME and ARTOO jump and let out a little SCREAM. The Gungan is
embarrassed that he frightened them.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Sorry, nomeanen to scare yousa.
PADME : That's all right.
JAR JAR : I scovered oily back dare. Needen it?
PADME : Thank you. This little guy is quite a mess.

JAR JAR hands PADME the oil can.

JAR JAR : Mesa Ja Ja Binksss... PADME : I'm Padme, I attend Her Highness,
You're a Gungan, aren't you? (Jar Jar nods) How did you end up here with
us?
JAR JAR : Me no know...mesa day starten pitty okeyday witda brisky morning

ARTOO BEEPS a sympathetic beep.

INT. ANBOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and CAPTAIN PANAKA watch over RIC OLIE'S shoulder. A
large yellow planet appears directly ahead. RIC OLIE searches his scopes.

OBI-WAN : Tahyt's it. Tatooine.
RIC OLIE : There's a settlement...a spaceport, looks like.
QUI-GON : Land near the outskirts. We don't want to attract any attention.

EXT. TATOOINE - SPACE (FX)

The ship heads toward the planet of Tatooine.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY (FX)

The Naboo spacecraft lands in the desert in a swirl of dust. The spaceport
of Mos Espa is seen in the distance.

EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

OBI-WAN is hoisting the hyperdrive out of a floor panel. JAR JAR rushes up
to him and falls to his knees.

JAR JAR : Obi-Wan, sire, pleeese, no mesa go!
OBI-WAN : Sorry, Qui-Gon's right. You'll make things less obvious.

JAR JAR walks back to ARTOO in the hallway as QUI-GON (dressed as a farmer)
enters the main area.

OBI-WAN : (Cant'd) The Hyperdrive generator is gone. We will need a new
one.

QUI-GON moves closer to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly to him.

QUI-GON : Don't let them send ant transmissions. Be wary...I sense a
disturbance in the Force.
OBI-WAN : I fell it also, Master.

QUI-GON goes into the hallway to meet up with ARTOO and JAR JAR. They head
to the exit ramp.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY

They start their trek across the desert toward the city of Mos Espa. In the
distance, a strange looking caravan makes its way toward the spaceport.

JAR JAR : Dis sun doen murder tada skin.

From the spaceship, CAPTAIN PANAKA and PADME run toward them.

CAPT. PANAKA : Wait!

QUI-GON stops as they catch up. PADME is dresses in rough peasant's garb.

CAPT. PANAKA : (Cont'd) Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden
with you. She wishes for her to observe the local...
QUI-GON : No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain. This spaceport
is not going to be pleasant...
CAPT. PANAKA : The Queen wishes it. She is curious about this planet.
PADME : I've been trained in defense... I can take care of myself.
CAPT. PANAKA : Don't make me go back and tell her you refuse.
QUI-GON : I don't have time to argue. But this is not a good idea. Stay
close to me.

He gives PADME a stern look.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY

The little GROUP walks down the main street of Mos Espa. They pass
dangerous looking citizens of all types. PADME looks around in awe at this
exotic enviroment.

QUI-GON : ...moisture farms for the most part, but also a few indigenous
tribes and scavengers. The few spaceports like this one are havens for
those who do not wish to be found...
PADME : ....like us. JAR JAR is in a constant state of panic.

ARTOO whistles along, with perfect confidence.

JAR JAR : Dissen berry berry bad. (steps in ooze)
Ooooh...icky...icky...goo.

EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY

The GROUP comes to a little plaza surrounded by several junk spaceship
dealers.

QUI-GON : We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

They head for a little junk shop that has a huge pile of broken spaceships
stacked up behind it.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

QUI-GON, JAR JAR, PADME, and ARTOO enter the dingy junk shop and are
greeted by WATTO, a pudgy blue alien who flies on short little wings like a
hummingbird.

WATTO : (subtitled) Hi chuba da naga? (What do you want?)
QUI-GON : I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.
WATTO : Ah yes, ah yes. Nubian. We have lots of that. What kinda junk?
(subtitled) Peedenkel! Naba dee unko (Boy, get in here! Now!)
QUI-GON : My droid here has a readout of what I need.

A disheveled boy, ANAKIN SKYWALKER, runs in from the junk yard. He is about
nine years old, very dirty, and dressed in rags. WATTO raises a hand, and
ANAKIN flinches.

WATTO : (subtitled) Coona tee-tocky malia? (What took you so long?)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Mel tassa cho-passa... (I was cleaning the bin like
you...)
WATTO : (subtitled) Chut-Chut! Ganda doe wallya. (Never mind! Watch the
store) Me dwana no bata. (I've got some selling to do here.) (to Gui-Gon)
Soooo, let me take- a thee out back. Ni you'll find what you need.

ARTOO and QUI-GON follow WATTO toward the junk yard, leaving JAR JAR with
PADME and the young boy ANAKIN. JAR JAR picks up a gizmo, trying to figure
out its purpose. QUI-GON takes the part out of his hand and puts it back.

QUI-GON : Don't touch anything.

JAR JAR makes a rude face to QUI-GON's back and sticks out his long tongue.
ANAKIN sits on the counter, pretending to clean a part, staring at PADME.
She is the most beautiful creaure he has ever seen in his life. PADME is a
little embarrassed by his stare, but she musters up an amused smile.
Finally, he gets the courage to speak.

ANAKIN : Are you an angel?
PADME : What?
ANAKIN : An angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They
live on the Moons of Iego I thimk. They are the most beautiful creatures in
the universe. They are good and kind, and so pretty they make even the most
hardened spice pirate cry.

PADME looks at him, not knowing what to say. PADME : I've never heard of
angels.

ANAKIN : You must be one...maybe you just don't know it.
PADME : You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much?
ANAKIN : Since I was very little, three, I think. My Mom and I were sold to
Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us, betting on the Podraces, to Watto,
who's a lot better master than Gardulla, I think.
PADME : You're...a slave?

ANAKIN looks at PADME defiantly.

ANAKIN : I am a person! My name is Anakin.
PADME : I'm sorry. I don't fully understand. (looking around)This is a
strange world to me.

ANAKIN studies her intently.

ANAKIN : You are a strange girl to me.

JAR JAR pushes the nose on what appears to be a LITTLE DROID, and it
instantly comes to life, grows legs and arms, and starts marching around,
knocking over everything. JAR JAR hold on but can't stop it.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Hit the nose!

JAR JAR hits the nose, and the DROID collapses back into its original
state. ANAKIN and PADME laugh. ANAKIN watches PADME straighten her hair.

EXT. WATTO'S JUNK YARD - BEHIND SHOP - DAY

WATTO reads a small portable monitor he is holding. He stands before a
hyperdrive.

WATTO : ...Here it is...a T-14 hyperdrive generator!! Thee in luck, I'm the
only one hereabouts who has one...but thee might as well buy a new ship. It
would be cheaper, I think...Sying of which, how's thee going to pay for all
this?
QUI-GON : I have 20,000 Republic dataries.
WATTO : Republic credits?!? Republic credits are no good out here. I need
something more real...
QUI-GON : I don't have anything else. (raising his hand) But credits will
do fine.
WATTO : No they won'ta. QUI-GON, using his mind power, waves his hand
again.
QUI-GON : Credits will do fine.
WATTO : No, they won'ta. What you think you're some kinda Jedi, waving your
hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don'ta work on me-only
money. No money, no parts! No deal! And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

JAR JAR pulls a part out of a stack of parts to inspect it, and they all
come tumblimg down. He struggles to catch them, only to knock more down.
ANAKIN and PADME are oblivious.

ANAKIN : ...wouldn't have lasted long if I weren't so good at fixing
things. I'm making my own droid...

QUI-GON hurries into the shop, followed by ARTOO. QUI-GON : We're leaving.
JAR JAR follows QUI-GON. PADME gives ANAKIN a loving look.

PADME : I'm glad I met you,....ah...
ANAKIN : ...Anakin.
PADME : Anakin.
ANAKIN : Anakin Skywalker.
PADME : Padme Naberrie.

PADME turns, and ANAKIN looks sad as he watches her leave.

ANAKIN : I'm glad I met you too.

WATTO enters the junk yard, shaking his head.

WATTO : (subtitled) Ootmians! Tinka me chasa hopoe ma booty na nolia.
(Outlanders! They think because we live so far from the center, we don't
know nothing.)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) La lova num botaffa. (They seemed nice to me.) WATTO :
(subtitled) Fweepa niaga. Tolpa da bunky dunko. (Clean the racks, then you
can go home.)

ANAKIN lets out a "yipee" and runs out the back.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - ALCOVE - DAY

QUI-GON, ARTOO, JAR JAR, and PADME have found a quiet spot between two
buildings. The busy street beyond is filled with dangerous looking
creatures. QUI-GON is talking on his com-link, while JAR JAR nervously
watches the street. OBI-WAN is in the main hold of the Naboo craft.

QUI-GON : ...Obi-Wan, you're sure there isn't anything of value left on
board?
OBI-WAN : (V.O) A few containers of supplies, the Queen's wardrobe, maybe.
Not enough for you to barter with. Not in the ammounts you're talking
about.
QUI-GON : All right. Another solution will present itself. I'll check back.

QUI-GON puts his comlink away and starts out into the main street. JAR JAR
grabs his arm.

JAR JAR : Noah gain...da beings hereabouts cawazy. Wesa be robbed un
crunched.
QUI-GON : Not likely. We have nothing of value, that's our problem.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - MARKET - DAY

QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR, and ARTOO move out into the street. JAR JAR is
walking behind the others. They walk by an outdoor cafe filled with a rough
gang of aliens, one of which is especially ugly, SEBULBA, a spider-like
creature. JAR JAR stops for a moment in front of a stall selling dead frogs
hanging on a wire. He looks around to see if anyone is looknig, then sticks
out his tongue, and gets hold of one, pulling it into his mouth.
Unfortunately, the frog is tied tightly to the wire. The vendor suddenly
appears.

VENDOR : Hey, that will be seven truguts!!

JAR JAR opens his mouth in surprise, and the frog snaps away, ricochets
around the market, and lands in Sebulba's soup, splashing him. As JAR JAR
moves away from the VENDOR, SEBULBA jumps up on the table and grabs the
hapless Gungan.

SEBULBA : (subtitled) Chuba!! (You!!) JAR JAR : Who, mesa?? SEBULBA :
(subtitled) Ni chuba na?? (Is this yours??)

SEBULBA holds the frog up to the Gungan threateningly. SEVERAL OTHER
CREATURES start to gather. SEBULBA shoves JAR JAR to the ground. The Gungan
desperately tries to scramble to safety.

JAR JAR : (to himself) Why mesa always da one??
ANAKIN : (V.O) Because you're afraid.

JAR JAR turns to see ANAKNI pushing his way next to him. The boy stands up
to SEBULBA in a very self-assured way.

ANAKIN : (subtitled) Chess ko, Sebulba...Coo wolpa tooney rana. (Careful,
Sebulba...This one's very connected.)

SEBULBA stops his assault on JAR JAR and turns to ANAKIN.

SEBULBA : (subtitled) Tooney rana nu pratta dunko, shag. (Connected?? Whada
you mean, slave?)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Oh da Hutt...cha porko ootman geesa...me teesa rodda
co pana pee choppa chawa. (As in Hutt...big time outlander, this one... I'd
hate to see you diced before we race again.)
SEBULBA : (subtitled) Neek me chowa, wermo, mo killee ma klounkee(Next time
we race, wermo, it will be the end of you!) Una noto wo shag, me wompity du
pom pom. (If you weren't a slave, I'd squash you right now.)

SEBULBA turns away.

ANAKIN : (subtitled) Eh, chee bana do mullee ra. (Yeah, it'd be a pity if
you had to pay for me.)

QUI-GON, PADME and ARTOO arrive.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Hi! Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange
goo. He picked a fight with a Dug. An especially dangerous Dug called
Sebulba.
JAR JAR : Nosir, nosir. Mesa hate crunchen. Dat's da last ting mesa wanten.
QUI-GON : Nevertheless, the boy is right...you were heading for trouble.
Thank you, my young friend.

PADME looks at ANAKINB and smiles; he smiles back. They start walking down
the crowded street.

JAR JAR : Mesa doen nutten!
ANAKIN : Fear attracts the fearful. He was trying to overcome his fear by
squashing you...be less afraid.
PADME : And that works for you.
ANAKIN : To a point. (he smiles)

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY

OBI-WAN stands in front of the Naboo spacecraft as the wind picks up and
begins to whip at his robe. CAPTAIN PANAKA exits the ship and joins him.

OBI-WAN : This storm's going to slow them down.
CAPT. PANAKA : It looks pretty bad. We'd better seal the ship.

CAPTAIN PANAKA'S comlink sounds off.

CAPT. PANAKA : (Cont'd) Yes? CAPT. PANAKA : We'll be right there.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - FRUIT STAND - DAY

ANAKIN and the GROUP stop at a fruit stand run by a jolly, but very poor,
old lady named JIRA.

ANAKIN : How are you feeling today, Jira?
JIRA : The heat's never been kind to me, you know, Annie!
ANAKIN : Guess what? I've found that cooling unit I've been searching for.
It's pretty beat up, but I'll have it fixed up for you in no time, I
promise.
JIRA : You're a fine boy, Annie.
ANAKIN : I'll take four pallies today. (to Padme) You'll like these...

ANAKIN reaches in his pocket and comes up with three coins. He drops one.
QUI-GON picks it up, revealing for a moment, his lightsabre.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Whoops, I thought I had more...Make thgat three, I'm not
hungry.

The wind picks up. SHOP OWNERS are starting to close up their shops as JIRA
gives them their pallies.

JIRA : Gracious, my bones are aching...storm's coming on, Annie. You'd
better get home quick.
ANAKIN : (to QUI-GON) Do you have shelter?
QUI-GON : We'll hed back to our ship.
ANAKIN : Is it far?
PADME : On the outskirts.
ANAKIN : You'll never reach the outskirts in time...sandstorms are very,
very dangerous. Come with me. Hurry!

The GROUP follows ANAKIN as he rushes down the windy street.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - STREET - SANDSTORM - DAY

The wind is blowing hard as QUI-GON, JAR JAR, and PADME follow ANAKIN down
the street and into a slave hovel.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON, JAR JAR, ARTOO, and PADME enter a small living space.

ANAKIN : Mom! Mom! I'm home.
JAR JAR : Dissen cozy.

Anakin's mother, SHMI SKYWALKER, a warm, friendly woman of forty, enters
from her work area and is startled to see the room full of people.

SHMI : Oh, my!! Annie, what's this?
ANAKIN : These are my friends, Mom. This is Padme, and...gee, I don't know
any of your names.
QUI-GON : I'm Qui-Gon Jinn, and this is Jar Jar Binks. ARTOO lets out a
little beep.
PADME : ...and our droid, Artoo-Detoo.
ANAKIN : I'm building a droid. You wanna see?
SHMI : Anakin! Why are they here?
ANAKIN : A sandstorm, Mom. Listen.

The wind HOWLS outside.

QUI-GON : Your son was kind enough to offer us shelter.
ANAKIN : Come on! Let me show you Threepio!

ANAKIN leads PADME into the other room. ARTOO follows, beeping all the way.
QUI-GON takes five small capsules from his utility belt and hands them to
SHMI.

QUI-GON : I have enough food for a meal.
SHMI : Oh, tank you. Thank you so much. I'm sorry if I was abrupt. I'll
never get used to Anakin's surprises.
QUI-GON : He's a very special boy. SHMI looks at him as if he's discovered
a secret.
SHMI : Yes, I know.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - BEDROOM - DAY

ANAKIN shows off his ANDROID, which is lying on his workbench. There is one
eye in the head; the body, arms, and legs have no outer coverings.

ANAKIN : Isn't he great?! He's not finished yet.
PADME : He's wonderful!
ANAKIN : You reall like him? He's a protocol droid...to help Mom. Watch!

ANAKIN pushes a switch, and the DROID sits up. Anakin rushes around, grabs
an eye and puts it in one of the sockets.

THREEPIO : How do you do, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How
might I serve you?
PADME : He's perfect.
ANAKIN : When the storm is over, you can see my racer. I'm building a
Podracer!

PADME smiles at his enthusiasm. ARTOO lets out a flurry of beeps and
whistles.

THREEPIO : I beg your pardon....what do you mean I'm naked?

ARTOO BEEPS

THREEPIO : (Cont'd) My parts are showing? Oh, my goodness. How
embarrassing!

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS

AMIDALA, EIRTAE, RABE, and OBI-WAN watch a very bad transmission of a SIO
BIBBLE hologram.

BIBBLE : ...cut off all food supplies until you return...the death toll is
catastrophic...we must bow to their wishes, Your Highness...Please tell us
what to do! If you can hear us, Your Highness, you must contact me...

AMIDALA looks upset...almost nervous.

OBI-WAN : It's a trick. Send no reply... Send no transmission of any kind.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON listens to his comlink. OBI-WAN is in the cockpit.

OBI-WAN : ...the Queen is upset...but absolutly no reply was sent.
QUI-GON : It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace.
OBI-WAN : What if it is true and the people are dying?
QUI-GON : Either way, we're running out of time.

EXT. CORUSCANT - BALCONY OVERLOOKING CITY - NIGHT

DARTH SIDIOUS and DARTH MAUL look out over the vast city.

DARTH MAUL : Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I
will find them quickly, Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Move against the Jedi first...you will then have no
difficulty taking the Queen back to Naboo, where she will sign the treaty.
DARTH MAUL : At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will
have revenge.
DARTH SIDIOUS : You have been well trained, my young apprentice, they will
be no match for you. It is too late for them to stop us now. Everything is
going as planned. The Republic will soon be in my command.

The hologram of DARTH MAUL fades off as DARTH SIDIOUS looks out over the
city. EXT. MOS ESPA - SANDSTORM - DAY

The giant sandstorm engulfs the town, including the Naboo spaceship on the
outskirts of the city center, where Watto's ship is; and the slave
quarters, where drifts of sand begin building up against Anakin's house.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON, ANAKIN, SHMI, JAR JAR, and PADME are seated around a makeshift
table, having dinner as the wind howls outside.
JAR JAR slurps his soup rather loudly. Everyone looks at him. He turns a
little brighter red.

SHMI : All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere.
ANAKIN : I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no
luck.
SHMI : Any attempt to escape...
ANAKIN : ...and they blow you up...poof!

PADME and JAR JAR are horrified.

JAR JAR : How wude.
PADME : I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The
Republic's anti-slavery laws...
SHMI : The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own.

An awkward silence. ANAKIN attempts to end the embarrassment.

ANAKIN : Have you ever seen a Podrace?

PADME shakes her head no. She notices the concern of SHMI. JAR JAR snatches
some food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue.
QUI-GON gives him a dirty look.

QUI-GON : They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.
ANAKIN : I'm the only human who can do it.

SHMI looks askance at her son.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's true. Watto says he's
never heard of a human doing it.
QUI-GON : You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.

ANAKIN smiles. JAR JAR attempts to snare another bit of food from the bowl
with his tongue, but QUI-GON, in a flash, grabs it between his thumb and
forefinger. JAR JAR is startled.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Don't do that again.

JAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-GON lets go of
the tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR's mouth.

ANAKIN : I...I was wondering...something...
QUI-GON : What?
ANAKIN : Well, ahhh...you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?
QUI-GON : What makes you think that?
ANAKIN : I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.

QUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.

QUI-GON : Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him.
ANAKIN : I don't think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight.
QUI-GON : I wish that were so...
ANAKIN. I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the
slaves...have you come to free us?
QUI-GON : No, I'm afraid not...
ANAKIN : I think you have...why else would you be here?

QUI-GON thinks for a moment.

QUI-GON : I can see there's no fooling you...(leans forward) You mustn't
let anyone know about us...we're on our way to Coruscant, the central
system in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept
secret.
ANAKIN : Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim?
PADME : Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair
it.
ANAKIN : I can help! I can fix anything!
QUI-GON : I believe you can, but our first job is to aquire the parts we
need...
JAR JAR : Wit no-nutten mula to trade.
PADME : These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.
SHMI : Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful
races.
QUI-GON : Podracing... Greed can be a powerful ally.. if it's used
properly.
ANAKIN : I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race
tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished...
SHMI : Anakin, settle down. Watto won't let you...
ANAKIN : Watto doesn't know I've built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him
think it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.

QUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset.

SHMI : I don't want you to race, Annie...It's awful. I die every time Watto
makes you do it.

ANAKIN : But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they're in trouble. The
prize money would more than pay for the parts they need. JAR JAR : Wesa ina
pitty bad goo.
GUI-GON : Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who
might be able to help us?

SHMI shakes her head no.

ANAKIN : We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in
the universe is no one helps each other...
SHMI : Anakin, don't...

JAR JAR belches. There is silence for a moment as they eat.

PADME : I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We will
find another way...
SHMI : No, Annie's right, there is no other way... I may not like it, but
he can help you...he was meant to help you.
ANAKIN : Is that a yes? That is a yes!

The storm continues to rage outside the slave hovel.

EXT. MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY

The storm has passed. VENDORS and STREET PEOPLE clean up the mess and
rebuild their food stalls. JAR JAR sits on a box in front of Watto's parts
shop, watching all the activity with growing nervousness. ARTOO is standing
next to him. PADME stops QUI-GON as he is about to enter the shop.

PADME : Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know.
The Queen will not approve.
QUI-GON : The Queen does not need to know.
PADME : Well, I don't approve.

QUI-GON turns and starts into the shop.

INT. WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

WATTO and ANAKIN are in the middle of an animated discussion in Huttese.

WATTO : Patta go bolla!
ANKAIN : No batta!
WATTO : Pedunky. Maa kee cheelya.
ANAKIN : Bayno, Bayno!

QUI-GON walks in, and WATTO and ANAKIN join him.

WATTO : The boy tells me you wanta sponser hi insa race. You can't afford
parts. How can you do this? Not on Republic credits, I think. (he laughs)
QUI-GON : My ship will be the entry fee.

QUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket, and
a hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of
WATTO. He studies it.

WATTO : Not bad...not bad...a Nubian.
QUI-GON : It's in good order, except for the parts we need.
WATTO : ...but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last
race. It will take some time to fix it.

ANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward.

ANAKIN : Ahhhh....it wasn't my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his
vent ports. I actually saved the Pod...mostly.
WATTO : (laughing) That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there.
QUI-GON : I have...acquired a Pod in a game of chance. "The fastest ever
built."
WATTO : I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it. (laughs) So, you
supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings
fifty-fifty, I think.
QUI-GON : Fifty-fifty!?! If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you
front the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus
the cost of the parts I need...If we lose, you keep my ship.

WATTO thinks about this. ANAKIN tries not to be nervous.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Either way, you win.
WATTO : (subtitled) Deal! Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya. (Your friend is a
follish one, methinks.)

EXT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - TATOOINE DESERT - DAY

OBI-WAN stands outside the Naboo spacecraft, speaking into his comlink.
QUI-GON is on the back porch of the hovel.

OBI-WAN : What if this plan fails, Master? We could be stuck here for a
long time.
QUI-GON : (V.O) A ship without a power supply will not get us anywhere, and
there is something about this boy...

EXT MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY

QUI-GON puts the comlink away as SHMI comes onto the porch

PADME, ANAKIN, JAR JAR, and ARTOO work on the engines of the Podracer in
the courtyard below.

QUI-GON : You should be proud of your son. He gives without any thought of
reward.
SHMI : He knows nothing of greed. He has...
QUI-GON : He has special powers.
SHMI : Yes...
QUI-GON : He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to
have such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.
SHMI : He deserves better than a slave's life.
QUI-GON : The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear. Who
was his father?
SHMI : There was no father, that I know of...I carried him, I gave him
birth...I can't explain what happened. Can you help him?
QUI-GON : I'm afraid not. Had he been born in the Republic, we would have
identified him early, and he would have become Jedi, no doubt...he has the
way. But it's too late for him now, he's too old.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - BACK YARD - DAY

KITSTER (a young boy about Anakin's age), SEEK (a boy of ten), AMEE (a girl
of six), and WALD (a Greedo Type, six years old) join ANAKIN, JAR JAR,
ARTOO, and PADME securing some wiring.

ANAKIN : Padme and Jar Jar, this is my friend Kitster, and seek, Amee, and
Wald.

All whistle, hoot, and speak a greeting.

KITSTER : Wow, a real Astro Droid...how'd you get so lucky?
ANAKIN : This isn't the half of it. I'm entered in the Boonta Race
tomorrow!
KITSTER : What? With this??
WALD : (subtitled) Annie, Jesko na joka. 9You are such a joke, Annie.)
AMEE : You've been working on that thing for years. It's never going to
run.
SEEK : Come on, let's go play ball. Keep it up, Annie, and you're gonna be
bug squash.

SEEK, WALD, and AMEE take off, laughing. JAR JAR is fiddling with one of
the energy binder plates.

ANAKIN : Hey! Jar Jar! Stay away from those energy binders...
JAR JAR : Who, mesa?
ANAKIN : If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours.

JAR JAR peeks at the energy plate; it makes a little electronic pop, zaps
him in the mouth and jumps back. JAR JAR tries to say something, but his
mouth is numb and his words are garbled.

JAR JAR : Ouch-dats muy bigo Oucho. (Gibberish)
KITSTER : But you don't even know if this thing will run.
ANAKIN : It will.

QUI-GON approaches the GROUP and gives ANAKIN a small battery. JAR JAR gets
his hand caught in the afterburner and tries to tell Anakin, but can't get
words out that make sense.

QUI-GON : I think it's time we found out. Use this power charge. ANAKIN :
Yes, sir!!

ANAKIN jumps into the little capsule behind the two giant engines. He puts
the power pack back into the dashboard. EVERYONE backs away, except for JAR
JAR who calls for help. Finally PADME frees him and the engines ignite with
a ROAR. EVERYONE cheers.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY

SHMI, watching from the porch, smiles sadly.

EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - BALCONY - NIGHT

ANAKIN sits on the balcony rail of his hovel as QUI-GON tends to a cut. The
BOY leans back to look at the vast blanket of stars in the sky.

QUI-GON : Sit still, Annie. Let me clean this cut.
ANAKIN : There are so many! Do they all have a system of planets?
QUI-GON : Most of them.
ANAKIN : Has anyone been to them all?
QU-IG0N : (laughs) Not likely.
ANAKIN : I want to be the first one to see them all... Ouch!

QUI-GON wipes a patch of blood off ANAKIN'S arm.

QUI-GON : There, good as new...

SHMI yells from inside the hovel.

SHMI : (O.S.) Annie, bedtime!

QUI-GON scrapes ANAKIN's blood onto a comlink chip.

ANAKIN : What are you doing?
QUI-GON : Checking your blood for infections.
ANAKIN : I've never seen...
SHMI : (O.S.) Annie! I'm not goiung to tell you again!
QUI-GON : Go on, you have a big day tomorrow. (beat) Goodnight.

ANAKIN rolls his eyes and runs into the hovel. QUI-GON takes the blood
stained chip and inserts it into the comlink, then calls OBI-WAN.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Obi-Wan...
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master.
QUI-GON : Make an analysis of this blood sample I'm sending you.
OBI-WAN : Wait a minute...
QUI-GON : I need a midi-chlorian count.
OBI-WAN : All right. I've got it.
QUI-GON : What are your readings?
OBI-WAN : Something must be wrong with the transmission.
QUI-GON : Here's a signal check.
OBI-WAN : Strange. The transmission seems to be in good order, but the
reading's off the chart...over twenty thousand.
QUI-GON : (almost to himself) That's it then.
OBI-WAN : Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high!
QUI-GON : No Jedi has.
OBI-WAN : What does it mean?
QUI-GON : I'm not sure.

The JEDI KNIGHT looks up and sees SHMI in the doorway watching him.
Embarrassed, she goes back into the kitchen while QUI-GON ponders the
situation.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT MESA - NIGHT

The sinister looking Sith spacecraft lands on top of a desert mesa at dus,
scattering a herd of banthas. DARTH MAUL walks to the edge of the mesa and
studies the landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars. He picks out the
lights of three different cities in the distance, then pushes buttons on
his electronic armband.

Six football-sized PROBE DROIDS float out of the ship and head off in three
different directions toward the cities.

DARTH MAUL stands on the mesa and watches them through his
electrobinoculars.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - SUNRISE

Padme exits the hovel.

EXT. MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - BACK YARD - SUNRISE

As the twin suns rise, ARTOO is busy painting the racing Pod. ANAKIN is
asleep. PADME passes ARTOO.

PADME : I hope you're about finished.

ARTOO whistles a positive reply. PADME sees KITSTER riding toward them on
an EOPIE, a strange camel-lile creature. He is leading a second EOPIE
behind him. PADME goes over to ANAKIN. He looks very vulnerable as he
sleeps. She watches him, then touches him on the cheek. ANAKIN wakes up,
yawns, and looks at her, a little puzzled.

ANAKIN : You were in my dream...you were leading a huge army into battle.
PADME : I hope not; I hate fighting. Your mother wants you to come in and
clean up. We have to leave soon. ANAKIN stands up and stretches just as
KITSTER arrives.

ANAKIN : Hook 'em up, Kitster. (to Padme) I won't be long. Where's Qui-Gon?

PADME : He and Jar Jar left already. They're with Watto at the arena.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

RACE CREWS mill about outside the Main Hanger.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

The hanger is a large building with a dozen or so Podracers being readied
for the race. ALIEN CREWS and PILOTS rush about, making last minute fixes
on their vehicles. WATTO, QUI-GON, and JAR JAR walk through the activity.

WATTO : ...I want to see your spaceship the moment the race is over.
QUI-GON : Patienc, my blue friend. You'll have your winnings before the
suns set, and we'll be far away from here.
WATTO : Not if your ship belongs to me, I think...I warn you, no funny
business.
QUI-GON : You don't think Anakin will win?

WATTO stops before an orange racer. Sitting to one side, having his
shoulders and neck massaged by TWIN YOBANAS, is SEBULBA.

WATTO : Don't get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit
to your race, but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.
QUI-GON : Why?
WATTO : He always wins. (laughs) I'm betting heavily on Sebulba.
QUI-GON : I'll take that bet.
WATTO : (suddenly stops laughing) What??!! What do you mean?
QUI-GON : I'll wager my new racing pod against...say...the boy and his
mother.
WATTO : A Pod for slaves. I don't think so...well, poerhaps. Just one...the
mother, maybe...the boy isn't for sale.
QUI-GON : The boy is small, he can't be worth much.

WATTO shakes his head.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) For the fastest Pod ever built?!

WATTO shakes his head again.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Both, or no bet.
WATTO : No Pod's worth two slaves...not by a long shot...one slave or
nothing.
QUI-GON : The boy, then...

WATTO pulls out a small cube from his pocket.

WATTO : We'll let fate decide. Blue it's the boy, red his mother...

WATTO tosses the cube down. QUI-GON lifts his hand slightly; it turns blue.
QUI-GON smiles. WATTO is angry.

WATTO : (Cont'd) You won the small toss, outlander, bou you won't win the
race, so...it makes little difference.

ANAKIN and PADME enter the hanger on one of the EOPIES, pulling an engine.
KITSTER, on the other EOPIE, is pulling another engine. With THREEPIO
walking alongside, ARTOO trundles behind, pulling the Pod with SHMI sitting
on it. WATTO passes ANAKIN as he leaves.

WATTO : (Cont'd) (subtitled) Bonapa keesa pateeso, o wanna meetee chobodd.
(Better stop your friends betting, or I'll end up owning him, too.)

WATTO walks off, laughing.

ANAKIN : What did he mean by that?

QUI-GON : I'll tell you later.

ARTOO beeps at THREEPIO.

THREEPIO : Oh my! Space travel sounds rather perilous.

ARTOO emits a series of beeps.

THREEPIO : I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those
dreadful starships!
KITSTER : (to Anakin) This is so wizard! I'm sure you'll do it this time,
Annie.
PADME : Do what?
KITSTER : Finish the race, of course!
PADME : You've never won a race?
ANAKIN : Well...not exactly...
PADME : Not even finished?!

ANAKN looks sheepish.

ANAKIN : ...but Kitster's right, I will this time.
QUI-GON : Of course you will.

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY

One of Darth Maul's PROBE DROIDS slowly floats down the main street of
Tatooine. It looks in shops and studies PEOPLE as it searches for OBI-WAN,
QI-GON, or the QUEEN.

EXT. MOS ESPA - DESERT RACE ARENA - DAY

An EXTREME HIGH WIDE ANGLE reveals a vast arena in the Tatooine desert. A
large semi-circular amphitheatre that holds at least a hundred thousand
people dominates the landscape. Large viewing platforms loom over the
racetrack. INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCER'S BOX - DAY (FX)

A two-headed ANNOUNCER describes the scene.

FODE BEED : -
A: Toogi! Toogie! (Greetings) Toong mee cha kulkah du Boonta magi! tah oos
azalus ooval Poddraces. (We have perfect weather today for the Boonta
classic. The most hazardous of all Podraces.)
B : That's absolutly right. And a big turnout here, from all corners of the
Outer Rim territories. I see the contestants are making their way out onto
the starting grid.

EXT. MOS ESPA - DESERT RACE ARENA - DAY

On the left side of the tracks across from the grandstands, a line of
Podracers emerges from the large hanger, surrounded by several CREW
MEMBERS. Pods are pulled by a wide variety of CREATURES and are led by
aliens carrying flags. The PILOTS stand facing the royal box.

FODE BEED : -
(O.S) A : La Yma beestoo (Yes, there they are!)
B : I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund system.
A : ...eh Gasgano doowa newpa Ord Petrovia! (And Gasgano in thenew Ord
Pedrovia.)
B : Two time winner, Boles Roor...
A : Poo tula moosta, woe grane champio Sebulba du Pixelito! Splastyleeya

Pixelito. By far the favorite today.)
B : And a late entry, Anakin Skywalker, a local boy.
A : Wampa peedunkee unko ( I hope he has better luck this time.)
B : I see the flaggers are moving onto the track.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - GRANDSTAND - DAY

Colorful canopies shade some of the SPECTATORS. VENDORS sell barbecued
creature parts and colorful drinks.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - ROYAL BOX - DAY (FX)

All the PILOTS bow from the waist as JABBA THE HUTT enters the box and
waves to the crowd.

FODE BEED : -
A : O grandio lust, Jabba Du Hutt, amu intoe tah parena. (His honor, our
glorious host, Jabba the Hutt has entered the arena.)

The crowd ROARS. SEVERAL OTHER SLUG-LIKE HUTTS follow, along with humans
and aliens. Several SLAVE GIRLS on a chain are led alongside JABBA.

JABBA : (subtitled) Chowbaso! Tam ka chee Boonta rulee ya, kee madda
hodrudda du wundee. (Welcome!) Sebulba tuta Pixelito...

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

SEBULBA, who is right next to ANAKIN, stands and waves to his fans. A small
pep band plays as his fans wave and cheer.

KITSTER attaches the giant engins to Anakin's Pod with a long cable. SHMI
gives ANAKIN a big hug and kiss. She looks him right in the eye.

SHMI : Be safe.
ANAKIN : I will, Mom. I promise.

She leaves as ANAKIN checks the cable hitches.

JABBA : ...Mawhonic tuta Hok, Teemto Pagalies tuta Moonus Mandel, Anakin
SKywalker tuta Tatoonine....

The CROWD YELLS. ANAKIN waves to the crowd, as JABBA continues with his
introductions. SEBULBA moves over to one of Anakin's engines. KITSTER and
JAR JAR unhitch the EOPIES, and KITSTER leads them away. ARTOO beeps that
everything is OK. JAR JAR pats ANAKIN on the back.

JAR JAR : Dis berry loony, Annie. May da guds be kind, mesa palo.

PADME comes up and gives ANAKIN a little kiss on the cheeek. SEBULBA bangs
on a part protruding from Anakin's engine. He looks around to see if anyone
has noticed.

PADME : You carry all our hopes.
ANAKIN : I won't let you down.

PADME moves away as SEBULBA edges his way next to ANAKIN and gives him a
sinister grin.

SEBULBA : Bazda wahota, shag. Dobiella Nok. Yoka to Bantha poodoo. 9You
won't walk away from this one, slave scum! You're Bantha poodoo.)
ANAKIN : (subtitled) Cha skrundee da pat, sleemo. (Don't count on it,
slime-ball.)

ANAKIN looks the evil SEBULBA in the eye with a cold stare. QUI-GON
approaches, and SEBULBA backs off toward his racer.

JABBA : (sutitled)...Ka bazza kundee hodrudda! (...Let the challenge
begin!)

The CROWD lets out a LOUD CHEER. QUI-GON helps ANAKIN into his Pod. The boy
straps himself into the tiny racer.

QUI-GON : Are you all set, Annie? (Anakin nods) Remember, concentrate on
the moment. Feel. Don't think. Trust your instincts. (he smiles) May the
Force be with you.

QUI-GON steps away as ANAKIN puts on his goggles. The PILOTS flip switches,
and powerful energy binders shoot between the engines. ANAKIN flips a
switch, and his engine starts. The incredible ROAR of high-powered engines
igniting echoes throughout the arena. One driver, ODY MANDRELL, yells at a
droid (DUM-4) to get away from the front of his engine. The crowd is tense.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

The giant power-house engines torque as the PILOTS gun them. The PILOTS
flip switches, and poerful energy binders shoot between the engines. Aliens
carrying large flags move off the track. JAR JAR covers his eyes.

JAR JAR : Mesa no watch. Dissen ganna be messy!
FODE BEED : -
A : Ya pawa culka doe rundee! (The power couplings are being activated)
B : Hey, it looks like they're clearing the grid.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

SHMI looks nervously to QUI-GON as he enters a veiwing platform. PADME and
JAR JAR are already on board. The platform rises like an elevator.

SHMI : Is he nervous?
QUI-GON : He's fine.
PADME : You Jedi are far too reckless. The Queen...
QUI-GON : The Queen trusts my judgment, young handmaiden. You should too.
PADME : You assume too much.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCER'S BOX - DAY (FX)

FODE BEED : -
B : Start your engines.

The earth-pounding ROAR of the engines revving is deafening.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - ROYAL BOX - DAY (FX)

Jabba bites off the head of a frog and spits it at a gong, signaling the
start of the race.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY

On a bridge over the track, a great green light at the center flashes. The
Podracers shoot forward with a high-pitches scream. ANAKIN'S engine floods
and coughs - then dies. All the other Podracers except one swerve around
him and dissapear down the track. The slave boy struggles to get his racer
started. The two-headed announcer reports.

FODE BEED : - (O.S.)
A : An dare ovv! (And they're off!)
B : Oh...wait. Little Skywalker has stalled.

PADME and JAR JAR are very dissapointed with ANAKIN. QUI-GON puts his arm
around a very worried SHMI to comfort her. Finally, Anakin's engines
ignite. He zooms away after the receeding pack of competitors, leaving one
quadra-Pod racer still trying to get started. The two-headed ANNOUNCER
describes the race as it progresses.

FODE BEED : - (O.S.)
B : And there goes Skywalker... He'll be hard pressed to catch up with the
leaders today.

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

The Podracers fly across the desert. SEBULBA is running neck and neck with
MAWHONIC. They round the first turn in the track, side by side. SEBULBA
drives his Pod into his rival, forcing him into the wall of a large rock
formation. MAWHONIC crashes in a spectacular display of fire and smoke.
ANAKIN is much faster than the back-end stragglers and passes them easily.
One of the drivers, GASGANO, won't let ANAKIN by. ANAKIN tries to pass him
on one side and is cut off. He then tries to pass him on the other side
ansd is cut off. As they come up on a cliff drop-off, ANAKIN backs off,
then guns it as GASGANO goes over the cliff. ANAJIN accelerates so fast
that he sails right over the top of GASGANO and speeds away.
Four TUSKEN RAIDERS perched above the race course fire their rifles at the
Pods racing in the canyon below them. One shot ricochets off the back of
Anakin's Pod.

FODE BEED : -
B : Looks like a few Tusken Riaders have campe out on the canyon dune turn.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

JABBA THE HUTT and the crowd watch the progress of the race on small,
hand-held view screens. JAR JAR is looking over the shoulder of a strange
alien named FANTA.

JAR JAR : Where's Skywalker?

FANTA moves the view screen out of Jar Jar's view. PADME, SHMI, and QUI-GON
watch another screen and look worried.
ARTOO, down in the pits with KITSTER, lets out a worried sigh. The driver
of the quadra-Pod looks worried.

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

ANAKIN is powering around corners and over hills and cliffs, passing other
racers right and left. SEBULBA is in the lead. He is being challenged by
another racer, XELBREE.
SEBULBA slows a little, and as XELBREE pulls alongside, he opens a side
vent on the racer's engine and the exhaust starts to cut through the
alien's engine.
The blast cuts along the engine until finally it EXPLODES. SEBULBA deftly
veers away.
ANAKIN works his way through a dense mass of racers as they zoom over a
dune sea, kicking up dust. His Pod shakes violently as he goes over a jump.
One of the Podracers, ODY, catches one of his engines in the sand, and the
whole thing EXPLODES.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

QUI-GON sits quietly, meditating. PADME and SHMI search the landscape for
any sign of the racers. JAR JAR is still annoying FANTA for information.
The crowd SCREAMS. WATTO is laughing with his friends, confident in
Anakin's defeat.
The quadra-Pod engines start just as the racers come around the corner. The
DRIVER, BEN QUADINAROS, puts it in gear, and the four engines go off in all
directions, EXPLODING in a spectacular display. The Pod drops to the ground
as SEBULBA enters the arena, closely followed by all the OTHER RACERS.
KITSTER strains to see as ARTOO beeps excitedly. The announcer continues.

FODE BEED : - (O.S)
B ; There goes Quadinaros' power couplings.
A : Sebulba! Ka pa me cheespa wata! (Here comes Sebulba in record time.)

QUI-GON, PADME, SHMI, and JAR JAR yell for joy as ANAKIN passes. JAR JAR is
very nervous and pounds on the back of his alien neighbor, FANTA. JAR JAR :
What gooie-on?
FANTA : Bug off.

Lap two. SEBULBA and the pack race past the main arena. The crowd stands
and YELLS as the Podracers scream off into the distance. QUI-GON and PADME
look worried.

JAR JAR : He musta crash-ud.
PADME : Here he comes!

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - PIT AREA - DAY (FX)

ARTOO lets out an excited whistle, as KITSTER yells.

THREEPIO : He has to complete two more circuits? Oh dear!

EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

Sure enough, coming around the bend is ANAKIN, quickly gaining on the pack.
The two-headed announcer describes the action. The crowd goes wild.

FODE BEED : - (O.S.)
B : It looks like Skywalker is moving up through the field. He's in...
A : Steeth pa nagoola! (Sixth place, not bad.)

ANAKIN continues to gain on the pack. Tension for SHMI and PADME is
unbearable.
ODY stops in the pits. Droids work on his engines. DUM-4 stands in front of
the engine and is sucked in, causing the engine to die. DUM-4 is spit out
the back of the engine, very bent up. The engine lets out one final wheeze,
then EXPLODES in a puff of smoke.

FODE BEED : - (O.S.)
A : Ody Mandrell! Coona wa wunda dunko! (Ody Mandrell into the pits for
some attention.)
ODY : Droids!

TERTER is getting close to SEBULBA, who purposely breaks a small part off
his Pod, sending it into Terter's engine, causing him to veer into ANAKIN,
and unhooks one of the main straps on Anakin's engines that links the Pod
to his engines.
ANAKIN struggles to keep control of the little Pod. It whips about wildly.
As the Pod swings near the broken engine strap, ANAKIN grabs for it.
Finally, he catches the strap and manages to unhook it to the Pod.
SEBULBA cuts the engine of OBITOKI with his side exhaust, and the racer
crashes with a cloud of dust. A THIRD RACER, HABBA, flie into the cloud of
dust and crashes into OBITOKI. ANAKIN rounds a corner and heads into the
cloud of smoke. He hits a part of one of the engines but regains control.

FODE BEED : - (O.S.)
B :At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba is in the lead, closely
followed by Skywalker...

ANAKIN finally catches up with SEBULBA, and runs neck and neck over the
rough terrain. JAR JAR, QUI-GON, SHMI, and PADME all SCREAM s ANAKIN comes
through the arena. The lights in the tower indicate that this is the third
and last lap. WATTO begins to worry.
SEBULBA uses his side exhaust port to try to cut through Anakin's engines.
ANAKIN manages to avoid having his engine disabled but is forced off
course.

FODE BEED : - (O.S.)
B : Skywalker is forced onto the service ramp!
A : Oh noah!

On a tight corner, ANAKIN dives to the inside and takes the lead.

FODE BEED : - (O.S.)
B : Amazing... a controlled thrust and he's back on course! What a move!

SEBULBA is furious. He stay's right on Anakin's tail, crowding him and
pushing him through the turns.
SEBULBA pushes ANAKIN harder, and the young boy has a difficult time
keeping control. One of the parts on Anakin's engines begins to shake
loose. ANAKIN sees it and switches over to an auxiliary system. While he is
trying to accomplish this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him.
ANAKIN tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move ANAKIN makes,
SEBULBA is able to block.
Finally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the inside as he usually does, then tries
to go around SEBULBA on the outside. They race sid by side down the final
stretch of the track.

FODE BEED : - (O.S.)
B : He's catching Sebulba.
A : Inkabunga. (Incredible!)

SEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes into ANAKIN
over and over. The young boy struggles to maintain control as the steering
rods on the two Pods become hooked together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.

FODE BEED : - (O.S.)
B : That little human being is out of his mind.
A : Punda tah punda! (They're neck and neck!)
B : They're side by side!
A : Bongo du bongu! (Shoulder to shoulder!)

As they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock the steering
rods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The strain on the steering rod is
tremendous. Suddenly, ANAKIN's steering arm breaks, and his Pos starts
spinning.
The release of tension sends SEBULBA into an ancient statue. One engine
EXPLODES, then the other. SEBULBA skids through the fire-balls, blackened,
but unhurt. He slides to a smoking stop, gets out of his racer, and throws
what's left of a shifter arm on the ground. Suddenly he realizes his pants
are on fire, and he struggles to put them out. ANAKIN flies through the
EXPLOSION as the crowd stands, CHERRING. PADME and JAR JAR jump up and down
with excitment, PADME screaming for joy. ARTOO and KITSTER whistle
hysterically. QUI-GON and SHMI smile. ANAKIN races over the finish line,
the winner.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCERS BOX - DAY (FX)

The two-headed announcer excitedly calls the finish.

FODE BEED : -
B : It's Skywalker! The crowd are going nuts! Oh Ah Oh Ah (rock head in
tandem with partner)

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - DAY

As ANAKIN stops the Podracer, KISTER turns up, and they embrace. Hundreds
of SPECTATORS join them and put ANAKIN on their shoulders, marching off,
CHEERING AND CHANTING. Darth Maul's PROBE DROIDS move through the crowd.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - PRIVATE BOX - DAY

Several ALIENS leave Watto's box, laughing and counting their money. WATTO
sees QUI-GON standing in the doorway.

WATTO : You! You swindled me! You knew the boy was going to win! Somehow
you knew it! I lost everything.

WATTO flies up to QUI-GON and puts his face right up against QUI-GON's.
QUI-GON simply smiles.

QUI-GON : Whenever you gamble, my freind, eventually you'll lose. Bring the
parts to the main hanger. I'll come by your shop later so you can release
the boy.
WATTO : You can't have him! It wasn't a fair bet!
QUI-GON : Would you like to discuss it with the Hutts...I'm sure they can
settle this.
WATTO : No, no! I want no more of your tricks! Take him!

The SITH PROBE DROID watches with great interest.

EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

The Main Hanger is almost deserted as RACERS depart.

INT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

JAR JAR gives ANAKIN a great hug, then PADME gives him a hug, then SHMI.

ANAKIN : Ah, gee...enough of this...
SHMI : It's so wonderful, Annie. You have brought hope to those who have
none. I'm so very proud of you...
PADME : We owe you everything.
ANAKIN : Just feeling this good was worth it.

In the background, QUI-GON has harnessed the EOPIES to containers full of
parts.

QUI-GON : Padme. Jar Jar, let's go, we've got to get these parts back to
the ship.

The GROUP walks over to QUI-GON and the EOPIES.
PADME climbs on behind QUI-GON. JAR JAR swings up onto the second EOPIE,
only to slwly slide off the other side. ARTOO whistles. ANAKIN and SHMI
wave as they ride off.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) I'll return the eopies by midday.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

ARTOO cruises ahead of QUI-GON and PADME, who are riding one of the EOPIES;
JAR JAR ridses the other. They stop in front of the sleek Naboo spacecraft.
OBI-WAN comes out of the ship and joins them.

QUI-GON : Start getting this hyperdrive generator installed. I'm going
back...some unfinished business. I won't be long.
OBI-WAN : Why do I sense we've picked up another pathetic life form...?
QUI-GON : It's the boy who's responsible for getting those parts.

On a hill far overlooking the Naboo spacecraft, the SITH PROBE DROID turns
and speeds away.

EXT. TATOOINE - STREET - SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY

ANAKIN and A GREEDO are rolling around on the floor, fighting. About A
DOZEN OR SO KIDS are standing around them, yelling. Suddenly, a long shadow
is cast over the TWO BOYS; they stop fighting and look up. QUI-GOMN is
towering above them. KITSTER is with them.

QUI-GON : What's this?
ANAKIN : He said I cheated.
QUI-GON : Did you?
ANAKIN : No!
QUI-GON : Do you still think he cheated?
GREEDO : Yes.
QUI-GON : Well, Annie. You know the truth... You will have to tolerate his
opinion, fighting won't change it.

QUI-GON moves off down the street. Anakin follows. The GREEDO wanders over
to WALD who has been watching the goings-on.

WALD : Keep this up, Greedo, and you're gonna come to a bad end.

Farther down the street QUI-GON and ANAKIN head toward Anakin's hovel.
QUI-GON takes a handful of credits from beneath his poncho and hands them
to the boy.

QUI-GON : These are yours. We sold the Pod.
ANAKIN : (suddenly beaming) Yes!

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

SHMI is cleaning up as ANAKIN bursts through the door, followed by QUI-GON.

ANAKIN : Mom, he sold the Pod. Look at all the money we have!

ANAKIN pulls a bag of coins out of his pocket.

SHMI : Oh, my goodness, That's wonderful.
QUI-GON : And Anakin has been freed.
ANAKIN : What?!?
QUI-GON : You're no longer a slave.

ANAKIN jumps for joy! SHMI is stunned.

ANAKIN : Did you hear that, Mom? (to Qui-Gon) Was that part of the prize,
or what?
QUI-GON : Let's just say Watto has learned an important lesson about
gambling.
SHMI : Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie. You're free! (turns
to Qui-Gon) Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi?
QUI-GON : Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident.
You are strong with the Force, but you may not be accepted by the Coucil.
ANAKIN : A Jedi! Mighty blasters, you mean I get to go with you in your
starship and everything?!

QUI-GON kneels down to the boy.

QUI-GON : Anakin, training to be a Jedi will not be a easy challenge. And
if you succeed, it will be a hard life.
ANAKIN : But it's what I want. What I've always dreamed about. Can I go,
Mom?!
QUI-GON : This path has been placed for you, Annie; the choice to take it
is yours alone.

ANAKIN thinks, looks to his mother, then to QUI-GON.

ANAKIN : I want to go.
QUI-GON : Then, pack your things. We haven't much time.
ANAKIN : Yipee!!

ANAKIN hugs his mom and starts for the other room, then stops. SHMI and
QUI-GON give each other a knowing look. ANAKIN has realized something.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) What about Mom? Is she free too? You're coming, aren't
you, Mom
QUI-GON : I tried to free your mother, Annie, but Watto wouldn't have it.
ANAKIN : But the money from selling...
QUI-GON : It's not nearly enough.

SHMI comes over to her son and sits next to him. Taking both of his hands
in hers, she draws him close.

SHMI : Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let
go...to let go of me. I cannot go with you.
ANAKIN : I want to stay with you. I don't want things to change.
SHMI : You can't stop change any more than you can stop the suns from
setting. Listen to your feelings; Annie, you know what's right.

ANAKIN takes a deep breath, drops his head. QUI-GON and SHMI exchange a
look of concern. When ANAKIN raises up, there are tears in his eyes.

ANAKIN : I'm going to miss you so much, Mom...
SHMI : I love you, Annie...now hurry.

ANAKIN and SHMI hug. ANAKIN runs into the other room.

SHMI : (Cont'd) Thank you.
QUI-GON : I will watch after him. You have my word. Will you be all right?
SHMI : He was in my life for such a short time.

INT. ANAKIN'S HOVEL - SECOND ROOM - DAY

ANAKIN has thrown the last of his things in a small backpack. As he leaves,
he stops and pushes the button that wakes his droid up. THREEPIO stares at
him blankly.

ANAKIN : Well, Threepio, I'm free...and I'm going away...in a starship...
THREEPIO : Master, Annie, you are my maker, and I wish you well. Although
I'd like it better if I were a little less naked.
ANAKIN : I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, Threepio...give you
coverings and all... I'm going to miss working on you. You've been a great
pal. I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything. Bye.

THREEPIO stares at ANAKIN as he rushes out of the room.

THREEPIO : Sell me?!?

EXT. MOS ESPA - STREET - SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY

KITSTER runs up to ANAKIN as he and QUI-GON exit Anakin's hovel. SHMI
stands in the doorway. ANAKIN pulls a handful of coins out of his pocket
and gives them to KITSTER.

KITSTER : There are so many of us who want you to stay, Annie... You're a
hero.
ANAKIN : I... (looks to SHMI) I... have to go.

QUI-GON has moved a short way down the street.

KITSTER : Well.
ANAKIN : Well.
KITSTER : Thank's for every moment you've been here. You're my best friend.
ANAKIN : I won't forget.

ANAKIN hugs KITSTER and runs toward QUI-GON, then stops to look back at his
mother standing in the doorway. He turns back to QUI-GON, then turns and
runs back to his mother.

ANAKIN : (starting to cry) I can't do it, Mom. I just can't.

SHMI hugs ANAKIN. QUI-GON watches from the distance. She kneels down and
looks him in the face.

SHMI : Annie, remember when you climbed the great dune in order to chase
the Banthas away so they wouldn't be shot... Remember how you collapses
several times, exhausted thinking you couldn't do it?

ANAKIN shakes his head.

SHMI : (Cont'd) This is one of those times when you have to do something
you don't think you can do. I know how strong you are, Annie. I know you
can do this...
ANAKIN : Will I ever see you again?
SHMI : What does your heart tell you?
ANAKIN : I hope so...yes...I guess.
SHMI : Then we will see each other again.
ANAKIN : I.. will become a Jedi and I will come back and free you, Mom...I
promise.
SHMI : No matter where you are, my love will be with you. Now be brave, and
don't look back... don't look back.
ANAKIN : I love you so much.

SHMI hugs ANAKIN, then turns him around so he is facing QUI-GON, and off he
marches, like the brave little trooper that he is. He marches right past
QUI-GON, starring right ahead, tears in his eyes, determined not to look
back.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT MESA - DAY

The PROBE DROID beeps and whistles to DARTH MAUL. The SITH LORD gets on a
speeder bike and follows the PROBE DROID into Mos Espa.

EXT MOS ESPA - STREET - FRUIT STAND - DAY

ANAKIN and QUI-GON exit WATTO'S and stop before JIRA'S fruit stand. ANAKIN
hands JIRA some coins.

ANAKIN : I've been freed, and I'm going away. Buy yourself a cooling unit
with this... Otherwise I'll worry about you.

JIRA is astonished. She stares, not knowing what to say.

JIRA : Can I give you a hug
ANAKIN : Sure.

She gives him a hug.

JIRA : I'll miss you, Annie.. there isn't a kinder boy in the galaxy. You
be careful...

ANAKIN runs to join QUI-GON, who has already started down the street. As
they walk along together, QUI-GON notices something out of the corner of
his eye.
Suddenly, without breaking his stride, he ignites his laser sword, swing
around, and lunges forward and cuts a lurking PROBE DROID in half. QUI-GON
inspects the sparking and fizzing DROID.

ANAKIN : What is it?
QUI-GON : Probe droid. Very unusual... not like anything I've seen before.
Come on.

QUI-GON and ANAKIN start running.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

QUI-GON and ANAKIN run toward the Naboo spacecraft. ANAKIN is having a hard
time keeping up.

ANAKIN : Master Qui-Gon,sir, wait!

QUI-GON turns to answer and sees a DARK-CLOAKED FIGURE bearing down on a
speeder bike.

QUI-GON : Anakin, drop!

ANAKIN drops to the ground just as DARTH MAUL sweeps over him. DARTH MAUL
jumps off his speeder bike, and before he has hit the ground, the Sith Lord
has swund a death blow with his laser sword that is barely blocked by
QUI-GON.
ANAKIN picks himself up. The two galactic warriors, Sith and Jedi, are
bashing each other with incredible blows. They move in a continual cloudof
dust, smashing everything around them. This is a fierce fight. ANAKIN gets
up, bewildered by the confrontation.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Annie, get to the ship! Take off! Go! Go!

QUI-GON struggles to fend off the relentless onslaught as ANAKIN races to
the ship.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - HALLWAY

ANAKIN runs into the main hallway of the spaceship, where PADME and CAPTAIN
PANAKA are working.

ANAKIN : Qui-Gon's in trouble. He says to take off...now!!
CAPT. PANAKA : Who are you?
PADME : He's a friend.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

CAPTAIN PANAKA, ANAKIN, and PADME rush into the cockpit where OBI-WAN and
RIC OLIE are checking the hyperdrive.

CAPT. PANAKA : Qui-Gon is in trouble, he says to take off!
PILOT : I don't see anything.
OBI-WAN : Over there! Fly low!

In the distance is a small cloud of dust.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL continue theirsword battle. Leaping over one another
in an incredible display of acrobatics, the two warrios hear the ship fly
over them a few feet off the ground. QUI-GON almost dissapears for a
moment.
Before DARTH MAUL knows what's happening, QUI-GON is on the spacecrat's
ramp.

EXT. TATOOINE - NABOO SPACECRAFT RAMP - DAY

The SITH LORD immediately jumps onto the ramp after QUI-GON, but barely
makes it. His heels hang over the edge of a forty-foot drop. QUI-GON swings
his laser sword with all his might and knocks DARTH AMUL off the ramp and
onto the desert floor. The ramp closes, and the Naboo craft rockets away,
leaving the Sith Lord standing alone.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The sleek spacecraft rockets away from the planet Tatooine.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - HALLWAY

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN rush into the hallway to find QUI-GON collapsed on the
floor opposite the entry. ARTOO is looking over him. The JEDI is breathing
hard, wet with sweat and covered in dirt.

ANAKIN : Are you all right?
QUI-GON : I think so... that was a surpirse I wont soon forget.
OBI-WAN : What was it?
QUI-GON : I don't know... but he was well trained in the Jedi arts. My
guess is he was after the Queen...
ANAKIN : Do you think he'll follow us?
QUI-GON : We'll be safe enough once we're in hyperspace, but I have no
doubt he knows our destination.
ANAKIN : What are we going to do about it?

OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a "who are you?" look. ANAKIN returns an innocent
stare.

QUI-GON : We will be patient. Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.
ANAKIN : Pleased to meet you. Wow! You're a Jedi too?

OBI-WAN gives the boy a skeptical look.

INT. COCKPIT - SPACE

RIC OLIE pulls back on the hyperdrive. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN watch.

QUI-GON : Let's hope this hyperdrive works and Watto didn't get the last
laugh.

The stars streak outside the cockpit window.

EXT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT (FX)

The ship streaks into hyperspace.

EXT. THEED - STREET - NIGHT (FX)

SEVERAL FEDERATION DROIDS patrol a deserted city street. The Palace can be
seen in the distance.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT

NUTE sits in a strange, mechanical walking chair, which approaches SIO
BIBBLE and SEVERAL OTHER NABOO OFFICIALS. RUNE follows a few paces behind.
DROID GUARDS surround SIO BIBBLE and THE OTHERS as FOUR COUNCIL MEMBERS
watch.

NUTE : When are you going to give up this pointless strike? Your Queen is
lost, your people are starving, and you, Governor, are going to die, much
sooner than your people, I'm afraid. Take him away!
BIBBLE : This invasion will gain you nothing. We're a democracy. The people
have decided... They will not live under your tyranny.

BIBBLE is taken away as OOM-9 approaches NUTE.

OOM-9 : My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps for these
rumored underwater villages... they will not stay hidden for long.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

The ship is asleep. The lights are dim as PADME walks into the main room.
She goes to a monitor and watches the BIBBLE plea recording. JAR JAR is
stretched out on the floor, snoring. ARTOO is to one side, cooing as he
rests.
PADME appears tired. She senses someone watching her and turns around with
a start. She sees ANAKIN sitting in the corner, shivering and looking
verydejected. She goes over to him. He looks up at her with tears in his
eyes. He is holding his arms to keep himself warm.

PADME : Are you all right?
ANAKIN : It's very cold.

PADME gives him her over-jacket.

PADME : You're from a warm planet, Annie. Too warm for my taste. Space is
cold.
ANAKIN : You seem sad.
PADME : The Queen is...worried. Her people are suffering...dying. She must
convince the Senate to intervene, or...I'm not sure what will happen.
ANAKIN : I'm...I'm not sure what's going to happen to me. I dunno if I'll
ever see you again.. (he pulls something from his pocket) I made this for
you. Sou you'd remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet... It will
bring you good fortune.

ANAKIN hands a wooden pendant to PADME. She inspects it, then puts it
around her neck.

PADME : It's beautiful, but I don't need this to remember you. Many things
will change when we reach the capital, Annie. My caring for you will always
remain.
ANAKIN : I care for you too. Only I...miss...

ANAKIN is disturbed about something. Tears are in his eyes.

PADME : ...You miss your mother.

ANAKIN looks at her, unable to speak. She hugs him.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

ANAKIN looks out the cockpit window in awe.

RIC OLIE : Coruscant...the capital of the Republic...the entire planet is
one big city.
ANAKIN : Wow! It's so huge!

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY (FX)

The ship flies through the cityscape of Coruscant.

EXT. CORUSCANT - SENATE LANDING PLATFORM - DAY

Supreme Chancellor VALORUM, SEVERAL GUARDS, and SENATOR PALPATINE stand on
a landing platform.
The sleek Naboo spacecraft lands on the platform high above the street
level of the galactic capital. The ramp lowers. OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, JAR JAR
and ANAKIN descend the ramp first and bow before PALPATINE and VALORUM.
CAPTAIN PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, QUEEN AMIDALA, then PADME, RABE, EIRTAE,
and
MORE GUARDS descend the ramp. QUEEN AMIDALA stops before the group.
ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand to one side, looking at the huge city. PADME
smiles at ANAKIN. PALPATINE bows before the Queen.

PALPATINE : It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. May I
present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.
VALORUM : Welcome, Your Highness. It is an honor to finally meet you in
person. I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the currant
situation. I've called for a special session of the Senate to hear your
position.
AMIDALA : I am grateful for your concern, Chancellor.

PALPATINE starts to lead QUEEN AMIDALA and her RETINUE off the platform
toward a waiting air taxi.

PALPATINE : There is a question of precedure, but I feel confident we can
overcome it...

JAR JAR and ANAKIN start to follow, then stop, noticing that OBI-WAN and
QUI-GON are staying with the SUPREME CHANCELLOR. QUEEN AMIDALA waves to the
duo to follow her. ANAKIN looks back to QUI-GON, and he nods to go ahead.
ANAKIN and JAR JAR join the QUEEN, PALPATINE, PADME, RABE and EIRTAE in the
taxi. PALPATINE gives the Gungan and the boy in the back of the taxi a
skeptical look. JAR JAR leans over to ANAKIN.

JAR JAR : Da Queens- a bein grossly nice, mesa tinks. (he looks around)
Pitty hot!

VALORUM and the JEDI watch the taxi move off into the city.

QUI-GON : I must speak with the Jei Council immediately, Your Honor. The
situation has become more complicated.

INT. PALPATINE'S QUARTERS - ANTEROOM - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA is sitting listening to PALPATINE. EIRTAE and RABE stand
behind the QUEEN; PADME is nowhere to be sen. ANAKIN and JAR JAR are
waiting in an adjoining room. They can see the Queen but cannot hear what
is being said.

JAR JAR : Dissen all pitty odd to my.
ANAKIN : Don't look at me. I don't know what's going on.

CAPTAIN PANAKA enters, then goes into the room with QUEEN AMIDALA.

INT. PALPATINE'S QUARTERS - LIVING AREA - DAY

PALPATINE is pacing as CAPTAIN PANAKA enters. EIRTAE and RABE stand to one
side.

PALPATINE : ...the Republic is not what it once was. The Senate is full of
greedy, squabbling delegates who are only looking out for themselves and
their home sytems. There is no interest in the common good...no civility,
only politics...its disgusting. I must be frank, Your Majesty, there is
little chance the Senate will act on the invasion.
AMIDALA : Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.
PALPATINE : If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real
power...he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption. A
manufactured scandal surrounds him. The bureaucrats are in charge now.
AMIDALA : What options do we have?
PALPATINE : Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger
Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforces
the laws, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence
in Chancellor Valorum.
AMIDALA : He has been our strongest supporter. Is there any other way?
PALPATINE : Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the
courts...
AMIDALA : There's no time for that. The courts take even longer to decide
things than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator...more and more each
day. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.
PALPATINE : To be realistic, Your Highness, I'd say we're going to have to
accept Federation control for the time being.
AMIDALA : There is something I cannot do.

EXT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - DAY (FX)

A unique building with it tall spires stands out against the Coruscant
skyline. A small transport passes by the vast temple.

INT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY

QUI-GON stands in a tall stately room. Twelve JEDI sit in a semi-circle.
OBI-WAN stands behind QUI-GON in the center of the room.
The Senior Jedi is MACE WINDU. To his left is an alien Jedi named
KI-ADI-MUNDI, and to his right, the Jedi Master, YODA.

QUI-GON : ...my only conclusion can be that it was a Sith Lord.
MACE WINDU : A Sith Lord?!?
KI-ADI : Impossible! The Sith have been extinct for a millenium.
YODA : The very Republic is threatened, if involved the Sith are.
MACE WINDU : I do not believe they could have returned without us knowing.
YODA : Hard to see, the dark side is. Discover who this assassin is, we
must.
KI-ADI : I sense he will reveal himself again.
MACE WINDU : This attack was with purpose, that is clear, and I agree the
Queen is the target.
YODA : With this Naboo queen you must stay, Qui-Gon. Protect her.
MACE WINDU : We will use all our resources here to unravel this mystery and
discover the identity of your attacker... May the Force be with you.
YODA : May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN turns to leave, but QUI-GON continues to face the Council.

YODA : (Cont'd) Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?
QUI-GON : With your permission, my Master. I have encountered a vergence in
the Force.
YODA : A vergence, you say?
MACE WINDU : Located around a person?
QUI-GON : A boy... his cells have the highest concentration of
midi-chlorians I have seen in a life form. It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.
MACE WINDU : You're referring to the prophesy of the one who will bring
balance to the Force...you believe it's this boy??
QUI-GON : I don't pressume...
YODA : But you do! Rrevealed your opinion is.
QUI-GON : I request the boy be tested.

The JEDI all look to one another. They nod and turn back to OBI-WAN and
QUI-GON.

YODA : Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?
QUI-GON : Finding him was the will of the Force...I have no doubt of that.
There is too much happening here...
MACE WINDU : Bring him before us, then.
YODA : Tested he will be.

INT. QUEENS QUARTERS - CORUSCANT - DAY Anakin, tentative, walks down one of
the long hallways in Senator Palpatine's quarters. He stops before a dor
that is flanked by TWO GUARDS.

GUARD : May I help you, son?
ANAKIN : I'm...I'm looking for the handmaiden, Padme.

The GUARD speaks into his comlink as ANAKIN looks around a bit nervously.

GUARD : The boy is here to see Padme.
RABE : Send him in.

The doors open, and ANAKIN enters the Queen's quarters.
RABE greets ANAKIN as TWO OTHER HANDMAIDENS come and go into the next room.

ANAKIN : I'd like to speak with Padme, if I could.
RABE : I'm sorry, Annie. Padme is not here right now.

The Queen speaks out in the next room.

AMIDALA : (O.S.) Who is it?
RABE : Anakin Skywalker, to see Padme, Your Highness.

The QUEEN moves into the doorway and studies ANAKIN. ANAKIN bows and looks
down, then takes a peek at her.

AMIDALA : I've sent Padme on an errand.
ANAKIN : I'm going to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope.

The QUEEN just stares at him.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I may not see her again...and... I just wanted to say
goodbye.
AMIDALA : We will tell her for you. We're sure her heart goes with you.

ANAKIN bows again.

ANAKIN : Thank you, Your Highness. I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

The QUEEN dissapears behind the doorway, and ANAKIN exits.

EXT. CORUSCANT - GALACTIC SENATE BUILDING - DAY (FX)

A large, distinctive looking domed building stands out amid the cityscape
of Coruscant.

INT. MAIN ROTUNDA - GALACTIC SENATE - DAY

The Senate chambers are huge. Thousands of SENATORS and their AIDES sit in
the circular assembly area. CHANCELLOR VALORUM sits in an elevated area in
the center. Hindreds of AIDES and DROIDS hurry about. SENATOR PALPATINE,
QUEEN AMIDALA, EIRTA, RABE, and CAPTAIN PANAKA sit in the Naboo
congressional box, which is actually a floating platform. PALPATINE leans
over to the QUEEN.

PALPATINE : If the Federation moves to defer the motion...Your Majesty,
Ibeg of you to ask for a resolution to end this congressional session.
AMIDALA : I wish I had your confidence in this, Senator.
PALPATINE : You must force a new election for Supreme Chancellor...I
promise you there are many who will support us...it is our best chance...
Your Majesty, our only, chance.
AMIDALA : You truely believe Chancellor Valorum will not bring our motion
to a vote?
PALAPATINE : He is distracted...he is afraid. He will be of no help.
VALORUM : The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of
Naboo.

The Naboo congressional box floats into the center.

PALPATINE : Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy has
occured on our peaceful system of Naboo. We have become caugt in a dispute
you're all well aware of, which began right here with the taxation of trade
routes, and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppresion of the
Trade Federation.

A second box rushes into the center of the Senate. It is filled with
Federation trade barons led by LOTT DOD, the Senator for the Federation.

LOTT DOD : This is outrageous! I object to the Senator's statements!
VALORUM : The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade
Federation at this time. Please return to your station.

LOTT DOD reluctantly moves back to his place.

PALPATINE : To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, the recently
elected ruler of Naboo, to speak on our behalf.

QUEEN AMIDALA stands and addresses the assembly. There is some applause.

AMIDALA : Honorable representatives of the Republic, distinguished
delegates, and Your Honor Supreme Chancellor Valorum, I come to you under
the gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by force.
Invaded...against all the laws of the Republic by the Droid Armies of the
Trade...
LOTT DOD : I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We recommend a
commision be sent to Naboo to assertain the truth.
VALORUM : Overruled.
LOTT DOD : Your Honor, you cannot allow us to be condemned without
reasonable observation. It's against all the rules of procedure.

A third box representing Malastare moves into the center of the room. AKS
MOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention.

AKS MOE : The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate
from the Trade Federation. A commision must be appointed...that is the law.
VALORUM : The point...

VALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN MAS AMEDDA.
PALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN.

PALPATINE : Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on
the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor
Valorum's strength will dissapear.
VALORUM : The point is conceded...Section 523A take precedence here. Queen
Amidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to
explore the validity of your accusations?

QUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.

AMIDALA : (angrily) I will not defer...I have come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people
suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body
is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a
"vote of no confidence"...in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.
VALORUM : What?...No!

This causes a great stir in the assembly. A loud mumur cresendos into a
roar of approval and jeers. CHANCELLOR VALORUM is stunned and stands
speechless. His Vice Chair, MAS AMEDDA, takes over.

MAS AMEDDA : Order! We shall have order...

Things settledown a little. The Federation box settles next to AMIDALA.
PRINCE BAIL ORGANA moves his box into the arena.

BAIL ORGANA : Alderaan seconds the motion for a vote of no confidence in
Chancellor Valorum.
MAD AMEDDA : The motion has been seconded by Bail Organa of Alderaan.

MAS AMEDDA turns to the confused VALORUM, and whispers something to him.

BAIL ORGANA : There must be no delays. The motion is on the floor and must
be voted upon in this session.
LOTT DOD : The Trade Federation moves the motion be sent to the procedures
committee for study.

The assembly begins to chant. VALORUM talks to MAS AMEDDA.

ASSEMBLY : Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!

PALPATINE stands next to AMIDALA.

PALPATINE : You see, Your Majaesty, the tide is with us...Valorum will be
voted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new Chancellor, a strong
Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue...
MAS AMEDDA : Thew Supreme Chancellor requests a recess. Tomorrow we will
begin the vote.

The Federation delegation is furious. VALORUM turns to PALPATINE.

VALORUM : Palpatine, I thought you were my ally...my friend. You have
betrayed me! How could you do this?

EXT. PALACE OF THE JEDI - BALCONY - SUNSET

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand outside the palace on a balcony.

OBI-WAN : The boy will not pass the Council's tests, Master, and you know
it. He is far too old.
QUI-GON : Anakin will become A Jedi...I promise you.
OBI-WAN : Don't defy the Council, Master..not again.
QUI-GON : I will do what I must.
OBI-WAN : Master, you could be sitting on the Council by now if you would
just follow the code. They will not go along with you this time.
QUI-GON : You still have much to learn, my young apprentice.

INT. PALACE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - SUNSET

ANAKIN stands before the TWELVE JEDI. MACE WINDU holds a small hand-held
viewing screen. In rapid succession, images flash across the screen.

ANAKIN : A ship...a cup...a speeder.

MACE WINDU turns the viewing screen off and nods toward YODA.

YODA : Good, good, young one. How feel you?
ANAKIN : Cold, sir.
YODA : Afraid are you?
ANAKIN : No, sir.
MACE WINDU : Afraid to give up your life?
ANAKIN : I don't think so.

ANAKIN hesitates for a moment.

YODA : See through you, we can.
MACE WINDU : Be mindful of your feelings...
KI-ADI : YOur thoughts dwell on your mother.
ANAKIN : I miss her.
YODA : Afraid to lose her..I think.
ANAKIN : (a little angry) What's that got to do with anything?
YODA : Eveything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to
anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.
ANAKIN : (angrily) I am not afraid!
YODA : A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. I
sense much fear in you.
ANAKIN : (quietly) I am not afraid.
YODA : Then continue, we will.

INT. PALPATINES QUARTERS - SUNSET

QUEEN AMIDALA is standing, staring out the window, with JAR JAR. The lights
of the city shimmer before them. EIRTAE and SABE stand near the door. JAR
JAR turns to face the QUEEN and sees her sadness.

JAR JAR : Mesa wonder why da guds invent pain?
AMIDALA : To motivate us, I imagine...
JAR JAR : Yousa tinken yousa people ganna die?
AMIDALA : I don't know.
JAR JAR : Gungans ganna get pasted too, eh?
AMIDALA : I hope not.
JAR JAR : Gungans do die'n without a fight.... wesa warriors. Wesa gotta
grand army. Dat why you no liken us, metinks.

PALPATINE and CAPTAIN PANAKA rush into the rom and bow before the QUEEN.

CAPT. PANAKA : Your Highness, Senator Palpatine has been nominated to
succeed Valorum as Supreme Chancellor.
PALPATINE : A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. I promise, Your
Majesty, if I am elected, I will bring democracy back to the Republic. I
will put an end to corruption. The Trade Fedreation will lose its influence
over the bureaucrats, and our people will be freed.
AMIDALA : Who else can be nominated?
CAPT. PANAKA : Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.
PALPATINE : I feel confident...our "situation" will create a strong
sympaphy vote for us... I will be Chancellor, I promise you.
AMIDALA : I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, Senator,
there will be nothing left of our cities, our people, our way of life...
PALPATINE : I understand your concern, Your Majesty; unfortunately, the
Federation has possession of our planet. The law is in their favor.
AMIDALA : With the Senate in transition, there is nothing more I can do
here...Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine. I have
decided to go back to Naboo. My place is with my people.
PALPATINE : Go back!! But, Your Majesty, be realistic! You would be in
danger. They will force you to sign the treaty.
AMIDALA : I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different from
that of our people. Captain!
CAPT. PANAKA : Yes, Your Highness?
AMIDALA : Ready my ship!
CAPT. PANAKA : Please, Your Majesty, stay here...where it's safe.
AMIDALA : No place is safe, if the Senate doesn't condemn this invasion. It
is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions as a democracy. If
you win the election, Senator, I know you will do everything possible to
stop the Federation. I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to
the Senate.

AMIDALA and her RETINUE exit the room. PALPATINE has a self-satisfied smile
on his face.

INT. TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - TWILIGHT

ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON stand before the TWELVE MEMBERS OF THE JEDI
COUNCIL.

YODA : ...Correct you were, Qui-Gon.
MACE WINDU : His cells contain a high concentration of midi-chlorians.
KI-ADI : The Force is strong with him.
QUI-GON : He's to be trained, then.

The COUNCIL MEMBERS look to one another.

MACE WINDU : No. He will not be trained.

ANAKIN is crestfallen; tears begin to form in his eyes.

QUI-GON : No??!!

OBI-WAN smiles.

MACE WINDU : He is too old. There is already too much anger in him.
QUI-GON : He is the chosen one...you must see it.
YODA : Clouded, this boy's future is. Masked by his youth.
QUI-GON : I will trin him, then. I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

OBI-WAN reacts with surprise. ANAKIN watches with interest.

YODA : An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second.
MACE WINDU : We forbid it.
QUI-GON : Obi-Wan is ready...
OBI-WAN : Iam ready to face the trials.
YODA : Ready so early, are you? What know you of ready?

ANAKIN watches as QUI-GON and OBI-WAN exchange angry looks.

QUI-GON : Headstrong....and he has much to learn about the living Force,
but he is capabe. There is little more he will learn from me.
YODA : Our own council we will keep on who is ready. More to learn, he
has...
MACE WINDU : Now is not the time for this...the Senate is voting for a new
Spreme Chancellor. Queen Amidala is returning home, which will put pressure
on the Federation, and could widen the confrontation.
YODA : And draw out the Queen's attacker.
KI-ADI : Events are moving fast...too fast.
MACE WINDU : Go with the Queen to Naboo and discover the identity of the
dark warrior. That is the clue we need to unravel this mystery of the Sith.

YODA : Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.
QUI-GON : I brought Anakin here; he must stay in my charge. He has nowhere
else to go.
MACE WINDU : He is your ward, Qui-Gon...we will not dispute that.
YODA : Train him not. Take him with you, but train him not!
MACE WINDU : Protect the Queen, but do not intercede if it comes to war
until we have the Senate's approval.
YODA : May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN leave.

EXT. CORUSCANT - SENATE LANDING PLATFORM - NIGHT

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and ANAKIN stand on the landing platform outside the
ship. ARTOO whistles a happy tune as he leans over the edge of the
platform, watching the traffic. Suddenly, he leans over too far and falls
overboard. After a moment, he reappears, using his on-board jets to propel
himself back onto the landing platform. The wind whips at ANAKIN as he
listens to the JEDI.

OBI-WAN : It is not disrespect, Master, it is the truth.
QUI-GON : From your point of view....
OBI-WAN : The boy is dangerous...they all sense it. Why can't you?
QUI-GON : His fate is uncertain, not dangerous. The Council will decide
Anakin's future...that should be enough for you. Now get on board!
OBI-WAN reluctantly boards the Naboo spacecraft followed by ARTOO. QUI-GON
goes over to ANAKIN.
ANAKIN : Master Qui-Gon, sir, I do not wish to be a problem.
QUI-GON : You won't be, Annie....I'm not allowed to train you, so I want
you to watch me and be mindful...always remember, your focus determines
your reality. Stay close to me and you will be safe.
ANAKIN : Master, sir...I've been wondering...what are midi-chlorians?
QUI-GON : Midi-chlorians are a microcopic lifeform that reside within all
living cells and communicates with the Force.
ANAKIN : They live inside of me?
QUI-GON : In your cells. We are symbionts with the midi-chlorians.
ANAKIN : Symbionts?
QUI-GON : Life forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the
midi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge of the
Force. They continually speak to you, telling you the will of the Force.
ANAKIN : They do??
QUI-GON : When you learn to quiet your mind, you will hear them speaking to
you.
ANAKIN : I don't understand.
QUI-GON : With time and training, Annie...you will.

Two taxis pull up, and CAPTAIN PANAKA, SENATOR PALPATINE, TWENTY OR SO
TROOPS, GUARDS, and OFFICERS walk briskly toward the ship, followed by
QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTAE, and finally, JAR JAR. AMIDALA and her
HANDMAIDENS stop before the JEDI.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) Your Highness, it is our pleasure to continue to serve
and protect you.
AMIDALA : I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine fears the Federation means
to destroy me.
QUI-GON : I promise you, I will not let that happen.

AMIDALA enters the ship, followed by her HANDMAIDENS. JAR JAR hugs QUI-GON
and ANAKIN.

JAR JAR : Wesa goen home!

They ALL move onto the ship. The ship takes off.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - THEED - NIGHT

NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

DARTH SIDIOUS : The Queen is on her way to you. I regret she is of no
further use to us. When she gets there, destroy her.
NUTE : Yes, my Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Viceroy, is the planet secure?
NUTE : Yes, my Lord, we have taken over the last pockets of primitive life
forms. We are in complete control of the planet now.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Good. I will see to it that in the Senate, things stay as
they are. I am sending Darth Maul to join you. He will deal with the Jedi.
NUTE : Yes, my Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades off.

RUNE : A Sith lord here with us?!!

INT. SPACE - NABOO SPACECRAFT COCKPIT

ANAKIN stands next to the PILOT, RIC OLIE, pointing to various buttons and
gauges.

ANAKIN : ...and that one?
RIC OLIE : The forward stabalizer.
ANAKIN : And those control the pitch?
RIC OLIE : You catch on pretty quick.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEEN'S CHAMBERS

SABE and EIRTAE stand behind QUEEN AMIDALA as she talks with QUI-GON and
CAPTAIN PANAKA. OBI-WAN and JAR JAR watch.

CAPT. PANAKA : The moment we land the Federation will arrest you, and force
you to sign the treaty.
QUI-GON : I agree...I'm not sure what you hope to accomplish by this.
AMIDALA : I'm going to take back what's ours.
CAPT. PANAKA : There are only twelve of us, Your Highness....we have no
army.
QUI-GON : I cannot fight a war for you, Your Highness, only protect you.
AMIDALA : Jar Jar Binks!

JAR JAR looks around, puzzled.

JAR JAR : Mesa, Your Highness?
AMIDALA : Yes. I need your help.

INT. NABOO CRUISER COCKPIT - DAY

The Naboo Cruiser heads toward the lush green planet. There is only one
Federation battle cruiser orbiting. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN PANAKA spot it on
the view screen.

PANAKA : The blockade's gone.
OBI-WAN : The war's over...No need for it now.
RIC OLIE : I have one battleship on my scope.
OBI-WAN : A droid control ship.
PANAKA : They've probably spotted us.
OBI-WAN ; We haven't much time.

INT. NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN HOLD

The QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, TROOPS, and HANDMAIDENS get ready to disembark
as the ship alnds. The elevator door slides open, and ANAKIN emerges into
the hold area. He see PADME and run up to her.

ANAKIN : Hi! Where have you been?
PADME : Annie! What are you doing here?
ANAKIN : I'm with Qui-Gon...but...they're not going to let me be a Jedi.
I'm too old.
PADME : This is going to be dangerous, Annie.
ANAKIN : Is it? I can help... Where are we going?
PADME : To war, I'm afraid. The Queen has had to make the most difficuld
decision of her life. She doesn't believe in fighting, Annie. We are a
peaceful people...
ANAKIN : I want to help...I'm glad you're back.

ANAKIN smiles. PADME smiles back.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - DAY

The Naboo spacecraft has landed in the Gungan swamp. TROOPS unload the
ships in the background as OBI-WAN approaches QUI-GON.

OBI-WAN : Jar Jar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master.

QUI-GON's thoughts are elsewhere.

QUI-GON : Good.

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand silently for a moment.

OBI-WAN : Do you think the Queen's idea will work?
QUI-GON : The Gungans will not easily be swayed, and we cannot use our
power to help her.
OBI-WAN : I'm...I'm sorry for my behavior, Master. It is not my place to
disagree with you about the boy. I am grateful you think I am ready for the
trials.

QUI-GON looks at him for a long moment.

QUI-GON : You have been a good apprentice. You are much wiser than Iam,
Obi-Wan. I foresee you will become a great Jedi Knight.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - UNDERWATER - DAY (FX)

JAR JAR swims down into Bubble City.

INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE

JAR JAR enters the main square of the bubble city. He stands, stunned, in
amazement and fear. He is nervous and shaking.

JAR JAR : Ello! Where das everybody?

The plaza is empty. He notices that many of the buildings are shot up as if
there had been a battle of some kind.

EXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - DAY

JAR JAR exits the swamp lake and walks over to QUEEN AMIDALA, CAPTAIN
PANAKA, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON. PADME, EIRTAE, RABE, ANAKIN, and ARTOO,
FOUR
PILOTS, and EIGHT GUARDS stand in the background near the starship.

JAR JAR : Dare-sa nobody dare. All gone. Some kinda fight, I tink. Sorry,
no Gungas...no Gungas.
CAPT. PANAKA : Do you think they have been taken to camps?
OBI-WAN : More likely they were wiped out.
JAR JAR : No...mesa no tink so. Gungan hiden. When in trouble, go to sacred
place. Mackineeks no find them dare.
QUI-GON : Do you know where they are?

EXT. NABOO SWAMP - DAY

The GROUP follows JAR JAR as he moves through the swamp. JAR JAR stops and
sniffs the air. The GROUP stop behind him.

JAR JAR : Dissen it.

JAR JAR makes a strange chattering noise. Suddenly, out of nowhere, CAPTAIN
TARPALS and SIX OTHER GUNGAN TROOPS riding on KAADUS emerge from the brush.

JAR JAR : (Cont'd) Heyo-dalee, Captain Tarpals.
CAPT. TARPALS : Binks!! Noah gain!
JAR JAR : We comen to see da boss.

CAPTIAN TARPALS rolls his eyes.

CAPT. TARPALS : Ouch time, Binks... Ouch time for all-n youse.

EXT. NABOO SACRED TEMPLE RUINS - DAY

JAR JAR, QUEEN AMIDALA, ANAKIN, ARTOO, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, PADME, RABE,
EIRTAE, and the rest of her group are led through a clearing full of GUNGAN
refugees. At the far end are the ruins of a grand temple with massive
carved heads. BOSS NASS and several other COUNCIL MEMBERS walk out on the
top of a three-quarter-submerged head.

BOSS NASS : Jar Jar, yousa payen dis time. Who's da uss-en others??

QUEEN AMIDALA steps forward. CAPTAIN PANAKA and the JEDI stand behind her.

AMIDALA : I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo...I come before you in peace.
BOSS NASS : Naboo biggen. Yousa bringen da Mackineeks... Dya busten uss-en
omm. Yousa all bombad. Yousa all die'n, mesa tink.

CAPTAIN PANAKA and HALF A DOZEN GUARDS and PILOTS look around nervously,
and the GUNGAN TROOPS lower their long power poles. The JEDI stay relaxed.
ANAKIN watches everything with great interest.

AMIDALA : We wish to form an alliance...

Suddenly, PADME steps forward.

PADME : Your Honor...

ARTOO whistles a quiet "uh oh."

BOSS NASS : Whosa dis?
PADME : I am Queen Amidala (points to Queen) This is my decoy...my
protection...my loyal bodyguard.

ANAKIN is stunned. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON give each other a knowing look.

PADME : (Cont'd) ...I am sorry for my deception, but under the
circumstances it has become necessary to protect myself. Although we do not
always agree, Your Honor, our two great societies have always lived in
peace...until now. The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have
worked so hard to build. You are in hiding, my people are in camps. If we
do not act quickly, all will be lost forever...I ask you to help us...no, I
beg you to help us.

PADME drops to her knees and prostrates herself before BOSS NASS. There is
a gasp from CAPTAIN PANAKA, HIS TROOPS, and the HANDMAIDENS.

PADME : (Cont'd) We are your humble servants...our fate is in your hands.

Slowly, CAPTAIN PANAKA and his TROOPS bow down before the GUNGAN COUNCIL.
Then the HANDMAIDENS, ANAKIN, and finally the JEDI. The GUNGANS are puzzled
by this. BOSS NASS begins to laugh.

BOSS NASS : Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans.. Mesa like dis.
Maybe wesa bein friends.

INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, and DARTH MAUL walk with a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

NUTE : ...we've sent out patrols. We've already located their starship in
the swamp....It won't be long, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : This is an unexpected move for her. It's too aggresive..
Lord Maul, be mindful.
DARTH MAUL : Yes, my Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Be patient... Let them make the first move.

EXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP  GRASS PLAINS - DAY

A GUNGAN SENTRY sits on top of the ancient temple heah, searching the
landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars. He sees something and yells
down to ANAKIN at the foot of the statue.

GUNGAN LOOKOUT : Daza comen!
ANAKIN : All right. They're here!

ANAKIN yells and runs over to PADME and the JEDI, who are discussing a
battle plan with FIVE GUNGAN GENERALS. SABE and EIRTAE stand nearby. BOSS
NASS puts his arm around JAR JAR.

BOSS NASS : Yousa doen grand. Jar Jar bringen da Naboo together.
JAR JAR : Oh, no, no, no...
BOSS NASS : So, wesa maken yousa Bombad General.
JAR JAR : General??! Oh, no..

JAR JAR's eyes roll back, his tongue flops out and he faints.
FOUR SPEEDERS pull up to the GROUP. CAPTAIN PANAKA and a DOZEN OR SO
GUARDS
and PILOT pile out and join the group.

PADME : What is the situation?
CAPT. PANAKA : Almost everyone's in camps. A few hundred police and guards
have formed an underground movement. I brought as many of the keaders as I
could. The Federation Army's also much larger than we thought, and much
stronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.
PADME : The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw theDroid Army away
from the cities. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the
waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Pnaka will create
a diversion, so that we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy.
Without the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN look on with interest.

PADME : (Cont'd) What do you think, Master Jedi?
QUI-GON : The Viceroy will be well guarded.
CAPT. PANAKA : The difficulty's getting into the throne room. Once we're
inside, we shouldn't have a problem.
QUI-GON : There is a possibility with this diversion many Gungans will be
killed.
BOSS NASS : Wesa ready to do are-sa part.

JAR JAR smiles a very worried and sheepish grin. ANAKIN watches with
interest, as does ARTOO.

PADME : We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send
what pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship which is orbiting
the planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication
and their droids will be helpless.
QUI-GON : A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons
on your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.
OBI-WAN : And there's an even bigger danger. If the Vicroy escapes, Your
Highness, he will return with another droid army.
PADME : That is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything
depends on it.

INT. THEED - PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, DARTH MAUL, OOM-9, and a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS walk through
the throne room.

DARTH SIDIOUS : ...she is more foolish than I thought.
NUTE : We are sending all available troops to meet this army of hers
assembling near the swamp. It appears to be made up of primitives. We do
not expect much resistance.
OOM-9 : I am increasing security at all Naboo detention camps.
DARTH MAUL : I feel there is more to this, My Master. The two Jedi may be
using the Queen for their own purposes.
DARTH SIDIOUS : The Jedi cannot become involved. They can only protect the
Queen. Even Qui-Gon Jinn will not break that conenant.... This will work to
our advantage...
NUTE : I have your approval to proceed then, My Lord.
DARTH SIDIOUS : Proceed. Wipe them put...all of them. INT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE
- DAY (FX)

All is peaceful. SMALL CRITTERS drink out of a large swamp lake. Suddenly
there is a disturbance in the middle of the lake. A rush of bubbles, then a
GUNGAN SOLDIER riding a KAADU emerges from the water, followed by SEVERAL
OTHERS. FROGS and OTHER LITTLE ANIMALS flee in all directions as the GUNGAN
ARMY marches through the swamp. The KAADU shake themselves off as they exit
the lake. When JAR JAR's KAADU shakes off, JAR JAR falls off.
SOLDIERS on huge, lizard-like FAMBAAS with large shield generators mounted
on their backs follow the marching WARRIORS. The GUNGAN ARMY heads out of
the swamp and onto the rolling grassy hills.
HUNDREDS OF GUNGAN WARRIORS march in lon lines toward the horizon.
Federation tanks move up to a ridge and stop. In the distance they see the
GUNGAN ARMY marching toward them. The GUNGAN GENERAL CEEL sees the tanks on
the ridge and orders a halt. The GUNGANS are spread out in a large line.
JAR JAR is nervous. GENERAL CEEL signals to the shield operators.

GENERAL CEEL : Energize the shields.

A red ray shoots out of the generator and blasts into a large dish on the
back of a second FAAMBA and spreads like an umbrella over the assembled
WARRIORS.

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY

PADME, followed by EIRTAE, OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, ANAKIN, and ARTOO, stealthily
makes her way toward the entrance to the main hanger. They are followed by
about TWENTY NABOO GUARDS, PILOTS, and TROOPS. They stop, and PADME uses a
small red laser light to signal across the plaza to CAPTAIN PANAKA, RABE
and TWENTY OTHER ASSORTED NABOO TROOPS. They signal back. QUI-GON leans
over to ANAKIN.

QUI-GON : Once we get inside, Annie, you find a safe placeto hide and stay
there.
ANAKIN : Sure.
QUI-GON : And stay there!

DROID TROOPS mill about the tank-filled plaza. At the far end of the plaza,
SEVERAL DROIDS begin to run and fire. NABOO SOLDIERS begin to fire back at
the BATTLE DROIDS.
As the ruckus erupts at one end of the plaza, PADME and her TROOPS rush
into the main hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS SOLDIERS continue to engage
the DROIDS outside.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

ALARMS ARE SOUNDING a PADME, the JEDI, ANAKIN, EIRTAE, and PADME's TROOPS
rush into the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS begin firing at them as they run for
cover. ANAKIN runs under a Naboo fighter. The JEDI deflect bolts aimed at
PADME back onto the BATTLE DROIDS, causing them to EXPLODE.

INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, and FOUR COUNCIL MEMBERS watch the plaza battle on a large view
screen.

NUTE : I thought the battle was going to take place far from here...this is
too close!
RUNE : What is going on?

DARTH MAUL enters the throne room.

DARTH MAUL : I told you there was more to this...the Jedi are involved.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY (FX)

The Federation tanks begin to fire on the GUNGANS, but they are protected
by their energy shield. The tanks stop firing, and the GUNGANS CHEER, until
they see the doors to the massive transports open, and racks of BATTLE
DROIDS are pulled out and lined up by a squad of STAPS.
The BATTLE DROIDS reconfigure into their standing position. The GUNGANS get
ready for an attack. OOM-9 gives the command to move forward, and THOUSANDS
OF DROIDS march toward the GUNGANS.
The GUNGANS power up their weapons. The DROIDS slowly march through the
protective shield and start firing. The GUNGANS throw their power poles and
fling small balls of energy with slingshots. The WARRIORS dump large balls
of energy into mortars that heat up and fire the energy goo onto the BATTLE
DROIDS, causing them to short out.
The battle rages and the GUNGANS defend their shield generators against the
ARMY OF DROIDS. OOM-9 watches from a tank on a hill overlooking the battle.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

ANAKIN hides behind one of the Naboo fighters, ducking as large bolts whiz
past and EXPLODE near him. PADME and the TWO JEDI destroy BATTLE DROIDS
right and left. The QUEEN'S TROOPS and EIRTAE also blast away at the
DROIDS. PADME signals to her pilots.

PADME : Get to your ships!

The PILOTS and ARTOO UNITS run for the Naboo fighter craft stacked in the
hanger bay. ONE OF THE PILOTS jumps into a fighter right above where ANAKIN
is hiding.

FIGHTER PILOT : Better find a new hiding place, kid. I'm taking this ship.

The ship begins to levitate out of the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS fire at it as
it falls in behind five other fighters. ARTOO whistles to ANAKIN from a
second fighter not far away. ANAKIN runs and jumps into the second fighter
to hide.

EXT. THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY (FX)

Two Naboo starfighters exit the main hanger. A tank fires at them, hitting
one of them, which causes it to pinwheel into the ground and EXPLODE.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

CAPTAIN PANAKA, SABE and NABOO TROOPS rush into the hanger and overwlm the
few remaining BATTLE DROIDS. PADME, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON join forces with
CAPTAIN PANAKA.

PADME : My guess is the Viceroy is in the throne room.

She looks to QUI-GON.

QUI-GON : I agree.

They start to head for the exit, on the way passing the fighter where
ANAKIN is hiding. ARTOO whistles a greeting as ANAKIN peeps out of the
cockpit.

ANAKIN : Hey! Wait for me.
QUI-GON : No, Annie, you stay there. Stay right where you are.
ANAKNI : But, I...
QUI-GON : Stay in that cockpit.

They head for the exit. As they are about to go through the door, suddenly
everyone scatters, revealing DARTH MAUL standing in the doorway. CAPTAIN
PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS back away. QUI-GON and OBI-WAN step forward.

QUI-GON : (Cont'd) We'' handle this...

The TWO JEDI take off their capes and ignite their laser swords. DARTH MAUL
takes off his cape, and ignites his laser sword. Both ends of the sword
light up.
At the far end of the hanger, SIX WHEEL DROIDS roll in and transform into
their battle position. ARTOO calls ANAKIN's attention to the DROIDS. The
JEDI begin to fight the Sith Lord.

ANAKIN : Oh, no...

The DROIDS begin to advance and start firing on PADME and HER TROOPS.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) We gotta do something, Artoo.

ARTOO whistles a reply. Suddenly, the ship's systems go on, and the ship
begins to levitate.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) All right, thanks Artoo! Great idea! I'll take over.
Let's see...

ANAKIN steers the ship toward the DROIDS. He pushes a button, and the ship
begins to shake.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Where's the trigger? Oops, wrong one.. Maybe this one....

ANAKIN pushes a second button, and the lasers begin to fire, wiping out
several DESTROYER DROIDS. ARTOO whistles a cheer.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Yeah, all right. "Droid blaster." Yeah!

The JEDI are engaged in a fierce sword fight with DARTH MAUL. They have
moved into the center of the hanger. While the WHEEL DROIDS are momentarily
distracted by ANAKIN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS exit into a
palace hallway.
The WHEEL DROIDS start firing at ANAKIN. There are EXPLOSIONS all around
him.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops...shield up! Always on the right...shields always on
the right.

ANAKIN flips several switches, and the after-burner ignites.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know we're moving. I'll shut the energy drive down.

The fighter rockets out of the hanger. ARTOO and ANAKIN hold on for dear
life.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops!! Wrong one.

ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'm not doing anything!

ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know...I didn't push anything.

The SITH LORD's moves are incredible. He is fighting the TWO JEDI at once,
flipping into the air, outmaneuvering them at every turn.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

The Naboo fleet leaves the planet and heads toward the space station.

RIC OLIE : Bravo Flight A, take on the fighters. Flight B, make the run on
the transmitter.
BRAVO TWO : Roger, Bravo Leader.

The fleet approaches the space station. Many Federation fighters exit the
hangers and attack.

RIC OLIE : Enemy fighters straight ahead!

EXT. NABOO GRASS PALINS - DAY

JAR JAR's clumsiness works for him in the battle. He gets caught up in the
wiring of a blasted DROID, dragging the torso around with him, the DROID's
gun firing randomly, accidently blasting SEVERAL DROIDS in one process.
OOM-9 decides to send in the WHEEL DROIDS and gives the signal. HUNDREDS OF
WHEEL DROIDS roll out of the transports and head down toward the battle.
They slowly roll through the deflector shields, then transform themselves
once they get on the other side. The GUNGANS blast the WHEEL DROIDS with
energy balls. The DESTROYER DROIDS blast many GUNGANS.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

A giant dogfight ensues. ANAKIN's fighter flies into space above Naboo.
ARTOO beeps a worried concern.

ANAKIN : The Autopilot is searching for what other ships?

ARTOO beeps and whistles.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) There is no manual override, Artoo. You'll have to rewire
it or something.

ARTOO chirps that he's trying.

ANAKIN : (cont'd) Look! There they are! That's where the autopilot is
taking us.

ANAKIN's fighter flies toward the Federation Battleship.

INT. THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

The SITH LORD drives the JEDI out of the hanger and nto the power generator
area next door.

follow, one in front of the SITH LORD and one behind. They continue their
sword fight.

INT. THEED - PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY

PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, EIRTAE, SABE and THIER TROOPS are trapped in a
hallway by BATTLE DROIDS.

PADME : We don't have time for this, Captain.
CAPT. PANAKA : Let's try the outside stairway.

CAPTAIN PANAKA blasts a hole in the window, and they make their way outside
the building onto a ledge about six stories above a raging waterfall. SABE,
EIRTAE and about TWENTY NABOO SOLDIERS stay in the hallway to hold off the
BATTLE DROIDS.

EXT. THEED - PALACE - OVER WATERFALL - DAY

PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and about TEN OTHER NABOO SOLDIERS are lined up
along the edge. They have pulled small attachments out of their pistols and
fire at a ledge about four stories above them. Thin cables shoot out of the
pistols and are embedded into the ledge. PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and the
OTHERS begin to climb up the wall.

EXT . NABOO GRASS PLAINS DAY

The GUNGAN ARMY is no match for the DESTROYER DROIDS. JAR JAR tries to run
from the BATTLE DROIDS.

GENERAL CEEL : Retreat! Retreat!

The GUNGANS begin to turn and run, on foot, on their kaadu, and in wagons.
JAR JAR attempts to escape on a wagon of energy balls but only manages to
unhitch the back gate, causing all of the energy balls to roll out of the
wagon and down the hill. JAR JAR scrambles to avoid being hit by one of the
balls. FOUR DESTROYER DROIDS aren't so lucky. They get blasted by the
energy balls.
The GUNGANS renew their attack on the DROID ARMY. JAR JAR's bumbling
destroys several more DESTROYER DROIDS.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT -SPACE

ANAKIN finds himself in the middle of the space battle. A ship explodes
behind him (over his left shoulder).

ANAKIN : Whoo, boy! This is tense!

He looks forward to see enemy ships approaching head on.

ANAKN : (Cont'd) : Oops! Artoo, get us off Autopilot!

ARTOO screams a reply.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I've got control?

ANAKIN fips switches.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Okay, let's go left!

He moves the controls left and the ship responds, turning left.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Yes...I've got control. You did it, Artoo!

ARTOO beeps

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Go back!?! Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit and
that's what I'm gonna do. Now c'mon!

An enemy fighter comes into his sights. ANAKIN pushes the controls and
instead of firing, his fighter accelerates past the enemy ship.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Oops! Whoa!

Now the enemy ship is on his tail. He tries evasive maneauvers.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'll try spinning, that's a good trick.

ANAKIN rolls the ship as ARTOO screams desperately.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I know we're in trouble! Hang on! The way out of this
mess is the way we got into it.

ARTOO beeps a reply.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Which one? This one?

ANAKIN yanks on the reverse thrusters and the ship slows instantly- the
enemy fighter shoots past and explodes against the space station.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

The SQUADRON attacks the space station.

RIC OLIE : Bravo flight...go for the central bridge.
BRAVO TWO : ROger, Bravo Leader.

The attack is fruitless.

RIC OLIE : Their deflector shield is too strong. We'll never get through
it.

Meanwhile, ANAKIN is being chased by another fighter. ARTOO shrieks.

ANAKIN : I know, Artoo! This isn't Podracing!

The enemy ship fires and hits ANAKIN's fighter, sending it into a spin.
ARTOO screams.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) We're hit!

ANAKIN regains control as his ship enters the space station hanger.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Great gobs of bantha poo-doo!

ANAKIN's ship dodges parked transport ships and other obstacles. A huge
bulkhead blocks his way. ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) I'm trying to stop! I'm trying to stop! Whoa!

ANAKIN hits the reverse thrusters and the ship skids to a stop on the
hanger deck. ARTOO givesout a worried whistle.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) All right! All right! Get the system started!

ANAKIN ducks down to adjust a control panel.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Everything's overheated. All the lights are red.

ARTOO sees DROIDS appraoching, and beeps frantically.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR PIT - DAY

The laser sword battle continues on the small catwalk around the vast power
pit. DARTH MAUL kicks OBI-WAN off one of the ramps and he falls several
levels. QUI-GON knocks the DARK LORD off another ramp, and he lands hard on
a ramp two levels below. QUI-GON jumps down after him. The DARK LORD backs
away along the catwalk into a small door. QUI-GON follows as OBI-WAN runs
to catch up.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR ELECRIC BEAM - HALLWAY

The SITH LORD, followed by QUI-GON, enters a long hallway filled with a
series of deadly rays that go on and off in a pulsing pattern that shoots
down the corridor every minute or so. DARTH MAUL makes it down several
walls of deadly rays before they close. QUI-GON is one wall away from the
DARK LORD. OBI-WAN is just starting into it and is five walls way from
DARTH MAUL.
The JEDI must wait until the next pulse to advance down the corridor.
OBI-WAN is impatient and paces, waiting for the wall of rays to open.
QUI-GON sits and meditates. The SITH LORD tries to patch up his wounds.

INT. THEED - PALACE - HALLWAY TO THRONE ROOM

A window in the hallway blasts apart. PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and HER
SOLDIERS climb into the hallway. They head for the door to the throne roo.
Suddenly, two DESTROYER DROIDS skitter in front of the door. PADME turns
around and sees TWO MORE appear at the far end of the hallway, trapping
them in the middle.
PADME throws down her pistol and turns to CAPTAIN PANAKA.

PADME : Throw down your weapons. They win this round.
CAPT. PANAKA : But we can't....
PADME : Captain, I said throw down your weapons.

CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS MEN throw down their weapons.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

A DESTROYER DROID blasts one of the shield generators, causing it to
EXPLODE. The protective shield begins to weaken and fall apart.OOM-9 sees
the shield weaken and orders his tanks forward. The GUNGAN GENERAL signals
a retreat as the tanks enter the battle.
The GUNGANS flee as fast as they can. JAR JAR is blown off his KAADU and
lands on one of the tank guns. A GUNGAN WARRIOR signals JAR JAR to jump
off. JAR JAR is afraid. The gun swings around trying to knock JAR JAR off.
JAR JAR hangs from the tank barrel as it moves along. Finally, he jumps
onto a KAADU behind a GUNGAN WARRIOR. EXPLOSIONS from the tank fire are
everywhere. It is chaos.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR ELECTRIC BEAM - HALLWAY

The electric rays cycle as QUI-GON sits meditating. The wall of the deadly
rays turn away, and OBI-WAN starts running toward QUI-GON and the DARK
LORD. When the wall between QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL opens, QUI-GON is in a
split second fighting the DARK LORD with a ferocity not seen before. They
move into the area at the end of the corridor called the melting pit, a
small area that is mostly made up of a deep hole.
The electron ray gates begin to close. OBI-WAN tries to make it to the
melting pit but is caught one gate short. He slides to a stop just before
he hits the deadly electron field.
QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL battle around the melting pit as a frustrated
OBI-WAN watches.
DARTH MAUL cathces QUI-GON off guard. The SITH makes a quick move, bashes
his lightsaber handle into QUI-GON's chin, and runs him through. QUI-GON
slumps to the floor in a heap.

EXT. NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

The GUNGANS have beeb overrun. Some flee into the hills, chased by BATTLE
DROIDS on STAPS. Many OTHERS are herded into groups by BATTLE DROIDS and
DESTROYER DROIDS.

JAR JAR : Dissa bad, berry bombad.
GENERAL CEEL : Mesa hopen dissa working for da Queen.

INT. THED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and SIX OTHER OFFICERS are brought by TEN BATTLE
DROIDS before NUTE and RUNE and FOUR NEIMOIDIAN COUNCIL MEMBERS.

NUTE : Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness. Time for you
to sign the treaty...and end this pointless debate in the Senate.

SADBE dressed like the Queen appears in the doorway with SEVERAL TROOPS.
Several destroyed battle droids can be seen in the distance.

SABE : I will not be signing any treaty, Viceroy, because you've lost!

NUTE and THE OTHERS are stunned to see a SECOND QUEEN. NUTE yells at the
TEN GUARDS in the room.

NUTE : After her! This one is a decoy!

SIX OF THE DROIDS rush out of the throne room after SABE. NUTE turns to
PADME.

NUTE : (Cont'd) Your Queen will not get away with this.

PADME slumps down on her throne and immediately hits a security button that
opens a panel in her desk opposite CAPTAIN PANAKA.
PADME grabs two pistols, tosses one of the to CAPTAIN PANAKA and one to an
OFFICER. She takes a third pistol and BLASTS the last of the BATTLE DROIDS.
The OFFICERS rush to the door control panel as PADME hits the switch to
close the door. The OFFICER at the door jams the controls. CAPTAIN PANAKA
throws more pistols to the OTHER GUARDS. The NEIMODIANS are confused and
afraid.

PADME : Now, Viceroy, this is the end of your occupation here.
NUTE : Don't be absurd. There are too few of you. It won't be long before
hundreds of destroyer droids break in to rescue us.

INT. THEED - POWER GENERATOR - MELTING PIT

OBI-WAN screams as the pulsing electron gate opens, and the SITH LORD
attacks him. The DARK LORD is relentless in his assault on the young JEDI.
OBI-WAN and DARTH MAUL use the Force to fling objects at each other as they
fight. DARTH MAUL seems to have the upper hand as OBI-WAN grows weary.
DARTH MAUL catches OBI-WAN off guard, and the JEDI slips into a melting
pit. He is barely able to hold onto a nozzle on the side of the pit. DARTH
MAUL grin evilly at OBI-WAN as he kicks OBI-WAN's lightsaber down the
endless shaft.
The SITH LORD smiles as he goes in for the kill. At the last moment,
OBI-WAN jumps up out of the pit, calls QUI-GON's lightsaber to hi, throwing
DARTH MAUL off. The young JEDI swings with a vengeance, cutting the SITH
down. DARTH MAUL falls into the melting pit to his death.
OBI-WAN rushes over to QUI-GON, who is dying.

OBI-WAN : Master! Master!
QUI-GON : It is too late...It's...
OBI-WAN : No!
QUI-GON : Obi-Wan promise...promise me you'll train the boy...
OBI-WAN : Yes, Master...
QUI-GON : He is the chosen one...he will...bring balance...train him!

QUI-GON dies. OBI-WAN cradles his Master, quietly weeping.

INT. NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - FEDERATION HANGER

ANAKIN peeks over the edge of the cockpit to see BATTLE DROIDS surrounding
the ship. He ducks back down.

ANAKIN : Uh oh. This is not good.

He looks at the dashboard to see red lights.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) The systems are still overheated, Artoo.

The BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN walks up to the ship and sees ARTOO.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : Where's your pilot?

ARTOO beeps a reply.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (Cont'd) You're the pilot?

ARTOO whistles.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (Cont'd) Let me see your identification!

ANAKIN sees the dashboard lights go from red to green.

ANAKIN : Yes...we have ignition.

He flips the switch and the engine starts.

BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN : (seeing Anakin) You! Come out of there or we'll
blast you!
ANAKIN : Not if I can help it! Shields up!

ANAKIN flips a switch and the ship levitates, knocking over the BATTLE
DROID CAPTAIN. The OTHER DROIDS shoot, but the lasers are deflected by
ANAKIN's shields. ARTOO beeeps.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) This should stop them.

ANAKIN fires lasers as the ship begins to rotate.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) ...and take this!

He presses a button and launches two torpedos which miss the DROIDS.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Darn...I missed!

The two torpedos fly down a hallway and explode inside the reactor room.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Let's get out of here!

ANAKIN's ship roars through the hanger deck, bouncing over the DROIDS.

ANAKIN : (Cont'd) Now, this is Podracing! Whoopee!

BRAVO TWO : He flew into the hold, behind the deflector shield and blasted
the main reactor...
BRAVO THREE : Amazing... They don't teach that in the academy.

ANAKIN's ship skids to a stop behind the other Naboo starfighters. RIC
OLIE, BRAVO TWO, the OTHER PILOTS, and GROUND CREW rush to his ship.

RIC OLIE : We're all accounted for. Who flew that ship?

ANAKIN sheepishly opens the cockpit and stands up. All the PILOTS stare in
amazement.

ANAKIN : I'm not going to get into trouble, am I?

ARTOO beeps. oh. oh.

YODA : Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Coucil does. But agree
on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not.
OBI-WAN : Qui-Gon believed in him. I believe in Qui-Gon.
YODA : The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in
his training.
OBI-WAN : Master Yoda, Igave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin. Without
the approval of the Council if I must.

OVER BLACK
We hear labored breathing.

BLACK FRAME
QUOTE APPEARS:

"Revenge is a dish
best served cold"

- Old Klingon Proverb -
QUOTE FADES OUT

WE STAY ON BLACK
...breathing continues...

Then a MAN'S VOICE talks over the breathing;



MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Do you find me sadistic?

CUT TO:

BLACK AND WHITE CU of a WOMAN
lying on the floor, looking up. The woman on the floor has
just taken a severe spaghetti-western-style gang beating. Her
face is bloody, beaten up, and torn. The high contrast B W
turning the red blood into black blood.

A hand belonging to the off-screen Man's Voice ENTERS FRAME
holding a white handkerchief with the name "BILL" sewn in the
corner, and begins tenderly wiping away the blood from the
young woman's face. Little by little as the Male Voice
speaks, the beautiful face underneath is revealed to the
audience.
But what can't be wiped away, is the white hot hate that
shines in both eyes at the man who stands over her, the
"BILL" of the title.

In another    age men who shook the world for their    own purposes
were called    conquerors. In our age, the men who    shake the
planet for    their own power and greed are called    corrupters.
And of the    world's corrupters Bill stands alone.    For while he

corrupts the world, inside himself he is pure.



BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
I bet I could fry an egg on your
head about now, if I wanted to.

He continues wiping away the blood.



BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
No kiddo, I'd like to believe, even
now, you're aware enough to know
there isn't a trace of sadism in
my actions... Okay - Maybe towards
these other jokers - bot not your.

OVERHEAD SHOT
We see for a moment, A WIDE SHOT looking down at the woman on
the floor. Bill (from behind) bent down over her. Four others
in black suits, standing over her (three are female, one is
male). And about four DEAD BODIES lying in their own blood.
We also see we're in a wedding chapel that's been redecorated
by blood death and gunfire. And firstly or lastly, depending
on the viewer, that the woman on the floor is dressed in a
white bridal gown.
This woman is our Heroine, and from this moment forth she
will only be referred to as The BRIDE.

Back to CU of The BRIDE.

The BRIDE on the floor. Her pretty face is wiped clean.



BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
No Kiddo at this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

While still in her CU The Bride speaks for the first time in
the picture. She looks up at the man standing over her and
says;



THE BRIDE
Bill, I'm pregnant. It's your baby.

After saying the "y" in "baby", we hear a BANG and The Bride
receives a bullet in the side of her head.

B W CU of a Young MAN in a TUXEDO. Shot to death.

The BRIDE speaks to us in a VO;



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's Tim, Arthur's best friend.

CU A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN in a frilly pink dress with two
bullet holes in her.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's his girlfriend Janeen.

CU A PLUMP YOUNG WOMAN, shot to death, wedding bouquet still
clutched in her dead fist.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's my best friend from work
Erica.

AN OLDER MAN IN A BLACK SUIT shot fulla holes.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's the minister. I think his
name was Reverend Hillhouse.

A DEAD OLDER WOMAN by his side in an old-fashioned flower
print dress.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's his wife.

A DEAD OLDER WOMAN slumped over an organ.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
Organ player, don't know her name.

A YOUNG MAN IN A TUXEDO WITH HIS FACE BLOWN OFF.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's Arthur. Arthur Plympton. The

name on his driver's license was
Charles Arthur Plympton, but for
some reason he preferred Arthur.
Maybe if he went by Carles people
would have called him Charlie. If
that was his reason for going by
Arthur I can understand it.
Nothing wrong with the name
Charlie, except he didn't look like
a Charlie, he looked like an
Arthur.
Obviously you'll have to take my
word on this. Speaking of names, I
was about two seconds away from
becoming Mrs. Charles Arthur
Plympton.

And then finally, The Bride.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
And that, that's me. I'm the Bride.

We do a DISSOLVE from the Bride looking dead in the bridal
gown

To

The Bride, still in B W, still in a bridal gown, but the
asswippin she took in the scene before must have been in the
past, because she looks like a million dollars
now.......three million even.



INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

The Bride behind the wheel of a Volkswagen Karman Ghia
convertible. Her long blodne hair whipping in the wind. A
PROCESS SHOT PLAYS behind her.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
Looked dead, didn't I? Well I
wasn't, but it wasn'T for lack fo
trying, I can tell you that.
Actually Bill's last bullet put me
in a coma. A coma I was to lie in
for five years.
When I woke up, ...I went on what
the movie advertisements refer to
as a Roaring Rampage of Revenge. I
roarded and I rampaged and I got
bloody satisfaction. In all, I've
killed 33 people to get to this
piont right now.
I have only one more.
The last one.

The one I'M driving to right now.
The only one left.
And when I arrive at my
destination.....
.... I'm gonna Kill Bill.


TITLE SEQUENCE

As a female-sung ballad of heartbreaking lament plays on the
soundtrack, we see the credits of "Kill Bill" play over the
Bride in her bridal gown, driving to the film's climax.

The sequence ends with the Bride arriving at Bill's home.

EX CU The BRIDE's EYEBALL IN GLORIOUS COLOR
WE CUT OUT ONE...TWO...THREE...TO A
CU of The BRIDE IN GLORIOUS COLOR
She's sitting in a parked pickup truck. Her eyes focused on
something.

The BRIDE'S POV:
A very homey three-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of
Pasadena, California. A purple Dodge Neon sits parked in the
driveway. A tricylce, a big wheel, and a few toys sprinkle
the grass on the front yard. A mailbox with the name "The
BELLS" on it sits out in front of the lawn. We hear but don't
see ice cream truck bells.

SUBTITLE APPEARS AT SCREEN BOTTOM:


"The city of
PASADENA, CALIFORNIA"


We hear a Car Door Open and Close....THEN....The Bride Walks
into the shot, heading for the front door.

EX CU: A long, white female finger pushes a doorbell.



EXT. RESIDENTIAL PASADENA STREET - DAY

The front door opens and an attractive black HOUSEWIFE the
same age as The Bride stands in the doorway.
The Housewife's face shows immediate recognition of the
blonde on her doorstep.

The BRIDE
on the porch; we do a quick Shaw-Brothers-style Zoom into her
eyes.

FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE
(That means our Heroine is remembering something, and we see
it with an orange filter.) We're back inside the wedding
chapel. The Bride is taking the beating of her life by four
people in black suits. A black woman PUNCHES HER in the
face... WE see it's the black housewife, five years earlier.

The BRIDE ON THE PORCH
We Zoom quick out of her eyes to CU, a VENGEANCE THEME PLAYS
LOUD ON THE SOUNDTRACK. (Whenever we hear this theme
throughout the picture, we'll quickly learn what accompanies
it is The Bride goin Krakatoa all over whoever's ass happens
to be in front of her at that moment.) As the Vengeance Theme
plays, a Vein in The Bride's forehead begins to pulsate. When
the Vengeance Theme stops, The Bride ATTACKS The Housewife.



INT. HOUSEWIFE'S NICE HOME - DAY

The white woman and the black woman FLY into the center of
the living room, CRASHING onto her coffe table in front of
the sofa.

These two wildcats go at each other savagely, TUMBLING OVER
the couch, clawing and scratching all the way, landing
together on the plush carpet.

The HOUSEWIFE
KICKS The Bride, sending her CRASHING backwards into the
small table where the phone, a note pad (for messages), and
the mail is kept.

The Housewife scrambles up on her feet, but is caught by a
FLYING TACKLE from behind by The Bride that sends them both
into........

An ornamental iron and tempered-glass bookcase that has
framed family photos, display toys, some African art, and a
collection of painted commemorative plates depicting the
negro experience in the American military. Starting with a
plate featuring Cripis Atkins in the revolutionary war, negro
troops in union blue during the civil war, Buffalo soldiers
fighting Indians, the Jim Crow troops of the first world war,
the colored troops of world war two, Korea, Vietnam, and
finally Colin Powell....The Bride and The Housewife CRASH
THROUGH all this reducing everything to rubble.

They land hard on the floor covered in broken glass, locked
in grapple, each trying to get the best of the other one,...
When The Housewife HEADBUTTS The Bride in the nose.

The HOUSEWIFE
hops off The Bride, runs into the kitchen, opens a drawer and
comes out with a HUGE MOTHERFUCKIN BUTCHER KNIFE.

The BRIDE
rises from the floor, and WHIPS OUT a KNIFE in a sheath
hanging from her belt known as a SOG. (A SOG is a long,
double-edged knife that's as sharp as a razor, and is what
Navy Seals use to kill humans with.)

The Bride backs up into the mess of the now totally
demolished living room.

The two    woman stalk each other, each holding her blade, each
looking    like they know how to use it, each waiting for the
other to    make a mistake so they can plunge their blade deep
into the    other one.

Blood and sweat dript off of the faces of the two women
locked in life and death combat......

....When The back kitchen door opens, and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD
LITTLE GIRL, carrying a lunch box steps inside.



FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
Mommy, I'm home!

The two warrior women whose eyes reflect only combat
concentration, suddenly switch upon hearing the four-year
old's voice. The Housewife's eyes flash a look of pleading to
the eyes of The Bride.

The Bride seems to answer back; "Okay."

The Black woman and the white woman hide their edged weapons
behind their backs, as the Four-Year-Old Little Girl walks
into the newly destroyed living room.

The Housewife switches to her mommy voice.



THE HOUSEWIFE
Hey baby, how was school?

The Little Girl is flabbergasted at the mess, and the
condition of her mother, who looks like she's just been in a
bar room brawl.



LITTLE GIRL
Mommy, what happened to you and the
T.V. Room?

THE HOUSEWIFE
Oh, that good for nothin dog of
yours, got his little ass in the
living room and acted a damn fool,
that's what happened.



LITTLE GIRL
Barney did this?

She says it with the slightest hint of skepticism, then tries
to enter the living room.



THE    HOUSEWIFE
Now baby, you    can't come in here,
there's broken    glass all over the
floor, and you    gonna cut yourself.

The little girl's eyes go to the blonde lady in the living
room who she ain't never seen before, who also looks like
she's been fighting.

The Bride smiles at the confused Little Girl.



THE HOUSEWIFE
This is a old friend of mommy's I
ain't seen in a long time.



THE BRIDE
Hello sweety, I'm  (BLEEP) , what's
your name?

  Whenever during the picture somebody says The Bride's real
name, it will be BLEEPED OUT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, ...that is,
till I want you to know.  

The shy, suspicious little girl doesn't say anything, she
just stares at the blond lady.



THE HOUSEWIFE
Her name is Nikki.



THE BRIDE
Nikki. What a pretty name for such
a pretty little girl. How old are
you Nikki?

Nikki still says nothing, only stares.

THE HOUSEWIFE
Nikki,  (BLEEP)  aked you a
question.



NIKKI
(to The Bride)
I'm four.



THE BRIDE
Four years    old, aye. You know I
once had a    little girl. She'd be
five right    now. Maybe you two could
of played    with each other.



THE HOUSEWIFE
Now baby, me an  (BLEEP)  have some
grown-up talk to talk about, so you
go in your room now and leave us
alone till I tell you to come out.

The child doesn't move, so the mother repeats herself.



THE HOUSEWIFE
(snapping her fingers)
Nikkia - in your room - now.

The little girl slowly walks away and disappears behind the
door of her bedroom.

The two women turn to face each other, masquerade and combat
both finished.



THE HOUSEWIFE
Want some coffee?



THE BRIDE
Yeah, sure.

The two women move into the kitchen. The Bride re-sheaths her
SOG, and The Housewife puts the butcher knife back in the
drawer.

The Bride sits down at the kitchen table, while The Housewife
pours both of them coffee.

THE HOUSEWIFE
Cream and sugar?



THE BRIDE
Both, please.

As The Housewife fixes the coffee, we hear The Bride's
VOICEOVER ON THE SOUNDTRACK:



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
This Pasadena homemaker's name is
Jeanne Bell. Her husband is Dr.
Lawrence Bell. But back when we
were acquainted, five years ago,
her name was VERNITA GREEN. Her
code name, was "COBRA"..... Mine
was BLACK MAMBA.

The two combat artists sit at the kitchen table, drinking
coffee out of Vernita's coffee mugs.



THE BRIDE
Were you expecting me?



VERNITA
Yes and no. Bill got in touch with
me right after you woke up, and
then again a little later after
your episode in Japan.
(pause)
So I suppose it's a little late for
a apology, huh?



THE BRIDE
You suppose correctly.



VERNITA
Even if I was sincere?



THE BRIDE
Oh. I'm quite positive you're
sorry, now.

Vernita says to the Bride across the table furiously but with
low volume;

VERNITA
Look bitch, I need to know if
you're gonna start anymore shit
around my baby girl!



THE BRIDE
You can relax for now. I'm not
going to murder you in front of
your daughter.



VERNITA
That's being more rational than
Bill led me to believe you were
capable of.



THE BRIDE
Well that's a demonstration of
Bill's complete ignorance when it
comes to the subject of me, and
what I'm thinking, and what I might
do. It's mercy, compassion, and
forgiveness I lack, not
rationality.

She pauses for effect -- the ham.



THE BRIDE
I'll wait for now, but I won't wait
for long. I'll allow you to choose
a time and place for us to meet
again, preferably as far away from
Nikki as possible.
I could have just HIT you, I
didn't, I demand respect for that.
Since this is not a HIT, consider
it a DUEL. And as two former Deadly
Vipers, we will observe Viper rules
of honor. One on one - no help - no
bushwhackin - no treacherous
weapons - on weapon of choice - our
skill and our bodies.

Vernita says her name;



VERNITA
 (BLEEP) 

THE BRIDE
- I'm not through telling you.
Failure to keep our date, or
duplicity of any kind, will result
in me putting a xoxo hollow point
bullet into the back of your skull
from a window of a building across
the street from Nikki's elementary
school. Now, feel free to respond.



VERNITA
Look...I know I fucked you over. I
fucked you over bad. I wish to God
I hadn't, but I did.

The blonde listens to the black woman with a poker face.



VERNITA
If I could go back in a machine I
would, but I can't. All I can tell
you is I'm a different person now.



THE BRIDE
I don't care.



VERNITA
Be that as it may, I know I do not
deserve mercy or forgiveness.
However, I beseech you for both on
behalf of my daughter.



THE BRIDE
-- Bitch, you can stop right there.

The B-word stops Vernita short, almost like a cold-handed
slap in the face (it should affect the audience that way as
well).



THE BRIDE
(leans in close)
Just because I have no wish to
murder you before the eyes of your
daughter, does not mean parading
her around in front of me is going
to inspire sympathy. You and I have
unfinished business.

And not    a goddamn fuckin thing
you've    done in the subsequent five
years -    including getting knocked
up - is    going to change that.



VERNITA
You have every right to wanna get
even --



THE BRIDE
-- But that's where you're wrong,
Vernita. I don't want to get even.
To get even, even Steven. I would
have to kill you, go into Nikki's
room, kill her, then wait for your
old man, Dr. Bell, to come home and
kill him. That would make us even.
No, my unborn daughter will just
hafta be satisfied with your death
at her mother's hands.

Vernita knows no matter what else is said, blood will spill.



VERNITA
When do we do this?



THE BRIDE
It all depends... When do you want
to die? Tomorrow? The day after
tomorrow? That's about as long as
I'll wait.



VERNITA
How bout tonight, bitch?



THE BRIDE
Spendid. Where?



VERNITA
There's a baseball diamond where
our little league has its games,
about a mile from here. We meet
there around two-thirty in the
morning, dressed all in black, your
hair in a black stocking, and we
have us a knife fight, we won't be

bothered. I have to fix Nikki's
cereal.

As they continue to talk, Vernita pulls down a cereal bowl
for her daughter and lays it on the kitchen counter.



THE BRIDE
Bill said you were one of the best
ladies he'd ever seen with an edged
weapon.

Vernita moves to another kitchen cabinet, and pulls down a
box of the sugar cereal, "Kaboom."



VERNITA
Fuck you, bitch, I know he didn't
qualify it, so you can just kiss my
motherfuckin ass, Black Mamba.
(snorts to herself)
Black Mamba, I shoulda been
motherfuckin Black Mamba.

As the two females continue to talk, Vernita reaches her hand
inside the cereal box.



THE BRIDE
Weapon of choice? And if you want
to stick with your butcher knife,
I'm cool with that.



VERNITA
Very funny.

Vernita FIRES A GUN from inside the cereal box at The
Bride....

.... The bullet explodes out of the cardboard box, and HITS
the coffee mugh directly in front of The Bride, BLOWING IT TO
SMITHEREENS.

The Bride THROWS HERSELF ON THE FLOOR....

Vernita pulls the gun out of the cereal box and FIREES
again...

...The bullet HITS THE FLOOR of the tiny kitchen...

...The Bride moves under the kitchen table, then using her
back, LIFTS THE TABLE OFF THE GROUND, RAMMING IT STRAIGHT
INTO Vernita, pinning her flat up against the table top, and
the kitchen counter.

While her left hand holds the table,    her right hand goes to
the SOG on her belt, her fingers wrap    around the blade's
grip, lifting it up out of the sheath    and PLUNGING IT THROUGH
THE TABLE TOP up to the handle, with    all the SOG's steel
entering Vernita's abdomen.

The table falls back to the floor with the dying homemaker
pinned to it. The two former colleagues meet eyes.



VERNITA
Sorry, bout the bushwhack. Please
don't...



THE BRIDE
Do to your daughter, what you did
to mine...
(she takes her hand)
...I won't.

Vernita dies.

The Bride removes her Sog, looks up and sees little Nikki
standing in the doorway of her room. The little girl sees her
mother dead on the floor, lying in her own blood. And she
sees the blonde lady standing over her mother, bloody knife
still in her hand. But oddly enough, Nikki doesn't cry. The
little girl locks eyes with the big girl, and holds her
stare.

As she    talks to the little girl, she removes an already
stained    with blood white handkerchief with the name "BILL"
sewn on    it. And the blonde wipes the girl's mother's blood
off her    blade.



THE BRIDE
It was not my intention to do this
in front of you. For that I'm
sorry. But you can take my word for
it, your mother had it coming. When
you grow up, if you still feel raw
about it, I'll be waiting.

And with that apology, statement, and invitation, The Bride
walks out the kitchen side door, leaving the little girl to
her mourning.



EXT. VERNITA'S HOME - DAY

The Bride walks down the dead woman's driveway to her
vehicle. She glances at the lawn toys one more time as she
makes here getaway.

She climbs into her big, yellow pickup truck, with the words
"Pussy Wagon" written across the flatbed's hatch door in a
pimpy font. She takes out a ringed notebook and turns to a
page that's headline reads;


DEATH LIST FIVE

On the pager are five names numbered going down the page
written in red ink.

The first name has a line drawn through it with black ink.

The second name on the list is;


VERNITA GREEN
COBRA

The Bride takes a black felt pen and draws a line through
Vernita's name. Turns on the truck's engine and drives out of
the residential district.

EX CU ELLE DRIVER'S EYE AND WHITE EYE PATCH
looking down at her sleeping target, victim, rival, and

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYES
wide open - blank stare.

Elle standing over The Bride's hospital bed, says to her;



ELLE
I might never of liked you. Point
in fact I despise you. But that
doesn't suggest I don't respect
you. You were a master of a
profession that's most difficult to
master.
Dying in our sleep is a luxury our
kind is rarely afforded. My gift to
you.

As she lifts the syringe off the tray....

Her cell phone RINGS....

She curses to herself...there can be only one person on the
other end....she answers it.



ELLE
Hello, Bill.
(pause)
Affirmative.
(pause)
Comatose.
(pause)
I'm standing over her right now.
(pause)
What!

The female assassin turns away from the wide-eyed stare of
The Bride, and paces the hospital room talking in the cell
phone.



ELLE
Don't fuckin ssshhh me! If you
think I came all the way down to
Texas - in a dog and cat rainstorm
no less - just to tuck sleeping
beauty in bed - you got another
fuckin thing comin -
(pause, then real loud)
You don't owe her Shit!!
(then again, but quieter)
You don't owe her shit.
(pause)
Man, fuck that bitch!
(pause)
Oh you're not are you? Well Bill,
you never leave a job half done.
A great teacher taught me that
once, he looked a whole lot like

you.

Elle pauses as Bill on the other line has his say. We don't
hear his side, we stay with Elle as he talks. We can tell by
her face, he's making some sense. After awhile she answers
back;



ELLE
I guess.
(pause)
No, I don't need to guess, I know.
(pause)
Affirmative.
(pause)
I love you too, bye bye.

The female assassin puts the phone away and looks down at The
comatose Bride with the open eyes. Even though her face is
expressionless, she almost seems to be smiling.



ELLE
Thought that was pretty funny
didn't ya? Word of advice shithead,
don't you ever wake up.

Elle leans closer to the Bride's face.



ELLE
Ya know now I get a better look at
you, you're not so damn pretty.
Yeah, you go that Venus thing going
for you but...ya know, now I get a
closer look at you you're kinda
weird looking. You got this big
nose that doesn't fit with the rest
of your face, your eyes are two
different sizes. And look at your
skin...My complexion is way better
than yours --

The Bride does one of her motor reflex functions...She SPITS
in Elle's face.

Elle springs up, wipes the spit off her cheek and looks down
at The comatose Bride in her bed.



ELLE
Oh, no you didn't.

She grabs The Bride by the front of her hospital gown...

....Yanks Her up to a sitting position...

...And PUNCHES her hard in the face three times.

BANK still echoing in her ears. She lets out a SCREAM OF PAIN
and her hand goes to the side of her head, as if she were
just shot.

Her hand feels the metal plate embedded in the side of her
skull where the hole was. She knocks against it with her
knuckle...it goes...TINK...TINK.

Suddenly she says out loud;



THE BRIDE
My baby.

Her hand goes down to her belly, unly to find it not swollen
but flat. She doesn't understand, lifts up her hospital gown
and sees a JAGGED SCAR which runs down her abdomen. Her
fingertips trace it.

She quickly looks at the palm of her and and counts the

with Orderly's sneakers.

CAMERA MOVES UP TO
Orderly's face, leading
two TRUCKDRIVERS.
The Bride HEARS BILL'S
VOICE SPEAK FOR THE ORDERLY;


BILL'S VOICE                            ORDERLY
(in time)                              (in time)
She's right in here.                She's right in here.


SPLIT SCREEN FINISHES
STAY WITH The BRIDE'S SCREEN

The Bride decides the best course    of action,    till she gets
her bearings, is to play possum.    She throws    herself back down
on the bed, just as the three men    enter her    room.
They see just what they expected    to see, The    Bride lying in
her bed in her coma.

She duplicates her comatose eyes-wide-open-fixed stare.
Except knowing she's awake, and sees everything in front of
her, creates a slightly different effect.

The Bride, however, while she sees the Two Truckdrivers for
what they are, when she sees The Orderly she sees Bill, when
The Orderly talks she hears Bill. WE HOWEVER WILL NEVER SEE
BILL'S FACE COMPLETELY.

The Orderly takes her shee covering off, and hitches up her
hospital gown till her blonde pussy is exposed. He does kind
of a "TA-DA" presentation of her vagina.



THE ORDERLY
Now is that the cutest little
blonde pussy you ever saw, or is
that the cutest little blonde
pussy, YOU-EVEA-SAW?

Trucker  2 (Gerald) would tend to agree, Trucker  1 (Warren)
fronts.



WARREN
I seen better.

CU The BRIDE
EYES WIDE OPEN PLAYING POSSUM. She can't believe she's being
exhibited in this manner. A look of chagrin crosses her
trying-to-be expressionless face, "I've seen a fuck load
better than you, fatass."



THE ORDERLY
Yeah, in a movie - maybe. But I
know damn well this is the best
pussy you ever saw you had touchin
rights to. The price is seventy
five dollars a fuck gentlemen, you
gittin your freak on or what?

The Truckers pay the bill of fare.

As The Orderly counts The Truckers' money, he lays out the
rules;



THE ORDERLY
Here's the rules; Rule    number one;
no punchin 'er.
Nurse comes in tomorrow    an she got
'er a shiner - or less    some teeth,
jig's up. So no knuckle    sandwiches
under no circumstances.    And by the

way, this little cunt's a spitter -
it's a motor reflex thing but spit
or no, no punchin. Now are we
absolutely positively clear about
rule number one?



TWO TRUCKERS
Yeah.



THE ORDERLY
Rule number two;
No monkey bites, no hickeys - in
fact no leavin no marks of no kind.
But after that, it's allll goooood.
Her plummin down there don't work
no more, so feel free to cum in 'er
all ya wont. Keep the noise down -
try not to make a mess, and I'll be
back in twenty.

The Orderly turns to leave, then remembers something, and
turns back. He takes out the most disgusting jar of vaseline
in the history of cinema, and hands it to Warren.



THE ORDERLY
Oh by the way, not all the time,
but sometimes this cunt's cunt can
get drier than a bucket of sand.
If she dry, lube up with this and
you'll be goo to go. BON-APPETIT,
gentlemen.

And with that, The Orderly's gone.

The BRIDE'S POV:
As soon as he leaves the Two Truckers start giggling. Warren
begins to unbuckle the belt that lies beneath his belly.
While he looks down to accomplish this, The BRIDE'S POV
BLINKS.



GERALD
Hey Warren, she just blinked.



WARREN
He said she can't blink.



GERALD
I know what he said, I'm tellin ya

she just did.

Warren drops his Levi's to his ankles.



WARREN
Just wait, when I get through with
this little dumbbell, she gonna
stand up and recite the Gettysburg
Ad-dress.

Warren begins to climb up on the bed and mount The Bride.
Before he does he stops, and looks back to Gerald.



WARREN
Hey, Gerald.



GERALD
Yeah?



WARREN
This shit ain't no peep show. Go
out in the hall and I'll let ya
know when it's your turn.



GERALD
Awww c'mon, I gotta leave the room?



WARREN
I can't get no errection wit you
lookin at me, so go on.



GERALD
Well, just hurry up then.

Gerald leaves the room; we go out with him in the hallway.



INT. HALLWAY (HOSPITAL) - NIGHT

Gerald paces, waiting for his turn behind the door.

THEN...

He hears behind the door a commotion, then Warren SCREAM LIKE
A BITCH. He bangs on the closed door and says;

GERALD
He man, keep it down in there, I
can hear your ass out here.

More falsetto SCREAMS behind the door...

THEN...

The HEAVY THUD of a body falling. Not what the expected.



INT. THE BRIDE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Gerald pushes open the door to see one hellva sight. His
buddy, bloody and lying motionless on the floor, and The
Bride lying haphazardly on the bed, in her coma.

He moves to his buddy, who's dead. Then moves to The comatose
Bride... Who SUDDENLY SPRINGS TO LIFE, GRABBING him by the
front of his shirt, YANKING HIM DOWN TO HER, and PLUNGING the
I.V. NEEDLE in her arm DEEP INTO HIS TEMPLE, THEN TWISTING IT
AROUND and AROUND, turning the right side of his brain into
scrambled eggs a la The BRIDE.
She tosses the now brain-dead Gerald to the floor.

The BRIDE
upon waking, without leaving the bed    where she lay the last
five years, has just killed two men.    She throws off the
bloody blankets, whips her legs off    the side of the bed, and
tries to stand - THEN QUICKLY FALLS    OUT OF FRAME. WE HEAR THE
CRASH BELOW FRAME.

The Bride is flat on the floor. Her legs and feet don't work.
Which means she's stuck on the floor with only a functioning
top half, and a completely useless bottom half. What's a girl
to do?



INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The elevator doors open, and The Orderly steps out.

BACK TO The BRIDE
She hears the sound of Bill's boots approaching the room...
STEP...STEP...STEP...

She sees Gerald has a Trucker's knife in a holster attached
to his belt. Her hands removes it.

The Orderly swaggers down the hall to The Bride's room, red
Reeboks slapping against the smooth floor.

CU The BRIDE
She SNAPS the knife's BLADE OPEN in her CU.

The Orderly pushes open The Bride's door, stopping in shock.

The ORDERLY'S POV:
He sees an empty bed with bloodstains on it, Two dead
Truckers on the floor, and no Bride.



ORDERLY
Oh shit!

WE GO TO SLOW MOTION    as he freaks, Then PAN DOWN HIM... Past
shirts - pants - to    his Reeboks...Once on the floor WE SEE
The BRIDE, curled up    low next to the doorway, behind his
ankles, knife ready.    WE GO BACK TO 24 FRAMES A SECOND. He
steps into the room;    when he does The Bride reaches out and
SLASHES both of his    Achilles tendons.

The STANDING ORDERLY
lets out a "YELP," adn FALLS OUT OF FRAME.

IMPACT CUT
The Orderly HITTING the floor face first. The boy is stunned.

The BRIDE (Confined to the floor)
crawls over and drags the stunned fucker across the floor,
placing his melon head between the door and the door frame.
Then taking the door in her right hand.

SLAM!

SLAM!

SLAM!

SLAMMING HIS HEAD THREE TIMES BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE DOOR
FRAME.

The ORDERLY
lies on the floor in a stange state of consciousness. He's in
both excruciating pain, and quite sure he's lost his mind,
since at this moment he's lying on the floor, looking up at
The comatose Bride asking him questions.



THE BRIDE
Where's Bill?



THE ORDERLY
(hurt and confused)
Who?

SLAM!

He screams.

THE BRIDE
Bill! Where is Bill!



THE ORDERLY
I dunno no Bill.

SLAM!



THE BRIDE
I saw him here myself.....
SLAM!
....Now do you tell me where he is,
or do I beat your fuckin brains in?

SLAM!



THE ORDERLY
Please please stop, don't hit me
again!



THE BRIDE
Where is Bill?

SLAM!

Suddenly The Bride sees the gold coke straw around his neck,
that she thought she'd seen earlier on Bill. She snatches it
from around his neck.



THE BRIDE
Where did you get this from?



THE ORDERLY
That's mine.

SLAM!



THE BRIDE
Bullshit! I saw Bill wearing it in
this room ten minutes ago.

SLAM!

Then The Bride looks down and sees two tatoos on the
Orderly's hand - one spelling "B.U.C.K." on each finger of

his left hand. And another spelling "F.U.C.K." on the fingers
of his right.

The Bride seems to look inside her own mind - Whenever she
does this A SPECIAL THEME MUSIC WILL PLAY (We'll call it her
REMEMBERING THEME).

WE DO A    QUICK SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM INTO HER EYES -
We see    Buck enter her room that first night, five years
ago....    He's holding in his hand one of those big flashlights
you use    in a tent when camping. -- It gives off a soft blue
light.    Buck examines The Bride through the blue.



BUCK
Well, ain't you the slice of cutie
pie they all said you wuz. Well
Ma'am, I'm from Longview Texas, my
name's Buck, and I'm here to fuck.

He starts to unbuckle his belt.

WE ZOOM OUT OF HER EYES INTO A CU. The REMEMBERING THEME CUTS
OFF. She looks down at Buck and says;



THE BRIDE
Your name's Buck, right? And you
came to fuck, right?

A "how the fuck does she know look," crosses his face.

The Bride looks down at him....The VENGEANCE THEME BEGINS
PLAYING LOUDLY ON The SOUNDTRACK, and the VEIN IN HER
FOREHEAD BECOMES PRONOUNCED and begins to PULSATE IN TIME
WITH The MUSIC. Every time The Bride comes face to face with
a tormenter, this Theme will play on the soundtrack. By mid
movie this music should drive the audience wild with orgasmic
anticipation of the carnage to come...

...and With the door in her hand and one mighty slam, this
Longview Texas boy is sent to the Promised Land.

She searches the dead man's    pockets,    coming up with a brown
wallet that says on it, "BIG    EL PASO    PIMPIN," loaded with
lettuce. She also pulls out    a set of    car keys on a pickup
truck key chain that has the    words,    "Pussy Wagon" on it
written in a pimpy font. She    gathers    up all these items, and
Gerald's knife, then begins    to strip    Buck of his orderly
uniform.



INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The elevator doors to the hospital's underground parking lot
open, revealing The Bride in Buck's orderly scrubs in a
wheelchair.

She wheels out of the elevator fast into the parking lot. Her
arms spinning the wheels as she goes down the line of cars,
looking for a pickup truck that Buck would own...she stops.

What made The Bride stop. The ass end of a big, yellow 4x4
hard-body pickup truck, with flames painted along the side,
and the words, "PUSSY WAGON," written along the flat-bed
hatch door. Pimpy font.

The Bride looks at Buck's key chain in her hand.

EX CU CAR KEY in truck door lock, it turns.

EX CU TRUCK DOOR LOCK POPS UP OPEN.



INT. BACKSEAT OF BUCK'S TRUCK - NIGHT

The Bride pulls herself up into the backseat of Buck's pickup
truck. Once in the backseat, she shoves the wheelchair away.

It rolls out of control down the parking ramp, and CRASHES.

Now The Bride's lying vertically in    Buck's truck's backseat.
Seemingly out of danger - at least    out of sight - but she's
still stuck hiding in the hospital.    And until she regains
full use of her legs and feet, this    little Bride ain't goin
anywhere or doin anything.

Lying flat, with the back of her head propped up against the
door, her long, lifeless legs stretched out in front of her,
her two bare feet at the end of them, pointing to the sky,
the Bride focusses her eyes, her stare, her thoughts, her
strength, and all her concentration....on her big toe.

SLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO HER FACE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO BIG TOE....

SLOW ZOOM INTO FACE.



THE BRIDE
(monotone)
Wiggle your big toe.

Toe doesn't move an inch.



THE BRIDE
Wiggle your big toe.

It doesn't move.

THE BRIDE
Wiggle your big toe.
(VOICE OVER)
As I lay in the back of Buck's
pickup truck, trying to will my
limbs out of entropy, I could see
the faces of the cunts who did this
to me, and the dick responsible.
Members all of Bill's brainchild;
"The Deadly Viper Assassination
Squad."

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
Now after five years of beauty
sleep I knew absolutely nothing
about my enemies' strengths
weakness or whereabouts. But as
fated by God vengeance would have
it, I who knew nothing - knew one
thing. As sure as God made little
green apples...

WE MOVE FAST TO O-REN ISHII'S SILHOUETTE, The SILHOUETTE
BECOMES A POSED PICTURE OF O-REN in all her Deadly Viper
glory.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
(continued)
....if O-Ren Ishii, the first name
on my Death List, was still
alive... she'd live in Japan. O-Ren
Ishii, made her first acquaintance
with death at the age of eleven.

FLASH ON
CU O-REN (11-years old), hiding under a bed, watching...

...her FATHER (dressed in the uniform of a sergeant for the
American Army) fighting THREE YAKUZA GANGSTERS. He kills one
with his bare hands. The other two slice him to death with
samurai swords...

...and her MOTHER being raped by the same men. When they
finish, they SHOOT her.

Little O-Ren watches, hidden from sight, withi the eyes and
face of a stone.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
It was at that age, a half-Chinese,
half-Japanese American Army brat
witnessed the murder of her Master
Sergeant father. And the rape, then
murder of her mother at the hands
of Japan's most ruthless Yakuza
boss, Boss Matsumoto. She swore
revenge...luckily for her, Boss
Matsumoto was a pedophile.

SHOCK CUT
O-REN ON TOP OF BOSS MATSUMOTO PLUNGING A HUGE KNIFE INTO HIS
CHEST. A STREAM OF RED BLOOD SHOOTS UP OUT OF HIM like a
geyser. Boss is naked, O-Ren wears a Japanese schoolgirl
uniform.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
At thirteen, she got her revenge.

The Boss's screams cause TWO OF BOSS'S MEN to run into the
room, only to be SHOT DOWN by O-Ren, as she removes a gun
from a holster strapped to her thigh.

The 20-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII
on a rooftop with a high-powered, scope-sight rifle up to her

She fires.

front; one reads, "Miss Panama," the other    reads, "Miss
Venezuela." As we cut to this shot, he has    both hands on each
of their bare knees. He's laughing as the    TOP OF HIS HEAD is
BLOWN OFF.

The 23-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII
stands before Bill and The Bride. (Bill is not clearly

stepping down INTO The SHOT.

She walks around to the driver's side and climbs in.

She sticks Buck's ignition key in its slot and turns.

The truck's engine RUMBLES to life.

She spies a pair of Elvis T.C.B. SUNGLASSES lying on the

Then slips on the cowboy boots.

Chooses another TOP.

And finds a warm JACKET.

She opens Buck's "BIG EL PASO PIMPIN" wallet, and pays for
the items.

She emerges from the store wearing her new outfit, and climbs
back in the truck.

She drives, stopping at a DEPARTMENT STORE, and walking
inside.

She picks up a SHOVEL, a HAND PICKAXE, a big CAMPING
FLASHLIGHT, a MAP OF TEXAS, a writing NOTEBOOK, and a bunch

of RED and BLACK FELT PENS.

of her.

She cries for her baby...

She cries for the motherhood robbed from her...

She cries for all the innocent people at the wedding chapel,
who died simply because they were unlucky enough to cross her
path...

She cries for the betrayal at the hands of her lover...

She cries for the treachery at the hands of her comrades...

She cries for the five years of life snatched from her...

She cries for the countless violations she endured while
incapacitated...

And finally, she cries for all the misery she will cause the
undeserving......enroute to Bill's retribution. Retribution
that begins the minute she steps out of this bathtub.

She curls up into a fetal position inside the tub of warm
water...weeping.

We DOLLY back...to give our heroine some privacy...WE
DISSOLVE through the bathroom door...Till we're on the other
side, filming a closed door with crying on the other side.

When she's finished shedding tears, is when she'll begin
shedding blood.

When the bathroom door opens, the woman that emerges, has
closed out all of her emotions...save from one...revenge.

It's that woman, in her new outfit, that climbs into the
yellow pussy wagon, puts the T.C.B. Sunglasses over her eyes,
and starts the engine that sets into motion the gory story to
follow.

EXT. INT. BUCK'S TRUCK DRIVING IN DESERT (MOVING) - NIGHT

POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD:
The truck shines its headlight beams on an open patch of
prairie wasteland. We see dirt, rocks, plants, and an oil
derrick pumping up and down.

The Bride STOPS the truck.

Taking her flashlight with her, The Bride walks into the
headlight beams towards one rock on the ground in particular.

She lifts it off the ground, there's an X on it's underside.

She    smiles.    If the X hadn't been there, she would have taken
it    as a sign    that her vengeance quest was never meant to be.
But    as it is    there, it would appear that fortune has smiled
on    The Bride    and her bloody intentions.

She walks back to the truck, takes the shovel and the hand
pickaxe out from the flatbed, reaches into the truck cab and
CHANGES THE MUSIC TO A POUNDING HEAVY METAL ANTHEM.

CU The BRIDE'S COWBOY BOOTS
next to the X ROCK
IN TIME WITH The METAL, The Bride's cowboy boots count out
ten paces from the rock.
When the boots stop, the flashlight ENTERS THE SHOT
illuminating the spot, THEN...the shovel ENTERS, striking
deep in the unmarked earth.



EXT. TEXAS DESERT - NIGHT

Deep in the middle of Fuck-Knows Texas, lit by the headlights
of Buck's 4x4, The Bride digs a hole in the
ground......TILL...

She HITS SOMETHING HARD.

She gets down on her knees, hacking away at the dirt with the
hand pickaxe, till a large box covered in plastic is
revealed. She hoists it up out of the earth.

She rips off the plastic, revealing a large, green Army
footlocker, untouched by the condensation of being buried in
the ground for over five years. Flipping the two locks open,
she lifts the lid, placing the big camping flashlight on the
rim.

Unfolding a sleeping bag long-ways, she bought at the
department store. The Bride begins collecting the contents of
her buried treasure, and laying them on the sleeping bag.

We see her remove them from the footlocker, one by one.

The HEAVY METAL CONTINUES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

back in the envelope.

1 CLEAR ZIP-LOCK BAG containing a PHONY I.D. and BANK BOOK
both w  the name "CANDY RALSTON" on them. Reaching back in

FADE UP ON



INT. SUSHI BAR (OKINAWA, JAPAN) - DAY

The ENTRANCE to a tiny sushi bar, covered by a Japanese
curtain....

SUBTITLE APPEARS:


"The City of
OKINAWA, JAPAN"

....The fabric is moved aside, and The Bride enters the shot,
and the tiny establishment.

The little fish and sake bar is the definition of the word
cozy. Besides The Bride, the only other person inside is The
SUSHI CHEF, who smiles at her behind the midget bar.

This Japanese man in his mid-fifties greets the tall, blonde
western girl with a turned-on-for-the-tourists affability.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
English?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Almost -- American.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

Ahhhh,...America, welcome...
Welcome... My English -- Very good.

The Bride smiles at this and walks further inside. She
doesn't come across as one of the world's deadliest
assassins, but instead as a sweet, slightly airheaded,
American tourist.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Domo.

The Sushi Chef gives an exaggerated look of surprise, and
says;



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Oh, "Domo", Very good -- very good,
you speak Japanese?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Nooo, just a few words I learned
since yesterday. - May I sit at the
bar?



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Sure sure sure - sit. What other
words did you learn - excuse me --

The Sushi Chef YELLS IN JAPANESE, to someone OFFSCREEN.

The Bride thinks the restaurant so small it's almost hard to
imagine there could be a back room to it.

Before getting a response from whoever it was he was yelling
to a moment ago, The Sushi Chef turns back to The Bride.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
-- What other Japanese you learn?

The Bride puts on a thinking face.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Oh...let's see..."Arigato."



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
"Arigato"...Very good.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
..."Ah-So"...



SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
"Ah-So!" You know what "Ah-So"
means 



THE BRIDE
"I See."



SUSHI CHEF
I see - Very good.



THE BRIDE
I already said "Domo", right?



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Yes.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
"Kon-netie-wa."

The Sushi Chef goes "Oooh" like he's just discovered the
answer to a mystery.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
..."Kon-nichi-wa"...repeat please.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
"Kon-nichi-wa?"

Saying with surprise and admiration;



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Most impressive...you say Japanese
words, like you Japanese.

The Bride smiles and lets loose with a girlish giggle.

THE BRIDE
Now you're making fun of me.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
No no no - serious business.
Pronunciation - very good. You say
"Arigato" ...like we say "Arigato."



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Well, thank you - I mean...arigato.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
You should learn Japanese - very
easy.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
No kidding, I heard it's kinda
hard.

Whenever the Sushi Chef doesn't either hear your or
understand you, he yells the word;



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
What!

And everybody always speaks LOUDER and CLEARER immediately
afterwards.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
I always heard it was difficult.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Yes yes yes - most difficult. But
you have Japanese tongue.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Maybe I was Japanese in another
life.

The Sushi Chef proclaims as if he should know;

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Most definitely, most definitely
Japanese in another life.

He sets an order of colorful, raw fish in front of the young
blonde woman, that not only looks good, it looks beautiful.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
How did you know tuna's my
favorite?



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
What!



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Tuna's my favorite.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Ah, thank you very much.

He YELLS    OFFSCREEN in Japanese agai. A little BALD JAPANESE
MAN with    a shitty attitude, comes out from the back room. He
heads for    the tall blonde asking in a grumbly voice in
Japanese,    "What she wants to drink?"



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
(to the bald man)
I beg your pardon?

The Sushi Chef pantomimes drinking.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
- Drink -



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Oh yes, a bottle of warm sake.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Ahhh sake,
(he holds up his thumb)
Very good.

In Japanese he YELLS ORDERS the warm sake, the little Bald
Man disappears. The Bride takes a bite out of her fish.

SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
First time in Japan?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
A-huh.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
What!



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Yes, this is my first time.

As the chef slices the next portion with a large knife, he
asks;



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
What brings you to Okinawa?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
I came to see a man.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Aaahh, you have friend live in
Okinawa?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Not quite.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
Not friend?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
I've never met him.

The Sushi Chef continues slicing.....



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)

Who is he, may I ask?



THE BRIDE
Hattori Hanzo.

There's a break in the Sushi Chef's slicing. After a beat, he
brings a bloody finger INTO FRAME and sticks it in his mouth.

The little Bald man appears with a bottle of warm sake, he
pours one for The Bride, then disappears again.

As The Bride sips the sake, she looks at the chef.

As The Sushi Chef sucks his finger, he looks at The Bride.

The Sushi Chef drops the voice he had been using up to that
point...and IN JAPANESE SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH asks;



SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
What do you want with Hattori
Hanzo?

The Bride answers in Japanese;



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I need Japanese steel.



SUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE)
Why do you need Japanese steel?



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I have vermin to kill.



SUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH)
You must have big rats you need
Hattori Hanzo steel.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Huge.



INT. HATTORI HANZO'S ATTIC - DAY

The trap door in the floor opens up, and HATTORI HANZO (Sushi
Chef), climbs inside the room, followed by The Bride.

The room has many handcrafted samurai swords in hand-carved
wooden sheaths resting on wooden racks running the length of
the second half of the attic.

The Bride walks down the row of Japanese steel, looking and
touching the shiny wood. She looks behind her to Hanzo who is
still by the trap door, and says;



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
May I?

The Sushi Chef answers in ENGLISH;



HANZO (ENGLISH)
Yes you may.....

She starts reaching for one...



HANZO (ENGLISH)
...try the second one down in the
sixth row on your left.

She finds it lying sleeping in its shiny, black sheath.

Her hand lifts it from the rack.

She UNSHEATHS the steel, partially....then with GREAT
FLOURISH....completely.

Hanzo's mouth froms a smile.



HANZO (ENGLISH)
Funny, you like samurai swords...

He pulls a baseball out of his pocket.



HANZO (ENGLISH)
...I like baseball.

THEN SUDDENLY - HE THROWS THE BASEBALL HARD, right at The
Bride's head....

QUICK AS A WHIP, SHE SLICES THE BALL IN HALF, IN MID AIR.

The two perfectly cut baseball pieces, hit the floor.

He gives her a slight nod, then crosses the attic towards
her.

HANZO (JAPANESE)
I wanted to show you these....
However someone as you, who knows
so much must surely know, I no
longer make instruments of death. I
keep these here for their ascetic
and sentimental value.
(he takes both sword and
sheath from her...)
Yet proud tho I am of my life's
work...
(...he closes them
together)
I am retired.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Then give me one of these.



HANZO (ENGLISH)
These are not for sale.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
I didn't say, sell me. I said, give
me.



HANZO (ENGLISH)
And why should I be obliged to
assist you in the extermination of
your vermin?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Because my vermin, is a former
student of yours. And considering
the student, I'd say you had a
rather large obligation.

Hattori Hanzo goes to a dusty window, and writes the name,
"BILL" on it with his finger.

The blonde girl nods her head yes.

The proud warrior moves over to the door in the floor,
throwing it open.

He points into a corner...

HANZO (JAPANESE)
...You can sleep there...

.....starts to descend....



HANZO (JAPANESE)
...it will take me a week to make
the sword...

.....before his head disappears, he says;



HANZO (JAPANESE)
...I suggest you spend it
practicing.

...he closes the door behind him.

She smiles slightly...then moves over to the window, takes
out a handkerchief, and wipes Bill's name off.

FADE TO BLACK.



OVER BLACK
TITLE APPEARS:


"One week later"

Under black we hear Hattori Hanzo's voice in Japanese and
read the subtitles;



HANZO (V.O.; JAPANESE)
I'm done doing what I swore an oath
to God 28 years ago to never do
again. I've created, "something
that kills people." And in that
purpose I was a success.

FADE UP ON



CU HATTORI HANZO



HANZO (JAPANESE)
I've done this, because
philosophically I'm sympathetic to
your aim.

EX CU The HANZO SWORD

TRACKING EX CU of the Hanzo sword in its shiny, black wood
sheath. At the base of the sheath, by the handle, he's carved
the face of a lioness...



HANZO (V.O.; JAPANESE)
I can tell you with no ego, this is
my finest sword. If on your
journey, you should encounter God,
God will be cut.

CU HANZO.



HANZO (JAPANESE)
Revenge is never a straight line.
It's a forest. And like a forest
it's easy to lose your way...to get
lost...
to forget where you came in. To
serve as a compass, a combat
philosophy must be adopted that can
be found in the secret doctrine of
the Yagu Ninja. And now my yellow
haired warrior, repeat after me;

We go back and forth between CU of HANZO reciting the
doctrine like a samurai drill instructor and the Bride
repeating it.



HANZO (JAPANESE)
"When engaged in combat, the
vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the warrior's only concern...

The Bride repeats this...



HANZO (JAPANESE)
...This is the first and cardinal
rule of combat...

The Bride repeats this...



HANZO (JAPANESE)
...Suppress all human emotion and
compassion...

The Bride repeats this...



HANZO (JAPANESE)

...Kill whoever stands in thy way,
even if that be Lord God, or Buddha
himself...

The Bride repeats this...



HANZO (JAPANESE)
This truth lies at the heart of the
art of combat. Once it is
mastered... Thou shall fear no
one... Though the devil himself may
bar thy way...

The Bride repeats this... Her eyes look at the greatest maker
of swords on this earth and says;



THE BRIDE
Domo.

EX CU The Hanzo Sword,
her white hand with her long fingers COMES INTO FRAME and
removes the beautiful, artful instrument of vengeance.

FADE TO BLACK.

Chapter Four

SHOWDOWN
at
HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES


CUT TO:

A BLANK PIECE    OF DRAWING PAPER
A hand comes    in and, as the Bride talks over this image,
draws with a    piece of charcoal, a portrait of the geisha
regaled O-REN    ISHII.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
When fortune smiles on something as
violent and ugly as revenge, at the
time it seems proof like no other,
that not only does God exist,
you're doing his will. At a time
when I knew the last about my
enemies, the first name on my death
list, was the easiest to find. But

of course,    when one manages the
difficult    task of becoming queen of
the Tokyo    underworld, one doesn't
keep it a    secret, does one?

The charcoal drawing gets color and becomes ANIMATED, turning
into a JAPAMATION O-REN...

JAPANESE ANIMATION SEQUENCE
We see Japamation-style images of The Bride's verbiage.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
At the age of twenty, Bill backed
his Nippon progeny financially and
philosophically in her
Shakespearian-in-magnitude power
struggle with the other Yakuza
clans, over who would rule vice in
the city of Tokyo.

Japamation images of O-Ren and her Army, taking on ANOTHER
YAKUZA ARMY, among falling cherry blossoms.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH between cartoon images of this and the
real life real McCoy samurai sword battle.

O-Ren's ability is simply amazing.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
When it was all over, it was the
geisha-regaled O-Ren Ishii that
proved the victor.



INT. JAPANESE NIGHT CLUB

O-Ren has just become the official leader of crime in the
city of Tokyo. The six Yakuza clan bosses, each with TWO
BODYGUARDS standing behind them, toast their new leader, with
much laughter and drinking...all except one...BOSS TANAKA.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
And just in case you're wondering
how could a half breed Japanese
Chinese American become the boss of
all criminal activity in Tokyo,
Japan,... I'll tell you. The
subject of O-Ren's blood and
nationality came up before the
council only once. The night O-Ren
assumed power over the crime
council.

Boss Tanaka is the picture of angered ambiance among the
alcohol-fueled frivolity.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
The man who seems bound and
determined to break the mood is
Boss Tanaka. And what Boss Tanaka
thinks is...

Boss Tanaka brings his fist down on the table, smashing the
plate in front of him into itty bitty pieces.

The party comes to a halt as all eyes go to the leader of the
Tanaka Crime Family.



CRIME FAMILY LEADER  2 (JAPANESE)
Tanaka? What's the meaning of this
outburst? This is a time for
celebration.



BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
And what exactly should I be
celebrating? The perversion of our
illustrious council?

The Bosses all react with shock and outrage...O-Ren remains
cool. She raises her voice for the first word, but lowers it
for the rest of the sentence.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Gentlemen...Boss Tanaka obviously
has something on his mind. Allow
him to express it.



BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
My father...
(looking at a clan head)
...along with yours and...
(looking at another)
...along With yours, started this
council. And while you drink like
fish and laugh like donkeys, they
weep in the afterlife over the
perversion committed today.

The BOSSES react again...O-Ren;



O-REN (JAPANESE)

Silence!
(then composed)
Of what perversion do you speak,
Tanaka?

Boss Tanaka looks at the female half-breed American and says;



BOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE)
I speak, Mistress Ishii,....of the
perversion done to this council,
which I love more than my own
children,...by making a half
Chinese American its leader.

Then...

Faster than you can say Jimminy Cricket,...

O-Ren's samurai sword is unsheathed...

Boss Tanaka's head is liberated from its body...

The head hits the floor...

And from the spot between its shoulder blades, a geyser of
blood shoots up in the air.

The BOSSES who were shocked at Tanaka's words are even more
flabbergasted at O-Ren's resonse.

The two bodyguard's, standing behind Boss Tanaka, hands go to
their swords and draw them.

O-Ren turns her blade in their direction.

The Bosses and their bodyguards say nothing,...only watch.

The lady looks across at the two men and says in and
authoritative voice;



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Fight me or work for me.

They look at her for a moment, then they lower their swords.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Drop them on the ground.

They do.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Get behind me.

They do.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Get on your knees.

They do.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Put your foreheads on the floor.

They do.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Keep your mouths shut.

You better believe they do.

The mistress' eyes got to the other bosses looking at her.

As she speaks English, bodyguard translators translate for
their bosses.



O-REN
I'm going to say this in English so
you know how serious I am. As your
leader, I encourage you to -- from
time to time and always in a
respectful manner, and with the
complete knowledge that my decision
is final -- to question my logic.
If you're unconvinced a particular
plan of action I've decided is the
wisest, tell me so. But allow me to
convince you. And I will promise
you, right here and now, no subject
will be taboo...except the subject
that was just under discussion.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
(to a bodyguard)
Hand me that head.

He picks it off the floor and meekly offers it to the Queen.

She takes it by the hair and holds it up as she speaks.



O-REN (ENGLISH)

The price you pay for bringing up
either my Chinese or my American
heritage as a negative is, I
collect your fuckin head.
(now completely American)
Just like this fucker here. Now if
any of you sonsabitches got
anything else to say, now's the
fuckin time.

Nobody says anything.



O-REN (ENGLISH)
I didn't think so.
(pause)
Meeting adjourned.



EXT. THE HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES - JAPANESE RESTAURANT

The entire O-Ren Ishii crew moves through the restaurant. The
CUSTOMERS all look up now as the crew passes. The restaurant
staff acts as if the Shogun himself has just showed up on
their doorstep demanding a meal. No doubt if the meal is not
satisfactory the staff will gladly slice off a finger. The
door to a private dining room is slid open, the crew steps
inside, the door is slid shut.



INT. PRIVATE DINING AREA (RESTAURANT) - NIGHT

The private dining area of the Japanese restaurant. The
patrons are surrounded by white paper walls. The CAMERA
CIRCLES around O-REN ISHII.

Sitting in between her, two personal bodyguards, the Yubari
sisters, YUKI AND GO GO. The Yubari sisters are younger than
O-Ren; Yuki is sixteen and Go Go is seventeen. Both girls are
dressed in Japanese schoolgirl uniforms complete with plaid
skirts and matching blazers.

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EYEBALL (The BRIDE's)

On her right is her French and Japanese lawyer, SOFIE FATALE.

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EYEBALL

The bunch of mop-topped young men, who all wear black suits,
white shirts, thin black ties and Kato masks over their eyes,
are her soldiers, "The CRAZY 88."

FLASH ON
EX CU OF AN EAR, The Bride's fingers come into FRAME and move
blonde hair out of the sensory appendage's way.

And finally there's a tall dark American in a black suit sans
Kato mask -- that's O-Ren's head of security, MR. BARREL.

They're all drinking and having a good time as Sofie tells a
joke in Japanese.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
The mop tops in black suits and
Kato masks were O-Ren's soldiers,
"The Crazy 88." The two young girls
in the schoolgirl uniforms are her
personal bodyguards, the Yubari
sisters. Yuki, aged sixteen, and Go
Go, aged seventeen. The pretty lady
who's dressed like she's a villain
on Star Trek is O-Ren's best friend
and her lawyer, Sofie Fatale. And
finally, the American in the black
suit but sans Kato mask, O-Ren's
head of security, Mr. Barrel.

SUDDENLY O-Ren hears something. Like a deer in the forest,
her head springs up on alert. It's almost as if she's
listening to The Bride's narration.

The Bride's NARRATION SUDDENLY STOPS IN MIDSENTENCE --

O-Ren removes a SMALL DAGGER-DART from the folds of her robe
and THROWS IT in the direction of the sound.

CU The BRIDE dressed in a kimono
on the other side of the private dining room's paper wall.
The DART FLIES THROUGH The PAPER, STREAKS BY HER FACE, almost
taking off the tip of her nose in the process.

INSERT: DART EMBEDS ITSELF IN A WOOD POST.

O-Ren's action instantly brings the room's frivolity to a
halt. Mistress Ishii silently orders Go Go and Yuki to
retrieve the eavesdropper.



INT. JAPANESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The white paper door to O-Ren's dining room SLAMS OPEN. Yuki
and Go Go step into the corridor.

All trace of the Bride has vanished.

They look out over the restaurant, patrons look normal.

Whoever was there is gone now.

Go Go removes the small dagger from the wood post and the
Yubari sisters go back into the private dining room, SLAMMING
the door behind them.

ONE SHOT

CU The BRIDE
at the bar, in her kimono, drinking a colorful cocktail. She
observes all the activity by O-Ren's private dining room.
When the Yubari sisters go back inside, the Bride climbs off
her barstool and goes through the restaurant...into the
parking area...and up to her rental car. She opens the door.
Takes off her Japanese kimono, underneath is a one-piece
yellow track suit with a black stripe going down both sides,
like the one Bruce Lee wears in "Game of Death." She tosses
the kimono in the trunk, then removes the sheathed Hanzo
sword. With the sword of vengeance in her hand, we follow her
back inside the restaurant. She looks upstairs to the O-Ren
dining room. We see Yuki Yubari and Sofie Fatale, slide open
the door, and walk down the stairs together. When they get to
the bottom, they give each other a kiss goodbye, and Yuki
leaves the restaurant, while Sofie makes her way to the
bathroom...only to have The Bride, now dressed in her Bruce
Lee yellow outfit and samurai sword in her hand, bar her way.

END OF SHOT
BACK AND FORTH
between CU's of the two women, face to face.



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
(to Bride)
Can I help you?



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Yes, I am looking for the attorney
of O-Ren Ishii, Sofie Fatale. Would
that be you?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
I'm Mistress Ishii's attorney. How
can I help you?

The Bride PUNCHES her in the face.



INT. O-REN'S PRIVATE ROOM

Aside from drinking like fishes, what is the queen of the
Tokyo underworld - Mistress O-Ren Ishii - and her private
army doing when we cut back?

Singing karaoke, of course.

It's Crazy 88 MIKI's turn at the mike and he's having a whale

of a good time singing Dionne Warwick's "Walk On By," in
Japanese....

WHEN...

A COMMOTION is heard being made by the restaurant staff and
the other patrons, from the other side of the white paper
wall...Just as they all start to notice it, they hear;



THE BRIDE (O.S., JAPANESE)
O-Ren Ishii! You and I have
unfinished business!

The Crazy 88 spring to their feet. One slides open the door.

They see O-Ren's lawyer, Sofie Fatale, standing in the middle
of the restaurant, her left arm completely outstretched, hand
gripped around a post. She has a terrified look on her face.
Before anybody on O-Ren's side of the room can say anything
...The Bride steps out from behind Sofie.

O-REN'S
reaction shows how effective the element of surprise turned
out to be. She says The Bride's name softly to herself; it's
BLEEPED OUT.

The Bride
The VENGEANCE THEME BURSTS ON THE SOUNDTRACK...The Vein on
her forehead begins to pulsate. WE DO A QUICK SHAW BROTHERS
ZOOM INTO HER EYES. A SPAGHETTI-WESTERN FLASHBACK of O-Ren
beating the shit outta her at the wedding chapel IS
SUPERIMPOSED OVER HER EYES. The FLASHBACK DISSOLVES, we ZOOM
BACK INTO A CU, the vein stops pulsating, and the theme STOPS
PLAYING OVER THE SOUNDTRACK, LEAVING A CLEAN, COLORFUL CU of
The Bride loaded for bear.

She raises her Hanzo sword, and Slices off Sofie's Arm at the
Shoulder with one stroke.

SOFIE
Spewing and Gushing Blood from her stump, twists her body in
agony, painting the floor and the walls with giant Splashes
of Red, as her body hits the floor, twitching in both
surprise and shock.

The CRAZY 88
run out into the dining area and create a human wall between
themselves and their Mistress.

MR. BARREL AND GO GO
take positions on either side of O-Ren.

O-REN
seated in a shogun's seat, rises furiously to her feet.



O-REN (JAPANESE)

You bastard!

The Bride does a swipe in the air with her sword; Sofie's
blood flies off the blade.

The entire floor of the dining room lies between the two
warring parties.


The Bride
vs.
The Crazy 88

The restaurant's STAFF and PATRONS sit or stand rigidly in
fear.

O-Ren says loudly to the room;



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Sorry everybody, but I'm afraid
we're going to have to close the
place. There's some private
business that we must attend to
now.

The Staff and The Customers Stampede the exits.

The Bride, The Crazy 88, and O-Ren hold    their ground without
moving a muscle, till the dining room,    as well as the entire
restaurant known as "The House of Blue    Leaves," is deserted
of every human not engaged in the face-   off that precedes
combat.

O-Ren gives a simple order;



O-REN
Miki.

MIKI, one of The Crazy 88 (The little one), steps forward,
unsheaths his sword, and yells at the yellow clad blonde.



MIKI (JAPANESE)
You had it coming bastard!

Raising his samurai sword high, he Charges, Screaming A
Banzai Scream...

The Bride turns to face him.

Miki Charging and Screaming...

The Bride slowly raises the Hanzo Sword into Striking
Position.

Miki Charging and Screaming, almost on top of her.

The Bride, sword in position, waits for her opponent to
arrive.

Miki arrives at his destination, he Swings...

The Bride Swings...

The Hanzo Sword Slices Miki's inferior blade in half. Miki
looks down at the impotent weapon in his hand.

The Bride Thrusts her sword through Miki's abdomen, then
Lifts the little guy off the ground straight up in the air.

Miki screaming, Impaled on her blade like a fish at the end
of a spear. Held up in the air, restaurant light fixtures in
the B.G.

O-Ren and her crew watch stunned.

The Bride Drops the shishkabobbed Miki into the koi pond that
starts outside the restaurant and ends inside, with a huge
blue splash. Koi pond - Blue water - Orange and yellow fish -
Red blood - Dead man.

The BRIDE
looks up from the pond, across the length of the    floor, into
the eyes of O-Ren Ishii.
She takes one step forward, hears the slightest    noise, Twirls
the samurai sword in the air once, drops to one    knee, and
thrusts the sword into the beige-colored carpet-   covered
floor. The sword sticks in the floor half way...

The Sound of human death rises from underneath the floor...

OVERHEAD SHOT
Looking down on The    Bride at one end and O-Ren and her crew
at the other. A Red    Circle appears where the blade is buried
in the floor...The    red circle grows larger...and larger...and
larger...and larger    still...

Leaving the sword stuck in the floor, handle sticking
straight up in the air, The Bride rises up from her one knee,
and straight and tall, staring down the queen of the Tokyo
underworld.

O-Ren
her eyes narrow with rage. She screams out another order;



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Tear the bitch apart!

The six remaining Crazy 88 unsheath their swords at the same
time with a GREAT SOUND EFFECT.

They circle the Bride.

The BRIDE
Inside the circle of Combatants who surrounded her. She Whips
the sword out of the floor and raises her blade diagonally in
front of her. Her eyes are reflected in the shiny steel.

Holding her sword in the diagonal position, The Bride can see
reflected in the shiny blade, whoever stands behind her.

The six Crazy 88 Attack...

The BRIDE
does a Zatoichi-like SWISH-SLASH-SWISH with her steel blade.

Four boys die an    immediate samurai blade-inflicted death,
SCREAMING GRUNT,    TWITCHING BODY, FROZEN IN THE STANCE IT WAS
SLASHED IN, RED    BLOOD SQUIRTING FROM WOUNDS, THEN A CRASHING
COLLAPSE TO THE    FLOOR.

The last two put up more of a fight...but then one of them is
SLASHED and FALLS and the last one is SLASHED AND CRASHES
THROUGH the restaurant's big picture window.

EX CU The EYES
of The Bride, pointed down at the bodies by her feet,

...BEAT

...they Look back up at O-Ren.

O-REN
standing in between Go Go and Mr. Barrel. Her eyes narrow.

The BRIDE
swipes the air with her sword, the blood of the dead
attackers flies off.

GO GO and MR. BARREL
unsheath their swords.

WHEN...

We hear a LOUD SOUND of many ENGINES behind the Bride. Then
behind her, through the broken pictures window we see
seventeen motorcycles pull up to the parking lot. All the
riders wear black suits with kato masks, and all carry
samurai swords.

The BRIDE
looks from the reinforcements to O-Ren.

O-REN
smiles.



O   -REN (ENGLISH)
(to the     Bride)
You didn't     think it was going to be
that easy,     did you?

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
(to O-Ren)
You know, for a second there, yeah
I did.

O-Ren smiles...



O-REN (ENGLISH)
Silly rabbit...

Both O-Ren and the Bride finish the phrase together,...



O-REN THE BRIDE
...Trix Are for kids.

This is something they used to say back when they fought
alongside of each other as "Vipers."

The seventeen Crazy 88 reinforcements come running into the
restaurant and with drawn swords surround The Bride.

As a HEAVY METAL COMBAT BEAT begins to PULSATE ON THE
SOUNDTRACK, The Boys and The Bride have a Spaghetti Western
Stand-off.

We do a 360 INSIDE the CIRCLE of The Crazy 88, who surround
the yellow-haired warrior. Not all have Samurai swords; one
JUGGLES TWO HATCHETS, another TWIRLS A THREE-STAFF TRIPLE
IRON over his head.

As the Heavy Metal music builds...We Cut to various Shots of
The Two Opposing Forces Preparing to Strike....Hands on Sword
Handles...Feet finding Combat Stance...etc...

....Until Heavy Metal reaches its Breaking Point...

...At that point, the Metal EXPLODES OVER THE SOUNDTRACK...IN
TIME WITH The BRIDE EXPLODING INTO A VIOLENT KILLING MACHINE
ON SCREEN.

As she matches skill with the army of black-suited boys, arms
flailing, silver blade Clashing and Slashing, long blonde
hair whipping like a whirling dervish....
...She's a Goddess of War Venus.

Not only is the FIGHT CUT TO THE HEAVY METAL MUSIC, but The
Bride seems to be somewhat dancing to it as she fights.

This explosion of furious violence is punctuated
CINEMATICALLY BY THE COLOR IN THE FILM POPPING OFF, and the
fight being filmed in HIGH CONTRAST BLACK AND WHITE, turning
the squirting, spewing geysers of BLOOD FROM CRIMSON RED TO
OIL BLACK.

Many members of The Crazy 88 are Sliced, Slashed, and
liberated from the limbs they were born with at The Bride's
blade.

Some SPECIFIC MOMENTS

While Clashing swords, The Bride whips the silver Boomerang
out of its holster, and Throws it...

....It Twirls Through the Air...

...Embedding itself longways in one of the boy's faces.

The Bride does a Mid-Air Somersault over the head of an
Attacker, landing solid on her feet behind him...Slash, he's
Out.

The Bride is knocked to the floor, her Attacker stands over
her to Spear the young blonde, Her Legs Spring Up In The Air,
Ankles Lock Around The Boy's Neck.

She throws him down to the ground. With his neck still in the
vise-like grip of her ankles, She removes The SOG Knife from
its sheath and Plunges it Deep Into The Boy's Chest.

While still on the ground, an Attacker Charges at her.
Yanking the Boomerang out of the Dead Boy's Face, She Sends
It Flying in the Charging Man's path...

...Boomerang Twirling Through the Air Close to the Ground...

...Chopping Off the Charging Attacker's Foot in Mid Step, he
falls flat.

The Bride jumps up onto an attacker's shoulders. She locks
her legs around him so he's helpless at shaking her off.

...she swings down with her sword, and cuts the man's hands
off.

So while the helpless man with no hands screams, the now nine
foot tall Bride fights with the others.

When she's through she brings the blade across the man she's
perched on's throat. He falls to his knees, bringing the
Bride back to the floor like an alevator.

As soon as her soles touch ground, she's off his shoulders,
somersaulting on the floor, bringing her blade up between an
attacker's legs into his groin.

He lets out a scream, as she yanks her blade free.

ONE ATTACKER steps out from the rest, "The Best One." He
Twirls his sword expertly, challenging the young woman to,
"Come get a piece."

The Bride does a screaming charge towards him....
...Sword raised, The Attacker stands his ground, calm -
steady, waiting for the blonde-haired locomotive to

collide.....They meet.....

SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE - SWING - CLASH - SPIN -
CLASH - LOCK - TWIRL - SEPARATE -

They match each other blow for blow, till one makes a
mistake. It's the male. The Bride's swing, that's neither
clashed or blocked, slices off his right arm.

...The arm, still gripping the samurai sword, drops to the
floor.

The Bride pushes the Hanzo Sword right through the middle of
his chest.

Only half of the Crazy 88s that started the fight remain
alive, or intact...They start to approach...The Bride, still
holding the sword that's still impaling the skilled Attacker,
backs up, keeping his body between her and the remaining
killers.

Like a boxer, The Bride uses the momentary break in the
action, to rest on her feet.....THEN...yanks the blade from
his chest cavity....The Body Twitches - Spasms - Grunts and
Crashes to the floor.

The Attackers start to close in...The Bride readies herself
for their attack....THEN (in perfect time with the Heavy
Metal)...Drops to the floor on her back, Spinning like a top.
She Swings and Slashes and Cuts down below at their legs and
feet, like some hellish samurai sword-weilding turtle flipped
over on its shell....

Many black-suited, mask-wearing boys drop to the ground.

...Still Spinning like a break dancer, she spins up on top of
her head, and Pops back up on her feet.

And then there were seven.

The seven remaining sword-weilding, black-suited boys moved
out of range of the Bride's blade when she dropped to the
floor. Now spread out, they make a large half-circle.

The Bride, slowly points the tip of her blade to the floor,
lowers herself to one knee and slightly bows her head. In
repose.

EX CU The Bride's eyes
pointed up, watch them move closer, COLOR COMES BACK INTO THE
FILM. We see her face is splashed with blood.

O-REN
WHIPS OPEN a red fan.

GO GO stands by the restaurant's junction box, she flips the
switch.

The room goes dark.

The Crazy 7 make a wide circle around the blonde who's still
on the floor....

...Looking down on her breathing hard in the shadows. As she
breathes in and out, The FACE OF A LIONESS IS SUPERIMPOSED
OVER HER FACE.

Breathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) - Breathe in
(Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) .....

The Bride rises to her feet...

The Crazy 7 move in a circle around The Bride, she moves in a
circle inside of their circle, all eight of them move in
rhythm with the Metal...

The Heavy Metal Music builds....to a big finish...THEN both
Music and The Bride Explode!

WIDE SHOT - FRAMED LIKE A KABUKI STAGE
With the lights off, The White paper wall the eight killers
fight in front of turns a Psychedelic Bright Blue. The snow
falling outside is reflected against the paper wall like
black snow falling on a blue shadow puppet stage.

The eight samurais are Black Silhouettes against the blue
backdrop. They begin to combat in a dance of blood, steel and
death. The Bride does a sword-weilding dosey-doe with all
sword-weilding partners.

She CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASHES with all of them - They
seperate - stalk each other for a moment to the beat - then
CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASH again, with The Bride killing or
hacking the limbs of one unlucky dance partner at each
encounter - Sometimes during the separation, The Bride
crouches down low in repose while the others continue to
circle stalk...THEN...She Strikes again.

We Cut in closer whenever we need to.

Finally the last of O-Ren's soldiers falls to the Bride's
sword.

GO GO
Standing by the junction box, flips a switch turning the
lights back on. The electricity shines light on...

The BRIDE
Splashed all over with blood. Blood painting the floor, walls
and ceiling. Dead bodies, several limbs, and horribly wounded
men who have yet to die, litter the ground.

With a big "Whoosh" in the air, the blood of O-Ren's
subordinates fly off the blonde avenger's blade.

Then saying to the foes who litter the ground.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Those    of you lucky enough to still
have    your lives. Take them with
you.    But leave the limbs you've
lost.    They belong to me now.

The wounded men, crawl out of the restaurant.

The yellow-haired crimson-covered woman, looks to the last
remaining combatants...Mr. Barrel, Go Go Yubari, and O-Ren
Ishii.

Go Go
steps forward and removes her weapon, it's not a samurai
sword. It's a heavy metal ball at the end of a long chain.
She begins TWIRLING it above her head. Each rotation makes a
WHOOSH sound in the air.

BALL AND CHAIN
in a 3-D-like effect, the metal ball comes right at us.

The BRIDE
ducks out of the way, the heavy ball destroying a large chunk
of wood post behind her.

Go Go
eyes focused on her enemy...WHOOSH....WHOOSH....WHOOSH...she
lets fly...

The ball and chains wrap around the blade of the Hanzo
sword...

...Go Go yanks...

...the Hanzo sword FLIES out of her grip.

GO GO
smiles...then...WHOOSH...WHOOSH...

The BRIDE
removes her boomerang and THROWS it at Go Go.

The BOOMERANG
TWIRLS through the air heading right for Go Go.

BAM

The young bodyguard    swats it out of the air with her ball and
chain. She lifts up    her chain and the boomerang lies bent, on
the floor. She looks    across at her opponent...WHOOSH...
WHOOSH...WHOOSH..she    LETS FLY. It Strikes the Bride in the
chest, knocking her    on her back...

...Go Go twirls it over her head and sends it towards the
Bride on the floor. The Bride rolls out of the way, the metal
ball PUNCHES a hole in an overturned table instead.

The weaponless Bride wrestles a table leg loose from its
purpose.

She hops up on a table, table leg in hand, ready to fight.

Go Go hops up on a table...

As they fight they hop from table to table...

Go Go throws her ball and chain...

...The Bride - QUICK AS A WHIP...

BATS it away with the table leg.

Go Go lets loose with the balls and chain...it wraps around
the Bride's ankle...Go Go YANKS...

...The Bride's leg is yanked out from under her, she FALL
CRASHING through another table.

Go Go jumps on top of the Bride, attacking her with a samurai
short sword. The Bride uses the table leg to block it.

The women fight fiercely, locked in grapple, each face ugly
with struggle. Go Go lets her left earlobe get too close to
the Bride's mouth...the Bride BITES DOWN on it. Go Go screams
as the lower part of the appendage is bitten off, and she
rolls off the Bride. The Bride comes at her, bringing the
table leg -- WHOOPS UPSIDE HER HEAD -- WHOOP-WHOOP-SIDES-HER
HEAD.

The girl in the schoolgirl uniform falls on her back, and
delivers a powerful "C.K." to the Bride from below, dropping
her to her knees.

O-Ren is UP, and wraps the chain around the Bride's neck and
begins to strangle.

The chain digs into the Bride's throat.

The Bride brings the table    leg, which    has a couple of    nasty
looking nails in it, hard    against the    Japanese girl's    thigh.
The nails cut through the    plaid school    uniform skirt    into her
flesh...the Bride rips out    the nails,    taking some leg    meat
with them.

Go Go lets out a horrific scream.

The Bride brings the table leg down on the toe of the young
girl's white tennis shoe. The nails stick in, the white shoe
becomes stained with red.

Go Go SCREAMS letting loose of the chain...falling on the
floor.

The Bride unwraps the chain around her neck, and begins
breathing air into her lungs.

Go Go tries to escape, dragging her fucked-up leg with her...

The Bride rises from the floor and begins, twirling Go Go's
weapon above her head.

Go Go, fast as she can, climbs up the stairs to the second
floor...

The Bride stands at the bottom of the stairs, twirling the
ball and chain over her head.

Go Go frantically, and in great pain, climbs the stairs...
She gets to the top.

The Bride lets loose with the ball and chain...

It HITS the female bodyguard and one half of the Yubari
sisters, smack DAB in the back of the head.

CU GO GO
We see her face as she's delivered a death blow right behind
it. We see behind her eyes and features, her life and spirit
shatter like a teapot.

Like a discarded rag doll, Go Go Yubari TUMBLES down the
staircase landing in a pile at the Bride's feet. Dead before
the tumble began.

The Bride throws the ball and chain to the floor. Her eyes go
to the last two remaining combatants...

...Mr. Barrel and O-Ren Ishii.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Any more subordinates for me to
kill, O-Ren?

Mr. Barrel says;



MR. BARREL
One last one.



THE BRIDE
You're Mr. Barrel, right?



MR. BARREL
And you're Black Mamba.



THE BRIDE
Our reputations precede us.



MR. BARREL
Apparently.

THE BRIDE
Tell me Mr. Barrel, why don't you
wear your Kato mask? Are you and
iconoclast?

Mr. Barrel takes out a kato mask on a stick, like from a 17th
Century costume ball, and holds it over his eyes.



MR. BARREL
I don't like that rubber band. It
fucks up my hair.



THE BRIDE
You shouldn't work for her.



MR. BARREL
Too late.



THE BRIDE
It's not too late to quit.



MR. BARREL
Do you have choices?



THE BRIDE
No.



MR. BARREL
I know exactly how you feel.



THE BRIDE
This has nothing to do with You and
I, and everything to do with me
taking satisfaction from that bitch
behind you. And there's absolutely
positively no way I'M going to
leave here without taking that
satisfaction. So Mr. Barrel, you
have to stand aside. And that means
you must quit, right now.

MR. BARREL
I can't.



THE BRIDE
Yes you can.



MR. BARREL
No I can't.



THE BRIDE
Don't say "Can't", there are no
"Cant's." Yes - You - Can.....

O-REN ISHII
Screams at her "...last line of defense;"



O-REN (ENGLISH)
What are you waiting for? Are you
on a date? Attack her you fool!



THE BRIDE
Oh my God...
(pause)
...She just called you a fool. She
just called you a fool in front of
me. Not only am I your opponent.
I'm a female fellow countryman.
And you're going to risk your life -
to say nothing of harming me - for
a woman who refers to you as a
fool?

O-REN
is furious, and slaps Mr. Barrel on the shoulder.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Attack, Goddamn you!

The Bride acts like she's embarrassed to witness what she
just saw.

Mr. Barrel spins in O-Ren's direction shooting her a look
she's never seen from him before.

He then looks back to the Bride.

Her eyes are waiting for his. She says with just the
slightest hint of plea in her voice;



THE BRIDE
I'll owe ya one.

He looks at her a BEAT longer...then says as he resheaths his
sword;



MR. BARREL
The things I do for a pretty face.

INSERT: The Blade sliding back down into the Sheath, The
Handle locks into place with a Click.

He looks back over his shoulder at his former Mistress, and
says;



MR. BARREL (JAPANESE)
I quit.

O-Ren fries and egg on her head.

Then   with his sheathed Sword    in his right hand, and his left
hand   in his pants pocket, he    walks across the carnage-strewn
room   and out the front door.    As he walks, when he's parallel
with   the Bride, He stops and    says;



MR. BARREL
About that one you owe me.



THE BRIDE
Yes?



MR. BARREL
I'm gonna collect someday, you
know?



THE BRIDE
I'll be disappointed if you don't.

He continues walking without a look back. Before he Exits the
restaurant, he throws a look in Sofie's direction, Who's
lying minus her arm in a pool of her own blood, and says;

MR. BARREL
Tough luck bout that arm Sofe.

He exits the Movie.

O-REN and The BRIDE
match eyes. The Japanese gal says;



O-REN (ENGLISH)
Very funny.
(pause)
Your instrument is quite
impressive.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Domo.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Where was it made?



THE BRIDE
Okinawa.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Whom in Okinawa made you this
steel?



THE BRIDE
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
YOU LIE!!

The Bride just smiles at her rival's response.

O-Ren's composure returns.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Swords however never get tired. I
hope you've saved your energy. If
you haven't, you might not last
five minutes.
(pause)

Have you seen the garden in this
establishment?



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
No.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Oh, you really should. It's quite
beautiful. Allow me.

O-Ren moves out of the position she's stood in for the entire
battle. She steps on the doormat of a corpse, that serves the
same purpose of a bottom step, and moves over to the white
paper wall and slides it open....REVEALING....

.....A WHITE WINTER WONDERLAND, set against a Jet Black sky.
A Snow-covered Japanese Garden awaits right outside. Snow
falls from the sky (Slightly artificial, not phony - but
Operatic Theatrical). O-Ren stands next to the Bride in the
doorway looking out into the white night.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
As last looks go, you could do
worse.

The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld steps outside...

The Bride follows her...



INT. SNOW-COVERED JAPANESE GARDEN - NIGHT

As snow falls around them, they stand the correct distance
from one another.

COMBAT MUSIC BEGINS PLAYING, but not Japanese drums - Spanish
Flamenco Guitar.......

The Bride Unsheaths her Sword Quickly...Holding it out in
front of her...Tip of Blade pointed at O-Ren...Sword's Handle
and her Fingers wrapped around that handle, up by her
cheek...Her eyes are Reflected on the Blade...Snow falls
around her.

O-Ren begins walking forward towards the Bride...She raises
up her Sword, still in its sheath, in front of her face
vertically...then begins slowly unsheathing it...Snow falls
around her.

O-REN'S FEET
White socks in wooden clogs, walk forward, Crunching Snow
underneath them...

The BRIDE
Holding Sword...Eyes reflected in Blade...her Yellow Sneakers
Crunching snow underneath them...

O-REN
when her Sword is fully unsheathed, the Japanese combat
artist holds both arms straight out at her sides, Sword in
one hand - Wood sheath in the other, like a bird....

....The Two Women circle each other....

They SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...CIRCLE...SWING -
CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...

O-REN LEAPS in the air
does a Somersault over the Bride's head, landing behind her
opponent. She brings her Sword down in a Slashing Swing...

SLASHING The BRIDE
across her back - Spinning her around...

O-Ren goes in for the kill...The Bride meets her blade... The
Blades Clash and Lock...The Two Women's faces come together
as the Blades become entangled...

O-Ren moves her arm in a counter-clockwise motion that
loosens the grip enough to bring her sword handle hard into
The Bride's mouth...

Knocking her backwards over a small, stone bench - Flat on
her ass in a koi pond.

- The Combat Guitar Stops -

O-Ren doesn't charge the fallen blonde, She laughs;



O-REN (ENGLISH)
Silly Caucasian girl likes to play
with samurai swords. Bill might of
humored you, but you will find
neither humor nor mercy at my
blade. Now unless you intend to
commit sepeku among the koi, stand
up and fight. You may not be able
to fight like a samurai, but you
can at least die like a samurai.

The Combat Guitar starts again...As The Bride slowly rises
out of the koi pond. She brings up her sword and Says Calmly
to O-Ren in Japanese;



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Attack me. With everything you
have.

The Two Women Clash Swords furiously, their attack ends with

The Bride's Striking O-Ren - not fatally - but deep. They
separate...

...breathing hard...Cold Air coming out of their mouths like
two locomotives...

O-Ren looks down to her wound, then back up to The Bride. The
respect for the Bride's ability is transparent.

The Two Women Circle Stalk each other again...

Red Blood running down Yellow Legs onto Yellow Sneakers...

Wooden Clogs crunching the Snow, Blood trail dripping down
legs staining White Socks with Red...

They Attack, the Geisha figurine and The tall western girl
with the mane of Whipping Blonde Hair. They Swing - Twist -
Turn - Clash, matching blow for blow till they both back off.

Both Women are out of breath and have    to stop to recuperate.
As they both drink the harsh cold air    into their lungs,
leaving red blood stains in the white    snow, the two females
have the same thought. The next clash    will be their last.



O-REN (JAPANESE)
I apologize for ridiculing you
earlier.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Accepted.

They continue breathing...



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Ready?



O-REN (JAPANESE)
Yes.

The Flamenco Guitar begins again, as The Two Women Circle
each other for their final attack.

With all the quickness and skill at their command, they clash
in a superb display of Samurai Swordplay...TILL...They Find
themselves on opposite sides of a garden wall...

...The Bride and O-Ren both begin Running diagonally through
the snow, Swords held up high, Facing each other, Continuing
to run even after they passed the wall, Screaming their
Samurai hearts out...

UNTIL...

They both SWING...

...can't tell who got who...

A SCALP OF LONG, BLACK HAIR FLIES THROUGH THE AIR, landing in
the white snow.

CU O-REN ISHII
facing away from the Bride. Sword still in her hand. We see
she doesn't have the TOP OF HER HEAD ON. A touch of her BRAIN
is exposed. Blood Droplets streak her face like raindrops.
The Queen of the Tokyo Underworld, who's regime has just
ended with one swing, stares off into space.



O-REN (ENGLISH)
That really was a Hattori Hanzo
sword...

Her sword FALLS from her grip...in the snow by her feet.



O-REN (ENGLISH)
I always dreamed of owning one...

O-Ren FALLS to her knees, toppling forward.

Left Cheek in the snow, just barely alive, She says;



O-REN (ENGLISH)
Did he make it for you?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Yes.

The Last thing she says before she dies;



O-REN (ENGLISH)
...He must of liked you.

With her cheek resting against the snow, her eyes close and
she's gone.

The BRIDE
removes a white handkerchief (The One we saw her sewing
earlier with "Bill" in the corner), and uses it to wipe the
blood, once belonging to the first name on her death list,
off her Hanzo Steel.

EX CU THE HANZO SWORD

is returned back to its sheath. The LION'S HEAD that Hanzo
carved into the wood seems pleased.

CUT TO:

The BRIDE
now wearing a yellow, faceless motorcycle crash helmet on her
head, stands FRAMED in a TRUNK SHOT.

SOFIE FATALE
Minus an arm, lies curled up in the trunk of her MAZDA XOXO.

The BRIDE slams the trunk, SCREEN BOES BLACK...

The MAZDA driving down the road at supersonic speed.

The BRIDE
behind the wheel wearing her crash helmet. It looks like an
insert from "GRAND PRIX."

POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD
car speeding...then stopping.

BLACK SCREEN
The BRIDE lifts up trunk lid, we look up at her FRAMED in the
TRUNK SHOT. Helmet on head making her faceless, gold Deadly
Viper syringe in her hand.

When she speaks it comes out of a VOICE BOX at the bottom of
the helmet. Turning her voice deeper and electronically
spooky. The two women speak Japanese to each other.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I've kept you alive for one reason.
Information. Being O-Ren's lawyer,
I take it you're familiar with
Bill?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
Yes.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
In fact, I'd guesstimate, you
worked for Bill before O-Ren, and
that's how it is you came to work
for O-Ren. Am I correct?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
Yes.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I thought so. Give me the arm you
have left.



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
Why?



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I want information. Now gimme your
arm.

Sofie offers up her remaining arm.

She injects Sofie with the gold syringe.



THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE)
The cocktail racing    through your
bloodstream at this    moment is
Bill's own recipe.    He calls it "The
Undisputed Truth."

Sofie is injected.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Okay, first things first. Where was
the other Yubari sister? Yuki?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
Yuki's sick. She went home early.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Do tell? What's wrong with her?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
She has a cold.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Awwww poor baby. What do you think
she'll do when she finds out what
happened?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)

She'll wail with grief.

SHOCK CUT TO

YUKI YUBARI upon hearing the news of her sister's death...

She SCREAMS!

BACK TO SOFIE



SOFIE
She'll drink excessively.

BACK TO YUKI
Big bottle of sake in her mouth pointed bottom up.

BACK TO SOFIE



SOFIE
She'll start trouble.

BACK TO YUKI
sitting at a bar in drunken stupor. An OLDER JAPANESE MAN in
a business suit sits next to her at the bar...he puts the
make on her.



BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE)
Do you like Ferraris?

Yuki staring out into space, says with a drunken voice;



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Ferrari...Italian trash.

She slowly turns to face the older Japanese man in the
business suit.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Do you find me hot?

The man in the business suit giggles at her boldness; she
gets annoyed;



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Don't laugh! Do you want to fuck
me, yes or no?

BUSINESS SUIT (JAPANESE)
Yes.

THEN...

He lets out a GRUNT coming from below.

We see she has stabbed him in the belly with a samurai short
sword, and is slowly dragging the blade across his abdomen,
creating a big red grin across his mid-section.

TWO SHOT YUKI AND BUSINESS SUIT
Yuki focused, Business Suit penetrated...She opens him up
more...he feels every inch of the blade's progress.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
How bout now, big boy, do you still
wish to penetrate me...

Blade cuts deeper...



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Or is it I who has penetrated you.

And with her last line, does the final disemboweling slice
that sends his insides spilling out onto the barroom floor.

BACK TO SOFIE



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
When she stops shedding tears,
she'll start shedding blood.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Best guess, what will she do?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
I don't hafta guess, she'll come
after you.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Will she ever give up?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
She won't have to. When she finds

you, I don't know who will win. But
what I do know is, she will find
you.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Is she more skilled than I?



SOFIE (JAPANESE)
Skilled won't be the word.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Don't be coy with me, bitch. What
would be the word?



SOFIE
Crazy.

The Bride takes this in...then moves on.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Okay, now I want all the
information on the Deadly
Vipers,... What they've been doing
and where I can find them.



EXT. TOKYO GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

The big hospital of TOKYO is located by a hill by the
highway. Sofie's MAZDA pulls off the highway to the side.

The Bride hops out of the car, runs to the back, opens the
trunk, takes out Sofie's body, and rolls it down the
hill....Sofie stops rolling in front of the entrance of the
huge hospital.

CUT TO:

CU SOFIE
in a hospital environment. Bill's voice speaks to her OFF
SCREEN;



BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
Sofie, Sofie, my Sofie, I'm so
sorry.

SOFIE (ENGLISH)
Please forgive my betrayal --

He shhhh's her off screen;



BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
-- no more of that. I invented that
truth serum. Once it entered your
bloodstream, you no longer had a
choice.



SOFIE (ENGLISH)
But, still --



BILL (O.S.; ENGLISH)
-- But still -- nothing, except my
aching heart over what she's done
to my beautiful and brilliant
Sofie.
(pause)
If you had to guess why she left
you alive, what would be your
guess?



SOFIE (ENGLISH)
Guessing won't be necessary. She
informed me.

BACK TO THE BRIDE AT THE TRUNK



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
I'm allowing you to keep your
wicked life for one reason and one
reason only. So you can tell him,
in person, everything that happened
here tonight. I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy..., by
witnessing your deformed body. I
want you to tell him, all the
information you just told me. I
want him to know what I know. I
want him to know I want him to
know.

Then with SUPERMAN X-RAY VISION we see through the helmet to
the Bride's face inside as she says the last line.

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
And I want them all to know,
they'll all soon be as dead as O
REN.

WE CUT TO A

CU of SOFIE
WE PAN to a CU of YUKI

Bill says off screen;



BILL (O.S.; JAPANESE)
If O-Ren was number one, unless
she's being tricky, Vernita Green
will be number two.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Where is Vernita Green?



BILL (O.S., JAPANESE)
Los Angeles. Vernita's in Pasadena.
But the woman you want will hold up
in a low budget motel, fifteen of
twenty minutes away from stepping
on board a plane departing LAX. If
I had to bet...I'd say Hawthorne.

Yuki blows a pink bubble gum bubble, it pops and she says in
English;



YUKI (ENGLISH)
California, here I come.

CUT TO:

CU HATTORI HANZO
He's sewing something that requires a lot of concentration.

CU The BRIDE
lies naked on her stomach, head up, chin resting on her
folded hand, feeling no pain at the needle piercing her
flesh. The sleeping giant is awake, and in her eyes we see
she's filled with a terrible resolve.

We hear music under this card...

MONTAGE OF YUKI coming to Los Angeles cut to music.

barrettes in her hair, flying on a jet enroute to Los
Angeles. She paints her fingernails with bubble gum-colored
nail polish.

Yuki walks through LAX.

We see her cool convertible sports car and her finger
pointing at it.

fast as she can through the twists and turns of the Hollywood
Hills, laughing all the way.

We see Yuki running around all over LA, Hollywood and
Disneyland taking pictures with her disposable Barbie camera.

FULL SCREEN

We stay with Yuki's side as she stops across the street from
the Bride. During their face-off we only see the Bride at a
distance.

The Bride is in the b.g., back to us packing her trunk, just
about ready to make a clean getaway...

WHEN...

Yuki yells to the figure across the street.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Conigute wa!

We see the back-turned figure of the Bride slightly freeze
upon hearing the Japanese greeting. Without turning around
she says;



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Conigute wa.
(pause)
Yuki?



YUKI (ENGLISH)
Bingo!

THRILLER MUSIC begins on the soundtrack.

The Bride turns around to face the young avenger.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Can I help you?



YUKI (JAPANESE)
You can kill yourself.

Yuki giggles.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Taking a trip?



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I was.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
You still are. One way.

THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
I know you feel you must avenge
your sister. But I beg you...walk
away.

Yuki giggles.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
You call that begging? You can beg
better than that.

Yuki giggles. Then she takes out a flashlight, and switches
on the beam.



YUKI    (JAPANESE)
Can I see your    face? I've heard
your beauty is    exquisite. I would
like to see for    myself.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Sure.

Yuki shines the flashlight beam in the Bride's face.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Ohhhh,...look how pretty your face
is. Oooohhh,... I want to touch it.



THE BRIDE
Domo.



YUKI    (JAPANESE)
Your face is so    pretty, I just want
to put both of    my palms against
your cheeks and    give you little
tiny kisses.

Yuki then shines the flashlight up into her own face.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
How do I look?



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)

Very pretty.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
You're just saying that 'cause I
told you how pretty you are.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Yuki, you're gorgeous.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Really? Is that how you'd describe
me to somebody if I wasn't here?
Yuki's gorgeous?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
You bet.

Yuki giggles.



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Don't make me kill you.



YUKI (ENGLISH)
Okay.

Yuki removes the Israel sub-machine gun from behind her back
and FIRES A LOUD INTENSE VOLUME of firepower at The Bride.

The Bride dives out of her way, just as her yellow pussy
wagon is demolished by the ammo.

The Bride, with her samurai sword in her hand, and her
backpack full of money, takes off running across a couple of
front lawns...

Yuki chases her with machine gun fire...

The Bride LEAPS over a long hedge...disappearing Behind it.

Yuki runs after her, firing all the way, destroying the
hedge...

The Bride darts across the street, she hits the ground and
rolls under a Volkswagen van.

Bullet FIRE EXPLODES all around the Bride as she rolls out on
the other side. She removes her 9mm automatic and returns
fire from behind the van.

Yuki yells to her in English;



YUKI (ENGLISH)
You think you're safe! I say; Ha!

She takes out a hand grenade, removes the pin with her teeth,
and slides it towards the Bride.

The Bride sees the live hand grenade skidding and sliding on
the asphalt towards her...

She takes off running...as the Volkswagen van EXPLODES BEHIND
HER.

She cuts through the backyard of a house -- THE CAMERA TAKING
OFF WITH HER -- over their fence, in the backyard over the
fence into another yard. She trips, falling into the other
house's swimming pool. Instead of splashing around, the Bride
swims like she was in the Olympics, till she's in the shallow
end. Without breaking her stride, she runs out of the pool.
Now with her gun out, the sopping wet Bride gets to the front
of the house. It's located on a cul de sac.

WHEN...

Yuki's sports car pulls up at the end of the street.

Both women see the other.

Yuki hits the gas, firing her machine gun out the window of
her car as she speeds down the dead-end street.

The Bride, runs across lawns and hides behind parked cars on
the street, as the bullets rip up homes, lawns, and
automobiles.

When Yuki's car reaches the end of the dead end,...

She jerks the wheel...

SPINNING the car around, pointing it in the opposite
direction.

SHE HITS THE GAS AGAIN...

SHE PULLS THE MACHINE GUN TRIGGER AGAIN...

BULLETS TEAR UP the cars lining the street.

In the hail of bullets, the Bride tries to fire back.

Yuki reaches the end of the street and spins the car around.

She gets ready to make a third pass.

Some PEOPLE in the house behind the Bride, look out of their
front door.

The Bride yells at them;



THE BRIDE
Stay in your house and stay down on
the floor!

Yuki speeds after her, but this time she pops the curb and
drives across the front lawns on the street heading right for
her.

The Bride runs into the house she's in front of.

She runs through the living room, to the kitchen and the back
door, but the kitchen's where the family that lives here is
hiding and they block the door.

Yuki's sports car pulls up in front of the house. She stands
up in the convertible. Takes out a grenade, pulls the pin and
says;



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Time for the rabbit to come out of
her hole!

She lobs the grenade up on the porch, then throws herself
face down on the lawn.

The porch and the front of the house explodes into splinters.

Everybody in the kitchen is blown back.

Realizing there's no getting out of the back door, the Bride
runs back into the living room that's now missing a wall, and
runs up the home's staircase leading to the bedrooms.

Yuki steps into the house, sub-machine gun in hand...

The Bride makes it to the top of the stairs, and is just
about to disappear behind the upstairs hallway wall...

WHEN...

Yuki fires up at her, hitting her twice in the leg.

The upstairs hallway, two bedroom doorways line both sides of
the hallway. The Bride crashes to the floor -- SCREAMING --
blood pours out of her gunshots.

Yuki charges up the stairs...machine gun blazing, tearing up
the house.

The Bride aims her 9mm where she expects Yuki to emerge.

Yuki gets to the top of the stairs, and steps into the
hallway.

The Bride fires...

The Bride's bullet wings Yuki in the left breast, knocking
her through a bedroom doorway.



THE BRIDE
(to herself)
Gotcha!

Yuki screams like a little girl at the pain. She yells from
the doorway into the hallway;



YUKI (JAPANESE)
You fucking bitch! You shot me in
my breast! They're not fully
developed yet, you fucking asshole!
Now I'm always gonna have a dimple!

The Bride answers Yuki back with an imitation of Yuki's
giggle, which makes the youngin blow her top.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
Piss me off!

She fires her machine gun around the corner, tearing up
everything around the Bride.

When the young girl stops firing, the Bride yells;



THE BRIDE    (JAPANESE)
Yuki, in about two    minutes there's
going to be an army    of police here.
So if you're gonna    kill me, now's
the time.

From her hiding place, Yuki snorts a line of baby blue
powder. It gives her energy.



THE BRIDE (O.S., ENGLISH)
So what's it gonna be bitch?

Slapping a new clip in her machine gun.



YUKI (JAPANESE)
That fucking does it!

Yuki comes around the corner FIRING her machine gun in the

Bride's direction, ripping up everything around her.

The Bride lying flat on the floor fires her 9mm.

The explosion of ammo creates the hysteria of warfare combat.

Yuki charges the Bride, Kamakazi style.

Three more bullets rip into the Bride, the Bride fires up at
Yuki, hitting her three times in the body, knocking her off
her feet, and sending her tumbling down the stairs.

The Bride shot up, pulls herself to the top of the stairs.
She sees Yuki lying at the bottom, dead.

Yuki's face, dead,    eyes closed...then they pop up open...
Guess what...she's    not dead. Though she's bloody and her
schoolgirl uniform    is filled with bullet holes she rises. Her
head turns in the    direction of the Bride...

The Bride sees this and can't believe it...

They lock eyes...

...Yuki, who no longer has the machine gun, takes out a
deadly looking knife and snaps it open with a smile that
builds to a scream...

She charges up the steps at the Bride.

The startled Bride fires at her...the 9mm's empty...

Yuki charging up the steps, yelling, knife raised high...

The Bride, hurriedly removes the pistol she keeps in her
ankle holster.

Yuki chargin...

The Bride cocks back the hammer...

...Yuki charging, getting closer...

The Bride FIRES

Bullet hits Yuki, stops her for a quarter of a second, but
she keeps charging...

The Bride fires again...

Yuki jerks but keeps on charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging...

Bride fires...

Yuki jerks, keeps chargin, almost at her, knife raised
high...

The Bride FIRES

Yuki jerks, but keeps charging, knife ready to do its duty...

The Bride fires, but her gun jams...

Yuki leaps on her with the knife...

They struggle for a moment...

...TILL...

...The Bride realizes Yuki's dead. She tosses her to the
side.



THE BRIDE
Goddamn, what a wildcat.



INT. NURSE OWEN'S HOME - NIGHT

The phone rings and a black woman in a nurse's uniform with a
name tag on it that reads, "B. Owens," answers the phone.



NURSE OWENS
Hello.

CU The Bride
on her cell phone, a business card in her hand, with a number
written on the back that says, "B. Owens," and her phone
number. She's bleeding from her five bullet holes. Sitting in
a pool of her own blood. She's starting to tremble. We can't
see where she's at, but it's somewhere surrounded by wood
planks. The moon shines into the structure.



THE BRIDE
Hello, I'm calling Nurse Owens --



NURSE OWENS
Who is this.



THE BRIDE
You don't know me, but --



NURSE OWENS
-- And I don't want to neither. Now

I don't know how you got my number,
but you can just rip that shit up,
because --



THE BRIDE
-- I've been shot five times --



NURSE OWENS
-- Stop, I don't wanna hear no
more. I got problems of my own.



THE BRIDE
I'm dying.



NURSE OWENS
Then bitch, you better call
yourself a ambulance, cause I don't
do this shit no more.



THE BRIDE
I can't call an ambulance.



NURSE OWENS
--    No, you can call a ambulance,
you    just don't want to. But if your
ass    is really dying, you ain't got
no    motherfuckin choice.



THE BRIDE
I do have a choice, and I'm
choosing to call you. If you refuse
to help me, I'll die. And that will
be your choice.



NURSE OWENS
Bitch, I don't even know you!



THE BRIDE
What do you need to know? I'm from
Earth, I'm a woman, I'm dying, and
only you can help me.

Her last line has an effect on the hard-hearted nurse.



NURSE OWENS
Okay, where you at?



THE BRIDE
I'm in Hawthorne. I'm hiding in a
kids treehouse. It's a street
called, "Dimmick". 1-7-3-6 Dimmick
Avenue. There's a bunch of police
cars and firetrucks, about two
blocks away.



NURSE OWENS
Whatcha do, crawl two blocks?



THE BRIDE
If you can't walk, you better
crawl.

Nurse Owens likes that last line.



NURSE OWENS
You got you some money dontcha, or
am I doin this out of the goodness
of my heart?



THE BRIDE
You come and get me, today's pay
day.



NURSE OWENS
You ain't too far away. You gonna
bleed to death I get there in a
half a hour?



THE BRIDE
Probably.



NURSE OWENS
Okay, I'll be there in fifteen
minutes.

THE BRIDE
Is that Pacific Standard Time, or
C.P.T.?



NURSE OWENS
Just you better be there    when I get
there, and you better be    shot five
times, and your bony ass    better be
on your last motherfuckin    legs.



THE BRIDE
How do you know I have a bony ass?



NURSE OWENS
You sound like you have a bony ass.

The Nurse hangs up the phone.



INT. TREEHOUSE - NIGHT

The Bride sits in her own blood waiting for Nurse Owens.

Nurse Owens' head pops up from the door in the floor.



THE BRIDE
Glad you made it.



NURSE OWENS
There's cops all over here, I had
to be cool. They tend to notice
things like Negroes sneaking around
people's backyards.

The nurse hands the Bride a big bottle of Wild Turkey.



THE BRIDE
What's that?



NURSE OWENS
This shit's gonna hurt, and I ain't
got no anesthetic.

(refers to the bottle)
So git busy.



INT. NURSE OWEN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

OVERHEAD SHOT
The Bride laid out on Nurse Owens' kitchen table, while the
nurse extracts the bullets.

The Bride screams.

The TV is turned up loud to hide the screams.

The fifth slug is placed in an ashtray next to three
cigarette butts and other balls of lead.

The Bride, drunk as a skunk, says to her savior;



THE BRIDE
That fuckin smarts.

Smoking her menthol Kool, Nurse Owens says;



NURSE OWENS
Yeah, bullets are bad news. In the
future, you should avoid them if
you can.



THE BRIDE
I'll keep that in mind. So, do I
have a future?



NURSE OWENS
You'll live to kill again.



THE BRIDE
Splendid.

She passes out.

FADE TO BLACK.

DOORMAN (O.S.)
Who are you?



TWO EYES (O.S.)
They call me Bill.



DOORMAN (O.S.)
Bill what?



BILL (O.S.)
That, no one ever calls me.

A FEMALE VOICE FROM OFF SCREEN says to the Doorman;



FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Open the door Alburt, let's see
what this Bill looks like.

The door opens revealing BILL to the other side of the door,
and for the first time, to the audience. He looks cool.



INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Bill looks inside and sees a fancy hotel room converted into
a crap game. A crap table has been erected in the middle of
the suite. SEVEN MEN stand around the table trying their
luck. All playing has stopped at the opening of the door.

One woman in a beautiful black dress, stands at the head of
the table...It's her game...her name is L.F. O'BOYLE.

Bill stands in the doorway. ALBURT the doorman, who wears a

tux, waits for L.F.'s word.



L.F. O'BOYLE
Are you a policeman, Bill?



BILL
Not anymore?

L.F. laughs.



L.F.
Let him play, Alburt.

Bill steps inside and the game continues in earnest.



L.F.
(to the players)
We now return to the game already
in progress. The point is nine
gentlemen, nine is the point...

As Alburt    frisks him, Bill takes in the room. There are five
other men    all wearing black tuxedos, all carrying samurai
swords (as    is Alburt), all working for Miss O'Boyle. In his
hand Bill    holds his sheathed Hanzo sword. Referring to the
sword;



ALBURT
I'll take that.



BILL
You'll have to.

The two men stare...



L.F.
Now now boys...Mr. Bill, do you
intend to start any shit with that
sword?



BILL
I give you my word of honor, I will
start nothing.

L.F.
Good enough for me.
(back to game)



ALBURT
Miss O'Boyle required a two-hundred
dollar membership fee.



BILL
That's rather pricey.



ALBURT
You wanna play for free, go to
Vegas. You start now you'll be
there by sundown.

Bill takes out a roll of bills that would choke a rodeo bull
to death. He peels off two hundred.



BILL
I think I'll stay here. I'm
thirsty.



ALBURT
That way.

Bill walks over to the suite's bar, a YOUNG WOMAN tends it.



BILL
Beer.



BARTENDER
Twenty dollars.



BILL
Twenty dollars for a beer?



BARTENDER
High cost of living shooter. You
don't like it, go to Vegas. You can

get a prime rib dinner there for
3.95.



BILL
What am I going to do, I'm thirsty.
(throws a 20 on the bar)
Pour the beer.

The Bartender produces a dixie cup, and a can of Budweiser.
She pops the top and fills the cup, leaving half of the beer
inside the can. She then offers only the cup to Bill.



BILL
(pointing to the can)
I don't get that?

The Bartender slowly shakes her head, no.

He lifts the dixie cup to his lips, and says;



BILL
Cheers.

Bill approaches the table with his dixie cup of beer.



L.F.
Gentlemen, let's    see if the new kid
in school wants    to play right away.
(to Bill)
How bout it new    kid, you wanna
handle my bones,    or do you just
like to watch?

Dropping his money roll on the table...



BILL
I came to play.

Color L.F. impressed.



L.F.
Boys take a look at this man, he's
what Webster's calls, a gambler.
The dice belong to you , sir.

With her table stick, she pushes the dice to Bill. He takes
them and inspects them.

L.F.
I hope you're not implying
anything, friend?



BILL
(as he inspects dice)
I'm not implying anything.

Alburt starts to move from his position by the door.



ALBURT
That did it fuckhead, you're out
the door --

L.F. motions him back to his position.

The players watch L.F. And Bill, an opposite ends of the
table, trade quips.

Bill looks from the dice to L.F.



BILL
You looked me over when I stood in
your doorway. I'm looking you over
as I step up to your table. If I
don't know, I don't throw.



L.F.
Are you satisfied?



BILL
More or less.



L.F.
I think we're getting into a
antagonistic relationship.



BILL
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were
trying to take my money, and I was
trying to take yours.

L.F.
It's just a game.

Bill throws ten thousand dollars on the table, the room
reacts.



BILL
If you're game, take my bet
sportsman.



L.F.
Covered.

Bill smiles as he rolls the dice in his hand, then
throws...7...The room reacts...L.F. smiles and pushes the
money and the dice back to Bill with her stick. He picks up
his winnings, tosses them back on the table, and says;



BILL
Shoot it all.

The room reacts.



L.F.
Covered.

He holds the dice in his fist...and throws...5...



L.F.
The point is five, gentlemen, five
is the point.

Bill throws...5...more reaction...more money...



BILL
Shoot it all.



L.F.
Covered.

He shoots again, he wins again...

L.F. MOVES THE MONEY in front of him.

Bill picks up the stack of moola...L.F. Stands behind her
table, stick in her hand, eyes on her opponent.

In the midst of this silence, his beeper goes off. His eyes
go to it. It reads; ELLE DRIVER.

He raises his eyes from the beeper to L.F., casually tosses
the green on the felt and says;



BILL
Shoot it all.



L.F.
Pretty lucky tonight, huh?



BILL
Play a game of luck long enough
you're bound to meet some lucky
people.



L.F.
You know we've never been properly
introduced, I'm L.F. O'Boyle.



BILL
And I'm not interested.



L.F.
No, you're rude. Why so rude rude
boy, I'm only trying to be
friendly.



BILL
I didn't come here to make friends.
I came here to shoot a little crap.
But then your boy over there hits
me up for a two hundred dollar
privilege to play fee --



L.F.
-- That's a membership fee, good
for --



BILL

-- You and nobody else. You sell at
the bar a half can of warm piss, at
twenty bucks a shot. How much did
the six-pack cost you? 5.60, 5.65?
You're greedy O'Boyle. You're just
too Goddamn greedy. You know what I
like to do when I meet greedy
people? Take every fuckin thing
they got. Leave em with nothing.



L.F.
So that's your game, you want to
teach me a lesson?



BILL
I wanna    burn you    down. When I'm
through    with you,    you won't have a
pot to    piss, or a    window to throw
it out    of. You'll    thumb a ride out
of L.A.    wearing a    barrel.



L.F.
I could always save myself this
horrible fate by not taking your
bet.



BILL
To be replaced by a different fate.
The embarrassing truth that you run
a gutless game. I won't forget it.
I'm sure these gentlemen won't
forget it. I'm sure they'll tell
people who won't forget it. And we
won't come back. If we don't come
back, you won't get our money.
Couple of weeks, you won't have a
game.



L.F.
You got a big mouth, lucky boy. And
the idea of taking everything
you've won away, and sending you
out the door with nothing but a red
face, is so appealing to me, that I
will take your bet. But.....not
with those dice.



BILL

Oooohhh, that's....



L.F.
The house's perogative and you know
it.

She holds out her palm and two new pair of dice (black) are
placed in her hand by one of her bodyguards. She sets the
dice on the table, and moves them in front of Bill with her
stick.

Bill looks down at them.



L.F.
Maybe you would like to change your
bet?



BILL
Yes I would.....Shoot it
all.....Against myself.

His hand scoops the dice off the table.

He catches the young lady by surprise.



L.F.
What?



BILL
Did I stutter, I'm changing my bet.
I'm betting I don't make it.

From the door Alburt says;



ALBURT
You can't do that.



BILL
Oh yes I can. It's the shooter's
perogative, and she knows it.



L.F.
Covered.

He throws....

....................BOXCARS.

The spectators go apeshit.

Bill scoops up his money and looks to the lady who's game he
just busted.



BILL
Can I use your phone?



L.F.
Sure it's next to the bed.



INT. BED AREA OF HOTEL ROOM

Bill sits on the bed talking with Elle Driver on the phone.

In the b.g. L.F. is throwing everybody out.



L.F.
Game's over, get out! Get the fuck
out! No more tonight, go home....



BILL
(into phone)
Vernita's dead? When?
(pause)
What about her family?
(pause)
Nice to see Kiddo hasn't gone
completely apeshit. No idea where
she is?
(pause)
Okay that did it, we're going to
Texas and talk sense into Budd
before (BLEEP) makes him number
three.

He looks over and L.F. is sitting on the floor of the bed.
All the players have left, only L.F. and her five tuxedo boys
remain.



BILL
We're going to have a talk about
this later.
(pause)

Well, I'm not exactly among friends
at the moment.
(pause...he laughs)
I'll keep that in mind, bye bye.

He hangs up.



BILL
Got a nose problem?



L.F.
I said you could use my phone. I
didn't say I wouldn't listen.



BILL
This is true.



L.F.
You didn't burn me down you know?



BILL
Course not. First rule of any
house, ya gotta have LUCKY GUY
comes in and wipes the place out
insurance.



L.F.
If there weren't losers it wouldn't
be a game.

Standing up, folding his winnings into his inside jacket
pocket, looking at L.F. and her boys, he says;



BILL
I sincerely hope you mean that.

Without another word he exits the hotel room.

Nobody makes a move to stop him.

L.F. O'Boyle and her henchmen stand still as they wait for
the sound of the elevator in the hall.

The Bride's Voice comes on the soundtrack;

THE BRIDE (V.O.)
What L.F. O'Boyle didn't know was,
the real game was just beginning.
Bill was on the job, and she was
the target. Now Bill was the
greatest assassin of the 20th
century. In fact the term HITMAN
was coined for him. And he rarely
performs actual assassinations
anymore. However every once in
awhile - to keep his hand in - he
does. Only he plays a game. He
doesn't start big trouble...he lets
them start it. If they do, they're
dead. If they don't, not only won't
he perform, he'll take the hit off
the market. It's kind of fun
watching people gamble when they
don't know they're gambling, isn't
it?

They hear the elevator in the hall.

L.F. O'Boyle tells her men;



L.F.
Get my money back. Don't kill him.
Chop off all his fingers.

Alburt smiles.

The Five men go out the door.



INT. HALLWAY HOTEL

The Five tuxedo-clad bodyguards hit the hallway, only to
see....BILL, with his Hanzo sword unsheathed, standing at the
end.

This wasn't expected, they unsheath their swords.

He Charges at them.

In the    hotel's hallway, Bill cuts through the five men. His
mastery    of the Hanzo sword in his hand is peerless. He cuts
through    the first four rather quickly. The fifth one, Alburt,
is the    most skilled, but he too falls under the master's
blade.



INT. HOTEL ROOM

L.F. O'Boyle hides in her room, holding a gun, pointed at the
front door.

She sits in bushwhack mode, waiting for Bill, or anybody for
that matter, to step through the doorway.

WHEN...

The window her back is up against SHATTERS, and a black
gloved hand reaches inside and GRABS her by her hair, and
YANKS her out the window.



EXT. HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT

Bill on the ledge of the hotel window (the 26th floor),
outside L.F. O'Boyle's room.

He's yanked her outside and he's dangling her over the side
by her hair.



BILL
Do you know a Jessica?

L.F. Is too hysterical to answer.



BILL
Well, she knows you.

He drops her......

............... SHE FALLS....

...................................SHE SPLATS.

Bill watches her all the way down. When he's confident her
fall was fatal, he leaves the ledge.

FADE TO BLACK.

Chapter seven

"The lonely grave of
Paula Schultz"



EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER - DAY

A small camper trailer sits all by its lonesome in the middle
of a barren Texas wasteland.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS under this image;

"The city of
Austin Texas."

A fist knocks on the trailer door.

It opens, revealing    Bill's    brother, BUDD. Not the Slick
Willie Budd with the    black    suit and the silver-tipped black
cowboy boots we saw    earlier    at the wedding chapel massacre.
No, the Budd we see    now is    the Budd who climbed into a bottle
five years ago, got    himself    comfortable, and decided to live
there.

Bill, looking like    a cool million, stands out in the dirt and
dust of Budd's lot    of land, looking up at his brother in his
natural habitat. In    the B.G. we can see Elle Driver lounging
in the passenger's    seat.

Budd, surprised by the visitor, says;



BUDD
Great day in the morning. Brother
Bill livin up to his familia
obligation.



BILL
How ya doin' Budd?



BUDD
Oh, you know my life, Bill, just a
mad rush of wild parties and
wealthy women.

Budd squints into the sun at the woman in Bill's ear.



BUDD
Is that that tall blonde one-eyed
Viking bitch in the passenger seat?



BILL
It's Elle. Want to say hello?



BUDD
Never said "bye," can't seem to
think of a reason to say, "hi."

INSERT: INT. - BILL'S CAR

Elle inside, blasting both the stereo and the air
conditioner. She watches the brotherly scene play out through
the car windshield. Obviously there's no love lost between
Elle and Budd.



BUDD
What'd ya wanna talk about?



BILL
Are you not going to invite me in?



BUDD
No.



BILL
May I ask why not?



BUDD
It stinks in there, that's why. Now
what's so important it requires a
reunion?

TIME CUT

The estranged brothers continue their conversation. Budd sits
in the doorway of his trailer, bottle of jack in his hand.
Bill stands.



BUDD
You tryin to tell me she cut her
way through eighty-eight bodyguards
'fore she got to O-Ren?



BILL
No. There wasn't really eighty
eight of them, they just called
themselves The Crazy 88.



BUDD
Why.



BILL

I dunno, I guess they thought it
sounded cool. Anyhow, she had about
26 or 27 around her when (BLEEP)
attacked. They all fell under her
Hanzo sword.

The mention of a Hattori Hanzo sword gets Budd's attention.



BUDD
She got 'er a Hattori Hanzo sword?

Bill nods his head, "yes."



BILL
She has a Hanzo Jingi sword.



BUDD
He made her one? Didn't he swear a
blood oath never to make another
sword?



BILL
It would appear he's broken it.

Budd doesn't say anything at first...THEN;



BUDD
Them Japs know how to carry a
grudge don't they? Or is it just
you tend to bring that out in
people?



BILL
(pause)
I know this is a ridiculous
question before I ask, but you by
any chance haven't kept up with
your swordplay?



BUDD
Hell, I pawned that years ago.



BILL
You pawned a Hattori Hanzo sword?

BUDD
Yep.

The disrespect is pain.



BILL
It was priceless.



BUDD
Not in El Paso it ain't. In El Pso
I got me 250 Dollars for it.



BILL
Since it was a gift from me, why
didn't you offer me the chance to
buy it back?



BUDD
Because that would've required me
to acknowledge your existence.
Drunken bum though I may be, I
don't need booze that bad. But who
the hell gives a crap anyway. That
bitch ain't gittin no Bushido
points for killin a white trash
piece of shit like me with a
samurai sword. I'm a bouncer in a
titty bar, Bill. If she wants to
fight me, all she gotta do is come
down to the Club, start some shit,
and we'll be in a a fight.



BILL
-- Budd, you need to listen to me.
I know we haven't spoken for quite
some time, and the last time we
spoke wasn't the most pleasant. But
you need to get over being mad at
me, and start becoming afraid of
Bea. Because she is coming, and
she's coming to kill you. And
unless you accept my assistance, I
have no doubt she will succeed.

Budd sees Bill's true concern for his welfare.

Bill tries to charm his brother.

BILL
Can't we forget the past, and look
at the happy side of all this?

Budd chuckles.



BUDD
And what would that happy side be?



BILL
She's brought "the boys" back
together.

Budd is touched by Bill's concern and chuckles to himself.



BUDD
I appreciate the concern on your
face, but there's a difference
'tween "the boys", time can't
erase. I don't dodge guilt. And I
don't Jew outta payin my
comeuppance. That woman deserves
her revenge. And we deserve to die.
But then again, so does she. So I
guess we'll just see now, won't we.



EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

The    My-oh-my Club, is the sleazy titty bar that Budd works
at.    His job is tossin out the riff-raff that's worse than
him,    out on their ear - minus a few of the teeth they had
when    they came in. His beat-to-shit pickup truck pulls up to
the    front, and he climbs out of the automobile.



INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - DAY

Budd walks into the wood-paneled titty bar. No strippin goin
on yet, just a few BARFLIES drinkin. The owner, TED, yells at
him as he walks by.



TED
You're late, Budd, this shit ain't
school, ya know.

Budd doesn't say anything, he just moves towards the back,

passing by a STRIPPER serving drinks.



STRIPPER
Hey, Budd.



BUDD
Hey, Lucky.

ANOTHER STRIPPER walks out of the ladies' room and says to
him;



STRIPPER
Hey, Budd, honey, the toilet's at
it again. There's shitty water all
over the floor.



BUDD
I'll take care of it, Suzie Pie.



EXT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

A brand new, enormous red pickup truck pulls into the parking
lot and stops.

The BRIDE
sits behind the wheel, looking at the bar and the bar's front
door. Using the rearview as a mirror, she grabs her long
blonde hair and pulls it back to a ponytail with a
rubberband. Then places a baseball cap on the top of her
noggin that reads, "STUBB'S BAR B-Q." She steps out of the
truck's cab. She's dressed like a little Texas two-stepper.
Levi's, cowboy boots, and a "HARLEY DAVIDSON: LOUD AND PROUD"
tee-shirt.



INT. THE MY-OH-MY-CLUB - NIGHT

The Bride walks into the club just as the band on stage
explodes into honky tonk guitar. She walks up to the bar and
oders a;



THE BRIDE
Shiner.

The BARTENDER gives her a beer bottle of Shiner Bock. As she
drinks the Texas brew...SHE....

...Watches the BAND....

...The crowd...

...Looking for Budd among the crowd...

...She sees him...

...He's the bouncer...

...She observes him...

...he's sitting on a stool, observing the crowd, moving his
head to the music...

SHAW BROTHERS ZOOM into her eyes; VENGEANCE THEME plays on
the soundtrack.

Her hand removes her sog from its sheath. She moves through
the crowd of Texas two-steppers, sog in hand, towards Budd
sitting oblivious on his stool....

WHEN...

Suddenly a BIG COWBOY stands up from his table -- spilling
every bottle and glass on it -- and BARFS all over.

Budd curses to himself, and heads over to the disaster area.

The Bride...observes Him...CLEAN UP THE PUKE.



EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

As the music from above continues, we see Budd driving his
pickup on an empty highway home from work.

He passes by The Bride's    new red pussy wagon parked on the
side of the road. After    he whizzes by, she starts up the
motor, but doesn't turn    the lights on. She follows him,
hanging way back in the    dark.

Budd driving, not seeing the automobile cloaked in darkness,
trailing him.



EXT. BUDD'S TRAILER HOME - NIGHT

Budd pulls his pickup truck in front of his small camper
home. He walks inside, shutting the door behind him.

The Bride rolls to a stop...Observing the lonely trailer out
of her windshield...

Texas tear-ass music begins coming out of the camper....We
see his figure pass the camper window, once or twice.

The Bride chooses her weapon -- Hattori Hanzo's samurai

sword.

She doesn't say anything, nor will an actress of Uma
Thurman's caliber indicate her feelings, but the astute
member of the audience will read the significance of her
choice. His current status be damned, the Budd who owes The
Bride satisfaction was a warrior. And it's that Budd she
intends to send to his maker.

She takes a black stocking cap, and slips it on top of her
skull, tucking her blonde hair underneath...

THEN...

...Rubs black make-up under both eyes, on top of both
eyelids, and down the bridge of her nose...

THEN...

Disconnects the cab lights above her, opens the truck door,
and slips out unseen into the Austin Texas night air.

THEN...

On her belly, Hattori Hanzo sword in sheath in hand, she
crawls across the desert floor towards Budd's trailer.

THEN...

Somewhere in the vast outdoors a cat jumps on a rat. Their
fight makes a LOUD racket.

The Bride stops and buries her face in the dirt.

From inside the trailer, we hear the needle being lifted off
the phonograph.

From a distance we see: The shadowy figure of Budd looking
out the window of the camper.

The Bride keeps her face in the dirt.

The figure of Budd at the window, seems to dismiss the sound
he heard for what it was -- a rat meeting its end at the
claws of a cat.

The curtain closes again.

The needle is placed back on the phonograph.

CU The BRIDE
face in the dirt...One Mississippi...Two Mississippi...her
eyes look up towards the trailer...All's clear...She begins
crawling towards the trailer again.

...She's now right outside the trailer home...We can hear the
sound of Budd sitting in a chair rocking back and forth.

She hears the sound of a screw top unscrewed...The sound of
pouring in a glass...The sound of a glass being laid heavy on

a table.

Crouched low on the balls of her feet, she, with great care,
slowly and silently unsheathes her Hanzo sword.

Through the bottom slit in the door, she sees the distorted
image of Budd's feet on the floor.

She slowly rises...removes her black stocking cap...blonde
hair falls around her shoulders...sword in right hand...left
hand grabs the front doorknob...

QUICK as a Texas lizard on glass -- She brings the sword's
handle down hard on the door lock --

EX CU Cheap Lock Busting.

She flings the front door open...

The BRIDE'S POV:
Brother Budd sitting calmly in a rocking chair, moving back
and forth to the Texas twang on his turntable, cradling a
DOUBLE-BARREL SHOTGUN aimed right at The Bride.

SERGIO LEONE CU:
The Bride Blinks.

Both barrels BLAST in our face.

The BRIDE
standing in the doorway is HIT SMACK DAB in the chest, and
PROPELLED THROUGH the AIR BACKWARDS.

Landing hard on her back in the dirt.

Budd casually rises from his rocking chair and lifts the
needle off the phonograph, cutting off the music.

Then with shotgun in hand, stands in the doorway of the
trailer looking down at The Bride.

BUDD'S POV:
The Bride laid out in the dirt below him -- Sword separated
from her grasp -- Bloody mess down her front -- Groan from
her throat.

Budd steps down from the trailer onto the dirt, standing over
The Bride.



BUDD
Bet your sweet ass that don't sting
like a bitch.

More groans coming out of The blood splattered Bride.



BUDD

You done got a double dose of rock
salt, right in the ole tit.
Now not havin tits as fine or as
big as yours, I can't even imagine
how bad that shit stings...

He lowers down on his haunchers, over her.



BUDD
...But I don't wont to neather.

The Bride, hurting and incapacitated from the shotgun blast,
still nevertheless defiant, SPITS a gob of bloody saliva,
right in ole Budd's face.

Budd, gob of spit running down on his cheek and nose. The
cowboy removes a red bandana from his back pocket, and wipes
away the goo. Then his eyeballs go down to the spitter.



BUDD
Now I know when it    comes to a rock
salt burn, you're    feelin pretty
much like a expert    bout now. But
truth be told, you    ain't felt all
rock salt's got to    offer till you
took a double dose    in your
backside.

With the help of his cowboy boot he rolls The Bride over onto
her stomach, exposing her butt.

SNAPPING the barrel closed, he takes aim and FIRES both
barrels -- EXECUTION STYLE -- right into her keister.

The Bride does the one thing she has yet to do with any
opponent during the movie up till now. Her head rears back
and she lets out a SCREAM!



BUDD
That gentled ya down, didn't it?
Yep...ain't nobody a badass with
two barrels of rock salt dug deep
in their backyard.

THEN...

Almost mercifully, the man once known as "Sidewinder," sticks
a syringe in her arm, dropping her unconscious.

THEN...

Knocking down a swig of Jack Daniels, he removes a small
silver cell phone from his pants pocket, raises the antenna,
and presses one button on the panel.

INT. ELLE DRIVER'S GYM - NIGHT

The six-foot tall, long-haired blonde with the codename
"California Mountain Snake," is doing a savage boxing workout
with her COACH.

This is one white bitch who can kick some serious FUCKIN ass.
With one mighty blow from her huge right arm (synched to the
sound of a CAR CRASH), her boxing Coach buys the farm.

Elle on cell phone. We cut Back and Forth.



ELLE
Bill?



BUDD
Wrong brother, you hateful bitch.



ELLE
....Budd?



BUDD
Bingo.



ELLE
And what do I owe this dubious
pleasure?



BUDD
I just caught me the cowgirl, ain't
never been caught.

This gets Elle's attention.



ELLE
Do you mean what I think you mean?



BUDD
If you think I mean I got 'er, you
thought right.

ELLE
Did you kill her?



BUDD
Not yet I ain't. But I can sure do
it easy enough. She's so gentle
right now, I could preform her coup
de grace with a rock.



ELLE
What are you waiting for, run outta
liquid courage.



BUDD
No. It's just...I ain't killed
nobody in a long Goddamn time. And
just 'tween you, me, and Jesus
Christ, kinda made me a promise I
wasn't gonna. Be that however it
is. Back when I did kill people...I
got paid for it. Just don't seem
right...turn amateur this time of
life.

We stay on Elle's side for the following exchange.



BUDD (O.S.)
Anywho, guess what I'm holdin in my
hand right now.

We cut back to Budd's side. And what he's holding is The
Bride's Hattori Hanzo sword.



BUDD
A brand spankin new Hattori Hanzo
sword. And I'm here to tell ya
Elle, that's what I call sharp.



ELLE
How much?



BUDD
Oh, that's hard to say. Seein it's
priceless and all.

ELLE
I'll give you a hundred thousand
dollars for it.



BUDD
I'm sure you would. But I'll take,
one million.



ELLE
Jeez Budd, who'd ever guess you
were such a capitalist. I thought
drunks like yourself were beyond
such monetary concerns?



BUDD
Well Elle, a million dollars buys a
whole lotta Jack.



ELLE
Why then are you selling it to a
hateful bitch like me, when you
know Bill would pay more?



BUDD
If I'm gonna drink myself to death,
...it won't be on Bill's dollar.
It's gonna be on yours.



ELLE
What's the terms?



BUDD
You buy a ticket to Texas, and I'll
see you here tomorrow mornin. You
give me a million in foldin cash,
I'll give you the greatest sword
ever made by a man. How's that
sound?



ELLE
Sounds like we got a deal. One

condition.



BUDD
What?



ELLE
You kill her tonight.
(pause)
And one more thing.



BUDD
You said one condition.



ELLE
It's a caveat to the same
condition.



BUDD
What?



ELLE
She must suffer to her last breath.



BUDD
That Elle darlin, I can pretty
damwell guarantee.



ELLE
Then I'll see you in the morning
millionaire.

CUT TO:



OVERHEAD SHOT - EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

We look down on a spooky Texas graveyard...
Tombstones...Graves...Dirt...Low-hanging fog. This could be
the opening shot of a Texas zombie movie. We also see TWO MEN
WITH SHOVELS (one which is Budd, the other which is ERNIE)
digging up a grave. Budd's beat-to-shit pickup is in the shot
too. Its headlight beams shining on the two men. And last but
not least, The Bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flatbed

of Budd's pickup.

The BRIDE
She begins to come to from the shot in her arm.
Some dried blood lies caked around her wounds. Rope binds her
wrists tightly together in front of her.

A big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her cherry
brown cowboy boots. Her eyelids flutter open...and she sees
stars. A giant, black Texas night sky full of them.

She has no idea where she is.

She turns her head to the left and sees,

Back window and Cab of truck.

She turns her head to the right and sees,

Hatch Gate to flatbed.

She listens...she hears,

Crickets...The sound of Two Men Digging...One of the Men says
something to the other in Spanish...

THEN...

She hears one of the Shovels HIT something buried...

The Two Men speak to each other in Unsubtitled Spanish...

THEN...

We hear them Lifting something heavy, we might assume is a
coffin. The Bride however knows not what to think.

BOOM...They set it down.

She hears boots approaching the flatbed, The crunching of
leaves leading in her direction...

TILL...

With a CLANG and a SCRAPE the latches on the Gate of the
flatbed are Yanked Out, and it lowers open with a CRASH.
Revealing Budd, looking down on her.



BUDD
Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey.

The grabs her by her collar, and yanks her out of the truck.

She FALLS to the dirt HARD.

Once in the dirt, The Bride sees an Old Coffin that's been
dup up.
Next to it is a brand new pine box coffin, straight out of

"Fistful of Dollars." And a freshly dug grave, with a pile of
dirt next to it, in front of an old tombstone that reads;
"PAULA SCHULTZ."

Budd and Ernie stand over her.

The Bride just GLARES up at the two tormentors, with the only
weapon she has left, the contempt in her stare.

Budd turns to Ernie and says in SPANISH, subtitled in
English;



BUDD (SPANISH)
Look at those eyes. This bitch is
furious. You grab her feet, I'll
get her head.
(ENGLISH)
Got anything to say?

The Bride knows how these fiends derive satisfaction, and she
won't give it to them.



BUDD (SPANISH)
In America white women call this
the silent treatment.
(laughing)
And we let 'em think, we don't like
it.

The two fiends laugh, then bend down to lift The Bride and
carry her over to the pine box. She struggles with her bound
legs and arms...Both men DROP her to the ground. Budd whips
out a can of mace from his pocket.



BUDD
Hey hey hey, wiggle worm, look at
this.

He holds the can of mace spray by her eyes. She stops. Her
eyes go to the nozzle of the spray can, then to Budd.



BUDD
Looky here bitch, this is a can of
mace. Now you're goin underground
tonight, and that's all there is to
it. But, when I bury ya, I was
gonna bury you with this.

He removes a flashlight from behind his back and turns on the
beam.

BUDD
But if    you're gonna act like    a
horse's    ass, I'll spray this    whole
Goddamn    can in your eyeballs.     Then
you'll    be blind, burnin, and    buried
alive.    So what's it gonna be
sister?

Her eyes move to the right, indicating the flashlight.



BUDD
You may be stupid, but at least you
ain't bloody stupid.

The two men lift up The Bride, and carry her over to the pine
box and place her in.

Budd puts the flashlight inside.

He picks up the pine lid, and is just about to place it over
the coffin...

WHEN...

...He locks eyeballs with The Bride...

...her eyes hold his for as long as she can,

THEN...

...he places the lid over her face, closing the coffin.

THEN...

...with a hammer and nails the two men seal the coffin shut.



INT. PINE BOX

Dark, excerpt for the cracks of light seeping through between
the lid and the box. However with each nail pounded in, more
lights is cut off...

TILL...

...the only light left, is the crack by The Bride's head. The
last hammered nail obliterates that light source.

The Bride lies in TOTAL DARKNESS.



EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

The two men lift the pine box, and set it in the grave.

Budd scoops up a shovel full of dirt...



INT. PINE BOX

EX CU HER FINGERS turn on the flashlight.

CU The BRIDE
LIT by the flashlight beam...

BAM...

...a shovel of dirt has just landed hard on the lid, making
The Bride jump...

BAM...

...More dirt. She reacts again.

BAM...

The dirt just keeps falling, the bams becoming softer with
each new shovelful.

The Bride is starting to perspire...her breathing becoming
more rapid and panicked...her heartbeat begins to echo inside
the pine box.

We've never seen her like this before.

She's starting to lose it...She lets out a SCREAM...She
SCREAMS again...Her bound-at-the-wrist hands move to the
lid...She pounds on it...Her bound feet kick up at it...She
starts to cry...She's getting hysterical...Her fingers begin
clawing at the wood lid...

TILL...

They're ripped open and bleeding...

Leaving Blood Trails on the wood.

TILL...

She exhausts herself. All this while, she's been screaming
the words we can't even imagine coming out of her mouth;



THE BRIDE
Help me.

The Bride halts her hysteria.

She wipes    her eyes, and runs her hands down her face,
mentally    sending the little girl she became, back to wherever
she came    from. The woman we know as The Bride is back. She
talks to    herself.

THE BRIDE
Well, now that you've had a nice,
good cry, let's figure out how to
get out of here? You're breathing
like you just been fuckin. Calm
down...close your mouth, and start
breathing short breaths, through
your nose.

She does. The Bride continues in VO;



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
That's a lot better. But you're
still too agitated. Can you hear
your heart? It's like I'm buried
alive with Buddy Rich. Turn off
that flashlight.

Fear comes into her voice as she combats herself.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
No! I can't turn off the light. Yes
you can. The darkness will have a
calming effect. Now turn off that
fucking light.

She does. The screen goes Jet Black



EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Budd and Ernie are finished filling the grave. The old
coffin, with the body of Paula Schultz, in the back of the
flatbed. Before they climb into the truck and drive away,
Budd lays a dozen red roses on The Bride's grave.



INT. BUDD'S TRAILER (MOVING) - NIGHT

Budd behind the wheel. Ernie in the passenger's seat. Car
radio playing Mexican music. Budd's silver cell phone rings.



BUDD

Yellow?



INT. AIRPLANE (FLYING) - NIGHT

Elle Driver sits in a seat on a passenger jet enroute to the
great state of Texas. She calls Budd on the airplane phone.



ELLE
Didja do it?



BUDD
Elle darlin, she's sufferin as we
speak.

A smile spreads across Elle's face. She rests her head back
against the seat's headrest. Her eyelids close. She slightly
parts her lips...and lets out a;

"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"

This is the face of satisfaction.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE UP ON



EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - CHINA - DAY

We see a beautiful mountain range in the middle of China.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS UNDERNEATH:


"SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF CHINA"

A VOICE OVER SPOKEN BY BILL, tells us a story over this
landscape;



BILL (V.O.)
Once upon a time in China, some
believe around the year, one-double
knot-three.

As Bill tells this story, it will be illustrated On Screen by
footage from Old Shaw Brothers Martial arts flicks of the
70's. Especially Films that feature Chinese Actor LO LIEH as
the old, white-haired, white-eyebrowed Villian "PAI MEI."

BILL (V.O.; CONT'D)
...head priest of The White Lotus
Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down the
road, contemplating whatever a man
with Pai Mei's infinite power would
contemplate -- Which is another way
of saying, who knows. When, a
Shaolin monk appeared on the road
traveling in the opposite
direction. As the monk and the
priest crossed paths...Pai Mei --
in a practically unfathomable
display of generosity, gave the
monk the slightest of nods. The
nod, was not returned. Was it the
intention of the Shaolin monk to
insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just
fail to see the generous social
gesture?
The motives of the monk, remain,
unknown. What is known, were the
consequences. The next morning Pai
Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple,
and demanded that the temple's head
Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to
repay the insult. The Abbot, at
first, tried to console Pai Mei,
only to find, Pai Mei was
inconsolable. So began, the
massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and
all sixty of the monks inside, at
the fists of the White Lotus. And
so began, the legend of Pai Mei's
Ten-Point Palm - Exploding Heart
Technique.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
What praytell, is a ten-point palm -
exploding heart technique?



BILL (V.O.)
Quite simply, the deadliest blow in
all of the martial arts. He hits
you with his fingertips, at ten
different pressure points on your
body. And then, he lets you walk
away. But once you've taken five
steps, your heart explodes inside
your body, and you fall to the
floor dead.

We see on screen Pai Mei demonstrate this technique on five
shaolin monks. Who after being hit...take five steps...then

fall to the floor dead.



EXT. JEEP (MOVING) - DAY

Bill and The Bride, years earlier, driving in a jeep through
the mountains of China, enroute to PAI MEI's.



THE BRIDE
Did he teach you that?



BILL
No. He teaches no one the ten-point
palm - exploding heart technique.
But he is Nietzsche's psalm
personified. If Pai Mei doesn't
kill you, he will make you
stronger. Now one of the things I
always liked about you, Kiddo, is
you appear wise beyond your years.
Then allow me to impart, a word to
the wise. Whatever - WHAT - EVER -
Pai Mei says, Obey. If you flash
him - even for an instant - a
defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.
And if you throw any American sass
his way, he will snap your back and
your neck like they were twigs, and
that will be the story of you.



EXT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY

The Bride sits in the jeep, by herself, parked in front of
the Priest Pai Mei's home located high up on top of White
Lotus Mountain.

For over 100 years, his home used to be the temple of the
White Lotus Clan, and he was the temple's head priest. The
temple served as a home to over 60 priests and disciples. But
now - the year 1990 - the White Lotus Clan is no more. All
the priests have died. All that remains, is a very old man,
who once upon a time, some worshipped as a god and some
feared as a devil...neither was wrong.

A huge stone staircase of one hundred steps climb up a hill
leading to Pei Mei's home. Bill climbs down to the jeep.



BILL
He'll accept you as his student.

THE BRIDE
Caught him in a good mood, aye?



BILL
More like a sadistic one.

She climbs out, and gets her bag out of the back.

Bill casts a glance at the stone steps he just decended.



BILL
Just seeing those steps again makes
me ache. You're gonna have plenty
of fun carrying buckets of water up
and down that fucker.



THE BRIDE
Why did he accept me?



BILL
Because he's a very very very old
man. And like all rotten bastards,
when they get old, they become
lonely. Not that that has any
effect on their disposition. But
they do learn the value of company.



THE BRIDE
When will I see you again?



BILL
That's the title of my favorite
soul song of the Seventies.



THE BRIDE
What?



BILL
Nothing. When he tells me you're
done.

THE BRIDE
When do you think that might be?



BILL
That my dearest, all depends on
you. Now remember, no backtalk, no
sarcasm.
Least not for the first year.
You're going to have to let him
warm up for you. He hates
Caucasians, despises Americans, and
has nothing but contempt for women,
so in your case, that may take a
little while. Adios.

ZOOM...

The jeep speeds off down the road...leaving the Bride all
alone, somewhere in the middle of China.

She begins the journey before her by ascending the 100 steps
to Pai Mei.



INT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE

The huge temple is exactly like it must have been a hundred
years ago, except now it's empty and dusty.

The Bride enters, She's winded from climbing up those fuckin
steps.



THE BRIDE
(yelling)
Hello!

Her Voice ECHOES in the cavernous temple.

PAI MEI's VOICE ECHOES back;



PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)
Up the stairs, yankee woman!

A beautiful (but dusty) Mahagony staircase leads to Pai Mei's
private chamber.



THE BRIDE
(to herself)
More stairs, Jesus Christ.

The still unseen Man's voice BOOMS back;

PAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.)
If it is Christ you seek, turn back
now.

She climbs the wooden staircase.



INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE CHAMBER

PAI MEI'S POV: We see through Pei Mei's pupils, through a
sheer scarlet scrim that hangs down in front of his sitting
area. The Bride enters the room.

She approaches the old man, reaches the edge of his sitting
area in front of the scrim, lowers to one knee and bows her
head.

  From here on end, whenever ENGLISH is spoken     by The Bride,
or every once in awhile by Pai Mei, it will be     spoken in
ENGLISH IN LIVE SYNCH SOUND. However, whenever     MANDARIN is
supposedly spoken, it comes out of their mouths     as DUBBED
ENGLISH like in a 70's Shaw Brothers Chop Socky     Flick.



THE BRIDE  
Teacher, I am unworthy to be your
student --

Pai Mei is still unseen.



PAI MEI'S VOICE  
Your Mandarin is lousy. I can't
understand a single word you say.
It causes my ears discomfort. You
are not to speak unless spoken to.
Do you understand Mandarin any
better than you speak it?



THE BRIDE  
I speak Japanese very well --



PAI    MEI'S VOICE  
I didn't ask    if you speak Japanese,
or Mongolian,    for that matter. I
asked if you    understand Mandarin?



THE BRIDE  

A little, I am still learning.



PAI MEI'S VOICE  
You are here to learn the mysteries
of Kung Fu, not linguistics. If you
can't understand me, I will
communicate with you like I would a
dog. When I yell, when I point,
When I beat you with my stick!

Her head remains bowed, eyes to the floor.

WE CUT TO PAI MEI
He's just like he was in the films earlier. Long White Hair,
Long White Beard, Long White Eyebrowes, same long flowing
White Robe. Everything's the same, except he's older, by
about a hundred years. He sits stone still in his sitting
area on the other side of the sheer scarlet scrim.



PAI MEI  
Bill is your master, is he not?



THE BRIDE  
Yes, he is.



PAI MEI  
Your master tells me you're not
entirely unschooled. What training
do you possess?



THE BRIDE  
I am proficient in a combination of
Tiger and Crane style. And I am
more than proficient in the
exquisite art of the Samurai Sword.



PAI MEI  
(he makes a SNORTING
SOUND)
The exquisite art of the samurai
sword. Don't make me laugh. Your so
called exquisite art, is only fit
for Japanese fat heads. You really
are a silly ass.

This brings up The Bride's eye...She GLARES at the old man.

PAI MEI  
Impudent dog! You dare glare at me!

She lowers her eyes.



THE BRIDE  
I'm sorry master --



PAI MEI  
-- Silence! I do not wish to hear
your unintelligible excuses.

Pause...

THEN...

Pai Mei softly LAUGHS to himself, and strokes his long white
beard...



PAI MEI  
Your anger amuses me. Do you
believe you are my match?



THE BRIDE  
No.



PAI MEI  
Are you aware I kill at will?



THE BRIDE  
Yes.



PAI MEI  
Is it your wish to die?



THE BRIDE  
No.



PAI MEI  
Then you must be stupid. Rise
stupid, and let me get a better

look at your ridiculous face.

She rises.

CU The BRIDE
through the scrim, eyes down.

Pai Mei laughs to himself again;



PAI MEI  
You breathe hard. The one hundred
steps robbed you of your wind. So
your stupidity is matched only by
your weakness. Is there anything
you do well? -- Oh yes, you speak
Japanese. I despise the Goddamn
Japs. I would of thought an
American would be immune to their
pompous posturing. Apparently I was
wrong. Go to that drawer.

The blonde woman goes to a large wooden drawer. She opens the
drawer; it's filled with just about every type of edged
weapon.



PAI MEI  
Remove the sword.

The Bride removes a large heavy steel Chinese Sword.

Pai Mei rises from his sitting position, for the first time,
parts the scrim, and approaches the Bride.



PAI    MEI  
Let's see how    good you really are.
Try and land    a blow. If you land a
single blow,    I'll bow down and call
you master.

The Bride doesn't need a second invitation, she ATTACKS with
the sword.

He deftly moves out of the way.

The fighting style is now like an old Shaw Brothers film,
with Pai Mei dodging at will all of her rapid sword slashes.

Quick and skillful as her moves are, they're also full of
Effort and Frustration. While Pai Mei effortlessly moves out
of the sword's path.

He's amused, and Speaks while they fight;

PAI MEI  
Come now woman, can't you even hit
an old man?

She tries more...



PAI MEI  
Your ability really is quite poor.

He STRIKES her with a blow to her chest, delivered with an
open palm, that sends her flying back hard against the wall.
She clutches her chest, and coughs up some blood.

Pai Mei laughs as he strokes his long white beard.



PAI MEI  
Ha ha ha ha ha! I've fought
cripples who posed more of a
challenge. Now fight, goddamn you!

She ATTACKS with a wild cat's fury.

He HOPS and DUCKS and DODGES her sword easily.

He LEAPS HIGH UP IN THE AIR, and LANDS STANDING on the Blade
of her Sword.

The Bride looks down the blade of her sword and can't believe
it.

Pai Mei smiles at her and says;



PAI MEI  
From here you can get an excellent
view of my foot.

He does a BACKFLIP off the sword, kicking the Bride in the
face in mid-somersault sending her CRASHING THROUGH A WOOD
WALL.

The Bride emerges from the hole in the wall.

Pai Mei stands waiting for her, TWIRLING THE SWORD in his
hand like a cheerleader twirling a baton, till the twirling
STOPS. The sword's handle is pointed towards the Bride.



PAI MEI  
Give up? Or care to try again?

The BRIDE'S FACE
shows determination. Not to win, not even to land a blow,

that she knows is impossible. This man's ability is truly
amazing. However be that as it may, she's determined not to
quit, and through not quitting, she's determined to
distinguish herself in his eyes...in some way.

She takes the sword from him and tries again.

But this time, Pai Mei keeps grabbing her arm that holds the
sword, manipulating it into positions that would do the young
girl harm...Like bringing the blade up against her other
arm...Poised to cut it Off.



PAI MEI  
That blade's sharp. Careful not to
cut off your own arm.

...Then he TWISTS her arm, till the blade's against her own
throat....

...Then TWISTS again till it's against her hip...

...Then TWISTS again while KICKING her leg, till the blade's
edge is against her thigh...



PAI MEI  
If you can't fight any better than
that, what use do you have for a
leg?

He lets go of her arms, she swings furiously at him...

...he calmly SPINS out of the way. Then, he KICKS her in the
stomach, doubling her over, then he brings the Sword between
her legs, Blade Edge against her Crotch.



PAI MEI  
Now that really would be a shame.

He takes the sword from her grasp...

SWINGS once...

The BLADES's against her jugular.

He SWINGS twice...

The BLADE's against the pocket of her throat.

He SWINGS a third time...

The BLADE's against the nipple of her right breast.

PAI MEI  
Your swordsmanship is amateur at
best.

He tosses the sword in the air, catching it by the tip of the
blade. Then like a mallet, brings the handle end down hard on
the top of The Bride's head. She lets out a howl, and falls
to the floor, holding the lump on her noggin.



PAI MEI  
I'm a hundred and fifty years old,
and you can't even make me break a
sweat.

He CHOPS the sword in half with his hand.



PAI MEI  
Let's see your Tiger and Crane
style match my Eagles's Claw.

Again she ATTACKS...again he eludes.

Like a Gordon Liu and Lo Lieh film, they do their animal
style martial arts dance.

As she STRIKES and he BLOCKS...he yells out;



PAI MEI  
...pathetic.....terrible...you
idiot, you should've landed that
blow...you call that crane?...
Enough, I grow bored.

With little effort on his part, he reaches out and GRABS her
wrist, TWISTS...She's on the floor, with her arm stuck out in
the air behind her, her wrist still between his fingers. He
could literally break her arm in half.



PAI MEI  
I asked you to show me what you
know, and you did. Not a goddamn
thing.

He TWISTS her wrist...

...The pain is excruciating.....



PAI MEI  
Like all yankee women, the only
thing you know how to do is order

in restaurants and spend a man's
money.

He TWISTS more...

She CRIES OUT.



PAI MEI  
Excruciating isn't it? I asked you
a question!

Through gritted teeth, she answers;



THE BRIDE  
Yes!



PAI MEI  
I could chop off your arm at will.
I think I shall.

He raises his other hand to chop off her arm.

The Bride SCREAMS in ENGLISH;



THE BRIDE
No please don't!



PAI MEI  
If you wish to speak romantic
languages, you've come to the wrong
place.



THE BRIDE  
Please don't cut my arm off!



PAI MEI  
It's my arm now. I can do with it
what I please. If you can stop me,
I suggest you try.



THE BRIDE  
I can't!

PAI MEI  
Because you're helpless?



THE BRIDE  
Yes!



PAI MEI  
Have you ever felt this before?



THE BRIDE  
No!



PAI MEI  
Compared to me you're as helpless
as a worm fighting an eagle, aren't
you?



THE BRIDE  
Yes!!!



PAI MEI  
THAT'S THE BEGGING!

He lets go of her wrist. She cradles her still-throbbing arm.



PAI MEI  
Is it your wish to learn how to
make others as helpless as you
were?



THE BRIDE  
Yes.



PAI MEI  
Can you cook?



THE BRIDE  
Yes.

PAI MEI  
I'll be the judge of    that.
(pause)
Draw me a bath...your    training will
begin tomorrow. That    arm is still
mine. You may lose it    yet.

TIME CUT



EXT. WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY

Pai Mei stands in front of a wood wall three inches in front
of him. His right fist is cocked back by his breastplate,
he's concentrating on a certain spot on the wall.

The Bride stands behind him, watching.

He lets out a SCREAM, and puts his fist THROUGH THE WALL.

He turns to the new student;



PAI MEI  
Since your arm now belongs to me, I
want it strong. Can you do that?



THE BRIDE  
I can, but not that close.



PAI MEI  
Then you can't do it.



THE BRIDE  
I can put my hand through that at
six inches.



PAI MEI  
And you could shoot a man from a
rooftop with a scope-sight rifle,
if you so desired, but this is not
what I asked. What if your enemy is
three inches in front of you, what
do you do then? Curl into a ball?
Or do you put your fist through
him.

He HITS the wall again leaving another hole.

PAI MEI  
Now begin.

The Bride takes her place in front of the wall. She HITS it.
Only managing to stain the wall with the blood from her
scraped knuckles. Then again. And again....



INT. DINNER TABLE - NIGHT

Both Pai Mei    and The Bride sit at the dinner table. Pai Mei
concentrates    on eating. The Bride's hand is scraped bloody.
She tries to    eat a bowl of rice with chopsticks, but her
fingers won't    work. She puts down the sticks and takes a
scoop of rice    with her fingers.

Pai Mei WHACKS her on top of her head with his stick.



PAI MEI  
If you want to eat like a dog, I
will make you live and sleep like a
dog. Outside. If you want to live
and sleep like a human being, pick
up those sticks.

She does.



THE WOOD WALL

The Bride HITTING it.

She looks at her fucked-up hand, then to the wall,
hesitating....Then Pai Mei's behind her.



PAI MEI  
It's the wood that       should fear your
hand, not the other       way around. No
wonder you can't do       it, you
acquiesce to defeat       before you even
begin.

He walks off in a huff.



EXT. PIT - DAY

Pai Mei and The Bride stand at the edge of a large, round
deep pit, dug in the earth (by the Bride).

PAI MEI  
In that pit, is a rat.

We see one lone rat in the huge pit.



PAI MEI  
In the sky, is a bird.

Pai Mei brings a golden bow and arrow into Frame, and SHOOTS
up in the sky.

A BIRD FALLS to the earth with a golden arrow stuck through
it.



PAI MEI  
You are to go into that pit, and
catch that rat, with your bare
hands. If you catch the rat, I will
deem you the victor, and tonight
you will dine on bird. But, if you
can't catch the rat by sundown,
I'll deem the victor the rat. And
because of the disgrace to my
student, I will be forced to kill
it. And then I will force you, to
consume his body. Because to be my
student, you must develop a taste
for victory.

She hops into the pit, gets down on the ground, lock eyes
with her rodent opponent, and goes after it.

The BRIDE
Practicing her Tiger Crane combo Kung Fu.

MORE wall....

At NIGHT punching the wall in front of her in her sleep.

Trying to catch the rat to no avail.

WHEN...

A golden arrow kills the rat.

She looks up and sees Pai Mei, golden bow in his hand,
looking down on her. It's sundown.

She stands, dusting herself off (she's dirty from the chase)
and looks at her teacher.

She picks her dead foe up from the earth, and removes the
golden arrow. Then with the rat in her hand, she looks up to
her teacher.

THE BRIDE  
I acknowledge defeat at the paws of
this rat. However, I will not eat
this filthy vermin. What I will
do...
(she RIPS the rat open
like a pomegranate)
...is consume his victorious heart.
(she snatches the tiny
heart from the rodent's
carcass. Holding it
between her fingers.)
But tomorrow, you kill a big bird.

She POPS the tiny rat heart in her mouth, and begins to chew.

Pai Mei looking down on her, says;



PAI MEI  
How does victory taste?



THE BRIDE  
Bitter.

We do a Shaw Brothers ZOOM into a CU on Pai Mei, he gives an
affirmative NOD and GRUNT.

The BRIDE'S FIST
goes through the wall.



THE BRIDE
(to herself)
Wow!



INT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE BATHROOM - DAY

Pai Mei splashing by himself in his huge bathtub, when he
hears a noise.



PAI MEI  
Woman, is that you who disturbs my
meditation?

She answers from outside the door;

THE BRIDE'S VOICE (O.S.)
Yes, teacher.



PAI MEI  
Enter.

She does, bowing to one knee.



PAI MEI  
What news do you find so worthy, as
to disrupt my bath?



THE BRIDE  
I did it teacher. I put my fist
through the wall.

TIME CUT

PAI MEI and the BRIDE
looking at the hole in the wall.



PAI MEI  
Very good. Would you care to
demonstrate?

She moves in front of the wall.....Takes her position...Her
right hand in a fist -- Locked and loaded into position....
With Her left hand she reaches out and touches the wall where
she'll strike....Like she's transferring her energy into the
wood...She removes her left hand...and...STRIKES!

She hits it HARD, but her fist doesn't go through.

Her eyes sneak a look at the old man, who wears no
expression.



THE BRIDE  
I think you watching is making me
nervous.



PAI MEI  
Not only that, it has you speaking
before you were spoken to. Try
again.

She does.

And when she does, she DOES it.

CU PAI MEI
he says in ENGLISH;



PAI MEI
Impressive.

She immediately goes down to her knees;



THE BRIDE  
Thank you teacher --

He just as immediately, lifts her back up.



PAI MEI  
You still fight better than you
speak. Finally, a woman who
understands what's important.

THEN...

He MOVES the wall one inch in front of her.



PAI MEI  
Begin again.

Then the old man leaves to finish his bath.

The blonde gal begins again....Fist against wood...no
effect....starting all over.

CUT TO:



BACK TO COFFIN, SIX FEET UNDER

PITCH BLACK -- The Flashlight Beam turns on. CU The BRIDE in
Profile. Her breathing is normal. We can hear the soft beat
of her heart inside the pine box. Her composure is back.

Taking the flashlight, she Shines the beam on the lid above
her....Along the line of the coffin's rim and the lid where
many nails meet....Then down to her Red Cowboy Boots, bound
by a leather belt around her.

Raising her knees, as much as the coffin will allow, and
wiggling her feet, she slips her bare feet our of the boots
and the belt's binding...Then, using her bare feet, then her
bound-at-the-wrist hands, to pass one of the boots up to
her...When the red boot is in her grasp, she turns it upside
down....The STRAIGHT RAZOR falls out.

Opening the razor, she slices through the ropes that tie her
wrists, till both hands are free.

She positions the flashlight so its Beam Shines on the coffin
lid. The lid's about an inch and a half from the tip of her
nose, about three inches from her hand.

THEN...

AS COMBAT DRUMS BEGIN TO BEAT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, she begins
to concentrate. Her eyes focus on the wood above her, her
left hand reaches out, touches the pine, passing her energy
to it...

...Her long, white fingers, ball up into a FIST....

...and that FIST begins STRIKING the coffin lid above her.

With each Strike she lets out a KARATE SCREAM...

AGAIN...

And AGAIN...

Her FIST SMASHES into the wood, leaving BLOOD on the lid...

AGAIN...

And AGAIN...

A crack in the lid...

AGAIN...

Dirt begins to sift through the cracks onto the Bride...

AGAIN...

More dirt...

AGAIN...

Even more dirt...

AGAIN...

THE LID SMASHES and dirt pours into the coffin like water...

THEN...

Through six feet of dirt, we watch, the Bride - DIG - CLIMB -
SWIM - SPROUT - BURROW - trough the earth like a sprouting
plant and a burrowing mole combined, clawing for surface air.



EXT. PAULA SCHULTZ'S GRAVE - NIGHT

A SHOT straight out of an Italian horror film. We see the

tombstone of "PAULA SCHULTZ," and the mound of dirt over her
grave.

WHEN...

The Bride's hand breaks the surface...then like one of
Fulci's Zombies, Claws, Digs, and Pulls herself from mother
earth's womb.

Once extracted from her (almost) final resting place, she
rolls over on her back, exhausted. She drinks in the night's
air as if it were gulps of water.

DIRT is in, on, and under every crack, crevice, and wrinkle
on her body.

SHE looks like a beautiful sculpture, made out of dirt.



INT. DINER - NIGHT

A Texas diner across the street from the graveyard. A YOUNG
SODA JERK stands behind the counter, waiting for a customer,
when he sees something approaching through the restaurant's
big picture window that makes him look twice.

SODA JERK'S POV:
Through the picture window, we see the Bride, emerge from the
Texas night, and walk towards the diner looking for all the
world like a six-foot tall female version of the Peanuts
character "PIG PEN." With each of her footfalls, a smaller
mushroom cloud of dust comes off her.

The dirty blonde, walks into the diner, sits on a stool at
the counter directly across from the Soda Jerk, and says;



THE BRIDE
I'd like a glass of water.

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. DESERT BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

The car stops in front of Budd's camper. She shuts off the
car and the radio.

The camper door opens, Budd squints outside through the
bright gold, hot desert morning, at the Tall Blonde Girl with
one Good Eye.



BUDD
Want some breakfast?



INT. BUDD'S CAMPER'S KITCHEN - DAY

Budd and Elle in the tiny kitchen of Budd's tiny camper. Elle
sits a the kitchen table, a black suitcase by her feet. Budd
stands at a blender making them both breakfast margaritas, as
he finishes telling the tale of last night.



ELLE
...So that's called a Texas
funeral?



BUDD
Yep.



ELLE
I got to give it to ya Budd, that's
a pretty fucked up way to die.
What's the name on the grave she's
buried under?



BUDD
Paula Schultz.

Budd turns on the NOISY blender, as Elle writes down the    name
Paula Schultz on a small notepad, placing it back inside    her
pocket. As the blender MASHES ICE, Elle looks around and    sees
the Bride's Hanzo sword in its sheath, leaning up against    the
T.V. In the front room. Budd shuts the blender off.



ELLE

Can I look at the sword?



BUDD
That's my money in that black case,
isn't it?



ELLE
Sure is.



BUDD
Well then, it's your sword now.

The tall blonde girl steps into the living room, takes the
Hanzo sword, and sits back down on the kitchen chair.

She slowly removes the Japanese steel from its wood sheath.



ELLE
So this, is a Hattori Hanzo sword.

Budd answers as he fills up two former peanut butter jars
with breakfast margaritas.



BUDD
That's a Hanzo sword alright.



ELLE
Bill tells me you once had one of
your own.

Pause.



BUDD
Once.



ELLE
How does this one compare to that
one?



BUDD
If you're gonna compare a Hanzo
sword, you compare it to every

sword ever made -- wasn't made by
Hattori Hanzo. Here, wrap your lips
around this.

He hands her her margarita, she takes a sip. He takes a gulp.



BUDD
So, which "R" you filled with?



ELLE
What?



BUDD
They say the number one killer of
old people is retirement. People
got'em a job to do, they tend to
live a little longer so they can do
it. I've always figured warriors
and their enemies share the same
relationship. So now you ain't
gonna hafta face your enemy on the
battlefield no more, which "R" are
you filled with, Relief or Regret?



ELLE
A little bit of both.



BUDD
Bullshit. I'm sure you do feel a
little bit of both. But I know damn
well you feel one more than you
feel the other. The question was
which one?

Elle looks right at him with her eye, and says;



ELLE
Regret.



BUDD
Yeah you gotta hand it to the ol'
girl. I never saw nobody buffalo
Bill the way she buffaloed Bill.
Bill useta think she was so damn
smart. I tried to tell him... Bill,
she's just smart for a blonde.

He looks over at Elle and grins.

Elle looks at him.



ELLE
Want your money?

She gestures to the black suitcase by her feet.

He smiles and lifts it up on the table, unzipping it open.

Lying inside is a cool million, the thousand dollar bills are
inside stacks of a hundred thousand each. At the sight of all
this lettuce, Budd lets out a whistle.



BUDD
Great day in the morning.

He lifts a stack out of the bag, then another, then
another...and when he lifts the third stack out, he looks
down and sees a BLACK MAMBA SNAKE coiled underneath.

The Black Mamba opens its WIDE JAWS...and LEAPS RIGHT AT
BUDD...

...STRIKING Budd in the face repeatedly in blurred succession
(three times in the face, and once in the forearm).

Budd topples out of the kitchen chair onto the floor, bundles
of money fall with him.

Elle takes a sip of her Margarita.

The Black Mamba leaves Budd and goes under the refridgerator.

Elle looks down, Budd    lies on his back on the kitchen floor
at her feet. His face    is already grotesquely swollen and
white as a sheet. The    serpent's extraordinarily potent venom
makes a full-frontal    assault on the cowboys's nervous system.



ELLE
Oh, I'm sorry Budd, that was rude
of me wasn't it? Budd -- I'd like
to introduce my friend, The Black
Mamba.
(gesturing towards the
refridgerator)
Black Mamba -- this is Budd. You
know before I picked up that little
fella, I looked him up on the
internet.
(she removes her notepad
from her pocket)

Fascinating creature the Black
Mamba. Listen to this,
(reading from the notepad)
"...In Africa, the saying goes, in
the bush, an elephant can kill you.
A leopard can kill you. And a Black
Mamba can kill you. But only with
the Mamba, and this has been true
in Africa since the dawn of time,
is death sure. Hence its handle;
Death Incarnate."
(looking up from the
paper)
Pretty cool, huh?
(back to paper)
"...Its neurotoxic venom is one of
nature's most effective poisons,
acting on the nervous system
causing paralysis. The venom of a
Black Mamba can kill a human in
four hours, if say bitten on the
ankle or the thumb. However, a bite
to the face or torso can bring
death from paralysis within twenty
minutes.
(up from paper to Budd)
Now you should listen to this cause
this concerns you.
(reading from the paper)
The amount of venom that can be
delivered from a single bit can be
gargantuan.
(looks up from paper)
-- You know I've always liked that
word Gargantuan, and I so rarely
have an opportunity to use it in a
sentence.
(back to paper)
"If not treated quickly with anti
venom, 10 to 15 milligrams can be
fatal to human beings. However, the
Black Mamba can deliver as much as
100 to 400 milligrams of venom from
a single bite."

Elle finishes reading and puts the paper away. She looks down
at Budd at her feet, going through all the symptoms she just
described.



ELLE
Now in these last agonizing minutes
of life you have left, let me
answer the question you asked
earlier, more thoroughly. When it
comes to that bitch, I gotta lotta
"R's" in me. Revenge is one.
Retribution is another. Rivalry is
definitely one. But I got another

"R" for that bitch you might be
surprised to find out. Respect. But
right at this moment, the biggest
"R" I feel, is Regret. Regret that
maybe the greatest warrior I have
ever met, met her end at the hands
of a bushwhackin, scrub, alacky
piece of shit like you. The woman
deserved better.

Budd, dying, watches from the floor as Elle takes out her
cell phone and presses one button. The other party comes on
the line, but we never hear their side.



ELLE
(into phone)
Bill...Elle. I have some tragic
news.
(pause)
Your brother's dead.
(pause)
I'm sorry baby.

Budd tries to make a sound from the floor, Elle calmly places
her foot over his mouth.



ELLE (CONT'D)
She put a Black Mamba in his
camper.
(pause)
I got her, sweety.
(pause)
She's dead.
(pause)
Let me put it this way. If you ever
start feeling sentimental, go to
Austin, Texas. When you get here,
walk into a florist and buy a bunch
of flowers. Then you take those
flowers to Huntington cemetery on
Fuller and Guadalupe, look for the
headstone marked "Paula Schultz",
then lay them on the grave. Because
you will be standing at the final
resting place of BEATRIX KIDDO.

No no no no no, you need me baby.

(pause)
Okay, I'm leaving now, go smoke
some pot or something. I'll be

She hangs up the cell phone, and looks down at the dead man
under her shoe.

Picking up the Hanzo sword, she climbs down on the floor on
her hands and knees to pick up the fallen money.

CU The BLACK MAMBA
out from under the refrigerator, behind Elle...

Elle senses it. And slowly turns her head to look back..

Both Black Mamba and Elle Driver LOCK EYES...

ZOOM INTO BOTH CU's tighter and tighter, till Elle says;



ELLE
Bring it on, bitch.

The viper known as death incarnate, LEAPS at Elle.

Elle flicks her wrist slightly. She doesn't even swing the
blade. She just holds it.

The snake's head touches it, and is immediately SEPARATED
from its body.

ELLE'S EYES look down at the Japanese steel in her hand.

HANZO BLADE
a smidgen of crimson blood is on the silver steel.



ELLE
Now that's what I call sharp.



EXT. BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

Elle exits the camper with both the sword and the black
suitcase in her hand.

She climbs into her gold and black Trans Am, starts up the
engine, turns on the radio....

WHEN...

...she thinks she hears something...she looks out her
driver's side car door window...

ELLE'S POV:
The dirty BLONDE BRIDE behind the wheel of her new, enormous
red pickup truck, HEADING RIGHT FOR HER...

CU The BRIDE

CU ELLE
her jaw drops open. She's gobsmacked. Not only does she see
the dead walk, she sees the dead behind two tons of metal
coming at her at 100 MPH...

CRASH

The Red Pickup T-BONES the Trans Am, the gold and black car
FLIES through the air, then ROLLS OVER AND OVER about five
times in the desert sand and dirt...ending upside down.

The dirty blonde looks out her windshield at the wreckage of
the black and gold sports car. A smile with the slightest
hint of satisfaction, spreads across her face.

She hops out of the truck and into Budd's camper.

INT. BUDD'S CAMPER - DAY

As she walks through the door, Budd's dead, swollen body
greets her. As does her serpent namesake, dead on the floor
from decapitation.

She begins searching the camper, quickly, for something in
particular. We don't have the slightest clue what it could
be.

The BRIDE'S POV:
She watches from a high perch, Budd practicing with a ...
SAMURAI SWORD.

The BRIDE
searching under his bed, she sees a sword on the floor,
resting in a shiny, black wood mahagony sheath. She removes
it from its hiding place.

WOOD SHEATH
Its one of Hanzo's sheaths. She opens it. It is a Hanzo
sword. Near the handle, etched in the steel, are the English
words; "To My Brother Budd, The Only Man I Ever Loved, from
Bill."

She closes the sheath, this will do. She sees a pair    of
cowboy boots. Picks one up and places the sole of the    boot
against the sole of her foot. Her feet and this man's    boot
are around the same size. She slips her dirty feet in    them.

She's good to go.



EXT. DESERT

Elle crawls from the wreckage of the Trans Am, holding the
Hanzo sword, looking like she's just been in a car wreck.

A cut on her head makes blood run down the side of her face.
Luckily for her, not the side with the good eye.

The camper door swings open. The Bride emerges from Budd's
home, looking like a Barbie doll that's been dug up after ten
years buried in the backyard, carrying a Hanzo sword. Every
footfall creating a cloud of dust.

The two women, each carrying a samurai sword, face each other
in showdown position.

A shark smile spreads across Elle's face.



ELLE
Bravo, Bea. I actually thought that
alacky had got the best of you.



THE BRIDE
You thought wrong.

The Bride unsheaths her sword with great flourish.

Elle does the same.



ELLE
(referring to the sword)
What's that?



THE BRIDE
Budd's Hanzo sword.



ELLE
He said he pawned it.



THE BRIDE
Guess that makes him a liar, don't
it?

Without raising their swords into position, the two blonde
warriors circle each other.



THE BRIDE
(question)
Elle?

ELLE
(answer)
Bea.



THE BRIDE
I was wondering, just 'tween us
girls, what did you say to Pai Mei
for him to snatch out your eye?

FLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE
of Pai Mei SNATCHING out Elle's eye with his Eagle's Claw.



ELLE
I called him a bastard.



THE BRIDE
Oooh, not so good.



ELLE
Were I to do it over again, I'd
bite my tongue.



THE BRIDE
One more question?



ELLE
Shoot.



THE BRIDE
Where's Bill?



ELLE
Villa Quatro.



THE BRIDE
Gulf of Mexico?

Elle nods her head 'yes.'

THE BRIDE
You wouldn't lie to me now?



ELLE
Why lie?

Elle raises up The Bride's Hanzo sword into position.

The Bride raises up her sword.



THE BRIDE
I saw what you did to that little
Mamba in there. Want to try that on
somebody your own size?




ELLE
I intend to.

The Bride completely drops her sword stance and her samurai
bearing.



THE BRIDE
Oh    Elle,   I    should warn   you    before
we get started. Hattori Hanzo
swords are extremely sharp. They
can    take   a    little   getting    used   to.
Careful not to cut your own arm
off.



ELLE
I don't rattle, bitch!

The Bride brings her sword back into combat position.



THE BRIDE
You're gonna bleed though, you're
gonna bleed a lot.

THEN...

SPAGHETTI WESTERN MUSIC EXPLODES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

The two blonde warriors....swords in position...no longer
circle each other....but instead move forward...closer and
closer to each other....one baby step at a time...

CU OF GIRLS.

EX CU'S OF:

Their separate GRIPS on the SWORD'S HANDLE.

Their FEET moving closer.

The Bride's eye.

Elle's eye.

The Tips of each other's Blade.

Their Blonde Hair.

As the Operatic Spaghetti Western Music Builds to a
crescendo...we CUT BACK AND FORTH between CU's of the two
women that get TIGHTER AND TIGHTER as we ZOOM in CLOSER and
CLOSER....UNTIL...We reach the THEME'S CLIMAX....

Both women let loose with a    Samurai Grunt and Swing.

EX CU: TWO SILVER BLADES CLASH.

EX CU: BLONDE HAIR WHIPPING.

EX CU: TWO SILVER BLADES CLASH AGAIN.

TWO SHOT: The TWO WOMEN WARRIORS stand their ground, STRIKING
and DEFENDING...When they stop, no one's been touched.

The TWO WOMEN - Swords in attack position - stare across to
the other one, as they prepare for their next attack...

Now they begin to circle again.

CU THEIR FEET making a circular walk.

They ATTACK...

EX CU BLADES MEET -- However this time we don't know who's on
the left or the right. One Blade maneuvers around the other.

EX EX CU: of TIP OF BLADE SLICING OPEN SKIN, about a quarter
of an inch. It looks like a scalpel cut. No blood. Just skin
separating. We don't know who's cut.

The TWO WOMEN stand and face each other. Neither knows if
it's them who has been struck. Neither woman bleeds.

We feel a count of...One Mississippi...

EX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE, clean as a whistle.

EX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE with a smudge of CRIMSON BLOOD on its
TIP.

We feel a count of Two Mississippi...

ELLE,

BLOOD begins to PROJECTILE SPRAY out of a slice in Elle's
neck only a quarter of an inch long. The Blood does not exit
the neck as liquid but as a FINE RED MIST, like that of an
aerosol can, we even HEAR the slight SPRAY WHISTLE. Elle
feels nothing. She turns her eyes towards the sound of the
spray, and sees the blood escaping her like air from a
balloon. She lifts her hand and places it in the path of the
spray, it's immediately BATHED IN RED.

Elle drops the Bride's sword.

As her blood continues to escape, both women look across each
other.

The effect is that Elle Driver is a balloon and her life is
escaping before both their very eyes. And now looking across
at each other, the two women see the other for the first
time, not as adversaries, or opponents, or as rivals, or as
bitches...but as sisters.

Elle no longer has enough life in her to stand up...She falls
to her knees in front of The Bride....

...then as she dies, she leans the side of her head against
The Bride's standing body. Her blood runs down The Bride's
leg. As she passes on, Elle gently wraps her arms around the
Bride's leg.

The Bride's hands go down to Elle's long blonde hair, and
begins gently stroking it, easing her pain as she expires.

Only in death do they find the sisterhood that could have
been theirs.

WIDE SHOT
The Bride standing, Elle on her knees, the desert surrounds

INT. BILL'S HACIENDA - DAY

Bill on the patio of his beautiful hacienda home (named Villa
Quatro) located on the beach in Mexico. At the moment Bill
partaking of his current hobby......Flower Arranging.

With his hands among various flowers of BRIGHT COLORS, he
sorts and prunes a very pretty arrangement.

EX CU the BRIDE'S EYE
....watching....

Bill's Mexican housekeeper, JOSEPHINA, appears on the patio.



JOSEPHINA
Mr. Bill, you wanted me to tell you
to leave now.



BILL
(finishing up)
Yes, I got to go and meet the
Duchess.
(referring to the flowers)
Do you like it?



JOSEPHINA
Oh yes Mr. Bill, it's very pretty.



BILL
Why don't you put it on the dinner
table, so we can enjoy it tonight.



JOSEPHINA
(she takes it)
Good idea, she'll love it.

As he heads out the patio, he tells her;



BILL
Oh and Josephina, take the
remaining flowers and spread them
around the house, if you would.

JOSEPHINA
Yes, Mr. Bill.

He exits the patio, then turns around and pops his head back
in.



BILL
You know I just had a great idea.
Take the roses, and spread the
petals on the bed I just got for
her. That'd be a nice thing to come
home to, wouldn't it, a bed of
roses.



JOSEPHINA
Oh, she'll love that Mr. Bill.



BILL
You wouldn't mind doing that for
me, would you Josephina?



JOSEPHINA
No, not at all.

every time we cut to it. Over the SHOTS OF BILL DRIVING we
hear a SPANISH TRAGIC LOVE BALLAD, coming from the car radio.

Dirt Road, lined by greener than green trees, the Porsche

CU BILL
driving as the Spanish love song plays.

The Bride's eye.

A striking but antiseptic-looking INSTITUTION of some sort,
surrounded by the beautiful foliage of Mexico. Bill's silver
Porsche drives up its driveway.

The Bride's eye.



INT. INSTITUTION

The institution is not Spanish in style, but on the contrary
it's a clinical new-age box-like structure made up of clear
glass doors and walls and the color beige.

Bill walks through the glass doors, to a lone Asian FEMALE
RECEPTIONIST, her desk is the only furniture in the lobby. In
JAPANESE he explains to her his reason for being there.

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYE
...watching...we now leave any shot of Bill not from the
Bride's perspective. The SUSPENSE THEME is STRETCHED TIGHTER
and TIGHTER as we look through the Bride's POV and listen to
her VO;



THE    BRIDE (V.O.)
The attentive    audience members
among you will    have probably
noticed, that    all my kills have
been straight    up fights.

The Bride's POV: The Glass-enclosed Institution, and Bill
standing by himself in the empty lobby.



THE BRIDE (V.O.)
Y'all figured I'd face him with my

Hanzo sword, aye? Well, I figured
Bill figured the same thing. I am
the product of three godfathers.
Bill, Pai Mei, and Hattori Hanzo.
Different teachers teach you
different things. But one thing I
learned from all three, was "in
combat, the opponent that does the
unexpected, can usually expect to
be the victor." Bill would never
see this coming. Not from me. And
least any of you judge me a
bushwhacker, remember...It was Bill
who taught me how to shoot.

As the Bride has said these things, WE'VE seen    INSERTS of her
putting together her high-powered scope rifle.    Snapping on
the scope sight. Setting the FOCUS through the    CROSSHAIRS.
Loading the heavy-duty AMMO. Curling her long    white finger
around the rifle's TRIGGER.

SCOPE SIGHT POV: Bill's head in between the Crosshairs.
SUSPENSE THEME is STRETCHED TIGHTER STILL...it will soon
break.

WIDE SHOT
looking through the Institution's glass wall. The elevator in
the lobby opens...and A LITTLE GIRL steps out, and runs into
Bill's arms. A LITTLE GIRL about five years old. A FIVE-YEAR
OLD LITTLE GIRL with blonde hair. Bill picks up the Little
Girl and lifts her HEAD into the CROSSHAIRS of the SCOPE
SIGHT.

SUSPENSE THEME SNAPS into an OPERATIC WAIL...

EX CU: The Bride's finger, pops off the trigger.

EX CU: The Bride's eye, A HUGE TEAR FALLS OUT...We move out
of the eyeball, into a MEDIUM CU of The Bride, tears falling
down her face...She can't believe what she's looking
at...that's her daughter...She's alive...

Her REMEMBERING THEME PLAYS...

FLASH ON
The Bride remembering, while she was in her wide-eyed coma
state, lying on an operating table, as DOCTORS AND NURSES
performed a Cesarean childbirth on her. The NEWBORN INFANT is
passed to other hands above her wide-eyed unblinking
expressionless face.

CU of The BRIDE
In one moment, Bill has managed to suddenly change the game.



EXT. LONG LONG LONG EMPTY ROAD IN MEXICO - DAY

Silence, except for a few birds.

THEN...

WE HEAR the Roaring of an Engine, and the Silver Porsche
WHIZZES into FRAME.



INT. PORSCHE (MOVING) - DAY

Bill behind the wheel, his little girl asleep in the
passenger seat. He sees something ahead.

A convertible Volkswagen Karman Ghia enters the road heading
in the opposite direction. It's a long long long way off, but
it will get closer every second.

Bill senses something about this automobile, and throws a
glance at his sleeping child.

His cell phone RINGS, he answers it.



BILL
Hola.



INT. THE BRIDE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

The Bride behind the wheel of the convertible, her long
blonde hair whipping in the wind, talks to Bill for the first
time in five years and six months.



THE BRIDE
Hello Bill.



BILL
Kiddo, is that really you?



THE BRIDE
Oh, it's me all right.



BILL
I hear you were driving a truck?



THE BRIDE
My pussy wagon died on me. Who's
your little friend?

He glances down at the sleeping child.



BILL
Oh, you mean the little tow head
next to me, who looks
extraordinarily like you?



THE BRIDE
Yeah, that one.



BILL
Her name is B.B.

The Bride gets choked up again, emotion betrays her voice.



THE BRIDE
B.B.?



BILL
Yes. Do you approve?

She wipes her eyes. Her hand moves under her shirt,
fingertips rest on scar.



THE BRIDE
Yes. Can she hear us?



BILL
Not now, she's in dream land.



THE BRIDE
How old is she?



BILL
What do you mean by that?



THE BRIDE
How many years has she been alive?

BILL
Don't ask how old she is, ask, if
she's five.



THE BRIDE
Is she five?



BILL
Aren't mothers like God, aren't you
supposed to automatically know?



THE BRIDE
I did and I do.
(pause)
I want to meet her.



BILL
Have dinner with us at my hacienda
tonight. She's expecting you.



THE BRIDE
What do you mean?



BILL
I knew you were on your way, so I
told B.B. Her mommy was coming to
see her.



THE BRIDE
(confused)
What have you told her about me?



BILL
That you were sick, that you were
asleep, but one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.
And she asked me, "If Mommy's been
asleep since I was born, how will
she know what I look like?" To
which I replied, "Because Mommy's
been dreaming of you." And she
said, "Then I'm gonna start
dreaming of her." So I gave her a

picture of you --



THE BRIDE
-- which one?



BILL
The one I took of you in Paris,
sitting on the steps with the
baguette in your hand. Since she
was one and a half years old, she's
slept with that picture of you next
to her bed.

The EXACT PHOTO DISSOLVES OVER The Bride's face, then
DISSOLVES AWAY.



THE BRIDE
You know, prettier photos of me do
exist.



BILL
And she's seen them. But the one
she wants looking after her while
she sleeps is the one of you
holding bread.
(pause)
We normally have dinner around
seven, is that convenient?



THE BRIDE
Yes.

Pause....The cars get closer...



THE BRIDE
When do we cross swords?



BILL
Well, it just so happens, my
hacienda comes with its very own
private beach. And my private
beach, just so happens to look
particularly beautiful bathed in
moonlight. And there just so
happens to be a full moon out
tonight. So, swordfighter, if you

want to sword fight, that's where I
suggest. But if you wanna be old
school about it - then we can wait
till dawn, and slice each other up
at sunrise, like a couple real life
honest to goodness samurais. As per
usual Kiddo, I'll leave the big
decisions up to you.

The cars will soon pass...



THE BRIDE
Do me a courtesy?



BILL
Anything.



THE BRIDE
Slow down as we pass...I want
another look at her.



BILL
Wear something nice tonight?



THE BRIDE
I have a dress all picked out.



BILL
Will I like it?



THE BRIDE
You said I looked beautiful last
time you saw me in it.



BILL
I'll dress up too.

His foot moves off the gas, slowing the car; her foot does
the same.

The cars in SLOW MOTION start to pass.

The Bride looks into the other car.

We ZOOM past Bill to the little girl in the passenger seat.
We go ONE FRAME AT A TIME till the car moves past us, to Bill
holding a pistol with a large silencer pointing right at our
face. He FIRES. It emits only a tiny PHOOF.

The Bride throws herself across the passenger seat as the
driver's side window EXPLODES over her head.

The two cars pass each other.

The Bride straightens herself in the driver's seat. She looks
in the rearview as Bill and her daughter drive away. Grabbing
the cell phone she screams in it;



THE BRIDE
You fucking maricone!

Bill on his cell, eyes on rearview.



BILL
Now you just wait one second there
little missy. Unless I'm confused,
we are trying to kill each other
aren't we? Now I wasn't planning on
taking a shot at you in front of
the squirt, but, she is asleep. And
if you're gonna forget everything I
ever taught you, and gawk like you
ain't got good sense, I'm gonna
take a shot, am I not?



THE BRIDE
Did she wake up?



BILL
Of course not. She's like you that
way.
I look forward to this evening. It
was great speaking with you, Bea.

He hangs up.



INT. WHERE HATTORI HANZO SLEEPS - JAPAN - NIGHT

Hattori Hanzo lies sleeping on his mat...

WHEN...

His phone wakes him up in the middle of the night...He
hurriedly answers it.

HANZO (JAPANESE)
(in phone; groggy)
Hello....



INT. MEXICO HOTEL - DAY

The Bride's on the phone, calling Japan, in tears.



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
Hattori!



HANZO (ENGLISH)
Beatrix, what's wrong?



THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
She's alive! My baby girl's alive!

CUT TO:



INT. THE BRIDE DRIVING TO BILL'S VILLA

The same shot we saw during the opening credits. She's
dressed in a white bridal gown, the exact replica of the one
she was bushwhacked in.

Over her CU we DISSOLVE TO A CU OF HANZO talking to her
earlier on the phone.



HANZO (JAPANESE)
Half of Bill's strength, lies in
his talent for the unexpected.
If you intend to vanquish this man,
and claim your daughter, you must
not only expect the unexpected. You
must do the unexpected.

WE DISSOLVE BACK to The Bride.

We see the same shots as before of The Bride driving up to
Bill's villa, through his iron gates, and parking by his
front door. We see TWO BLACK-SUITED MALE SATELLITES approach
her.

Now comes the new stuff.

She climbs out of her vehicle, goes to the back, opens the
boot, and removes her MOSSBERG PUMP ACTION SHOTGUN.

The two satellites freeze...

She SLIDES THE PUMP once, and FIRES.

ONE is BLOWN APART by the blast.

She SLIDES THE PUMP a second time...BLAST.

TWO buys the farm.

She slides the PUMP again...

...and BLASTS the front door, kicking it open and stepping
inside.



INT. BILL'S VILLA - NIGHT

ANOTHER BLACK-SUITED SATELLITE hurries down the stairs,
reaching for his weapon...

She FIRES the shotgun into his kneecap...

He TUMBLES down the stairs landing at her feet.

She points the shotgun straight down at his face.



THE BRIDE
Hello Manny.

She FIRES...Then moves further into the house.

Apparently, this is the do-the-unexpected part of her plan.
Fuck the charade, storm the camp, kill everyone she comes
across, send Bill to hell, scoop up her daughter, and head
for parts unknown.

So far, so good.

She enters the butcher block kitchen, and finds Bill's cook
and housekeeper, Josephina.

Josephina stares at the shotgun barrel pointed at her.



THE BRIDE
Hello Josephina.



JOSEPHINA
Hello Miss Beatrix.

She grabs the housekeeper, and shoves her into the kitchen
pantry.



THE BRIDE
Stay in here and don't come out. If
you leave this room I'll shoot you,
comprende?



JOSEPHINA
Yes.

She closes the pantry door, and moves into the hallway
leading to the living room.

With her back against the wall, holding her weapon tight, she
moves down the hall. As she creeps, an unseen Bill yells to
her from around the corner.



BILL'S VOICE (O.S.)
Kiddo! If you're through shooting
the servants, I'm in the living
room. You remember how to get to
the living room, don'tcha? Go down
to the end of the hall, and make a
left.

Back against the wall she creeps down the hall to the end.
She pumps the slide, and TURNS THE CORNER - SHOTGUN RAISED -
READY TO FIRE...

WHEN...

EX CU The BRIDE'S EYES - blink once.

EX CU HER FINGER comes off the trigger.

What the Bride sees in front of her is, Bill in a    tuxedo,
holding a small, orange squirt gun pointed at her.    Standing
next to him is five-year-old little B.B., dressed    up in a
very pretty party dress, arm outstretched holding    a orange
squirt gun, aimed at The Bride.

The three look at each other for a moment, then Bill says;



BILL
(loudly)
Bang Bang!

Then he suddenly clutches his abdomen like he's just been
shot.

BILL
Oh B.B., Mommy got us.

B.B. lowers her gun and plays out a big dying scene alongside
her dad...Bill falls to the floor.



BILL
Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

B.B. parrots this.



B.B.
Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying...

Bill on the floor, says up to his little girl;



BILL
Fall down sweetheart, Mommy shot
you.

The little girl falls down pretend dead.

The Bride, still absentmindedly pointing her weapon at them,
is truly thrown.

Bill delivers his lines from the floor, spoken like a dying
breath;



BILL
You did it Quick Draw Kiddo. You
are-the fastest.

And with these last words, pretends to die.

But then while pretending to be dead, he speaks in a dramatic
narrator's voice.



BILL
But...little did Quick Draw Kiddo
know,...that five-year-old B.B.
Gunn was only playing possum, due
to the fact she was impervious to
bullets.

B.B. raises her head off the floor and says;



B.B.

(to Mommy)
I'm impervious to bullets, Mommy.



BILL
(to B.B.)
Hey, get back down there, you're
playing possum.

The little girl's head drops back down.

Bill continues his dramatic narration;



BILL
So, as the smirking killer
approached, what she thought, was a
bullet-ridden corpse,...that's when
the little B.B. Gunn fired.

B.B. springs up holding her tiny orange squirt gun and says;



B.B.
Bang bang!

The Bride continues watching in gobsmackery.

Bill raises his head off the floor, and says to her in his
normal voice;



BILL
Mommy, you're dead - so die.

The Bride shakes off her confusion, and acts out a big death
scene fo her little girl.



THE BRIDE
Oh, B.B., you got me. I should have
known, you are the best.

She falls to the floor and pretends to die.

The little girl in her party dress, runs over to the big girl
in her wedding dress, and kneels over her mommy.

Mommy opens her eyes.



B.B.
Don't die Mommy, I was just
playing.

From the floor, looking up at her daughter, she speaks to her
for the first time.



MOMMY
I know baby.

They embrace each other.



B.B.
I waited a long time for you to
wake up, Mommy. Did you dream of me
- I dreamed of you?

The female killer says to her daughter as mommieness begins
to creep into her voice;



THE BRIDE
Every single night, baby.

She holds her daughter out at arm's length to get a better
look at her.



THE BRIDE
Now let me look at you. My my my...
What a pretty girl you are.



B.B.
You're pretty too, Mommy.

B.B. starts stroking her mother's long blonde hair.



THE BRIDE
Thank you.

All of a sudden, Bill has joined them on the floor.



BILL
When I showed you Mommy's picture,
tell Mommy what you said.

The little girl gets shy.



BILL

C'mon shy girl, you know what you
said, tell Mommy, it'll make her
fell good.

As she strokes her long blonde hair, little B.B. says;



B.B.
I said - I said - You're the most
beautiful woman I ever saw in the
whole white world.



BILL
That's the truth. That's what she
said.

B.B. points to Manny's blood, which splashed a little on the
Bride's wedding gown.



B.B.
What's that?



MOMMY
Oh, Mommy spilled something on her
dress.



B.B.
Blood?



MOMMY
No. Kool-Aid. Do you like Kool-Aid?



B.B.
No.



BILL
Do you not like it, or do you not
know what it is?

Parroting Bill;



B.B.
I do not know what it is.

MOMMY
Well, it's a very tasty beverage
that I used to drink, when I was a
little girl. It comes in a lot of
different flavors and colors, and
it's really good. Maybe we should
fix some sometime. Want to do that?

The little girl gives a big nod, yes.



BILL
Speaking of fixing and drinking and
eating, I think it's dinner time
don't you?

B.B. does an exaggerated nod, yes.



BILL
(to Mommy)
When you were doin all that fancy
shootin, you didn't happen to shoot
a nice Mexican woman about forty
five years old, did ya?



MOMMY
No.



BILL
(wiping imaginary sweat
off his brow)
Whew, then dinner should be done.
(shouting to the other
room)
Josephina! You can come out now,
we're ready for dinner.



JOSEPHINA (O.S.)
Yes, Mr. Bill.

He offers his hand to Mommy, and helps her to her feet. Then
says to B.B.;



BILL
Want to go on top of the world?

She says excitedly;



B.B.
Yeah!

He scoops the little girl up, puts her on his shoulders, and
as the mommy and the daddy and their little girl walk through
the house towards the dinner table, Bill and B.B. Sing The
Carpenter's song, "Top Of The World." It's obviously one of
their songs.



INT. DINNER ROOM - NIGHT

The dining room of Bill's house. The family, mother father
and daughter, sit at the dinner table eating.



BILL
B.B., don't you think Mommy has the
prettiest hair in the whole wide
world?



B.B.
Yes I do.



BILL
In fact it's better than pretty.
What's better than pretty?



B.B.
Gorgeous.



BILL
Very good, gorgeous. Mommy is
gorgeous.

The Bride shows no sign of thawing around Bill.



BILL
You know baby, Mommy's kinda mad at
Daddy.



B.B.

Why? Where you a bad daddy?



BILL
I'm afraid I was. I was a real bad
daddy.
(to Mommy)
Our little girl learned about life
and death the other day.
(to B.B.)
You want to tell Mommy about what
happened to Emilio?



B.B.
I killed him. I didn't mean to, but
I stepped on him and he stopped
moving.



BILL
Emilio was her goldfish. She came
running into my room holding the
fish in her hand, crying, "Daddy
daddy, Emilio's dead." And I said,
"Really, that's so sad. How did he
die?" And what did you say?



B.B.
I stepped on him.



BILL
Actually young lady, the words you
so strategically used were, "I
accidentally stepped on him."
Right?



B.B.
Yeah.



BILL
To which I queried, "And just how
did your foot accidentally find its
way into Emilio's fishbowl?" And
she told me no no no, Emilio was on
the carpet when she stepped on him.
(beat)
Hummmmmm, the plot thickens. And
just how did Emilio get on the

carpet? And Mommy, you would have
been real proud of her, because she
didn't lie. She said she took
Emilio out of his bowl, and put him
on the carpet. And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet, baby?



B.B.
He was -- flapping.



BILL
And then you stomped on him?



B.B.
Uh-huh.



BILL
And when you lifted your foot up,
what was Emilio doing then?



B.B.
Nothing.



BILL
He stopped flapping, didn't he?



B.B.
Uh-huh.



BILL
And you knew what that meant,
didn't you?



B.B.
Uh-huh.



BILL
What did that mean?

B.B.
He was dead.



BILL
(to Mommy)
She told me later, that the second
she lifted up her foot and saw him
not flapping, she knew he was dead.
Is that not the perfect visual
image of life and death? A fish
flapping on the carpet, and a fish
not flapping on the carpet. So
powerful even a five-year old child
with no concept of life and death
knew what it meant. Not only did
she know Emilio was dead, she knew
she had killed him. So she comes
running into my room, holding
Emilio in both of her little hands -
it was so cute - and she wanted me
to make Emilio better. And I asked
her, why did she step on Emilio?
And she said, she didn't know. But
I knew why. You didn't mean to hurt
Emilio, you just wanted to see what
would happen if you stepped on him,
right?



B.B.
Uh-huh.



BILL
And what happens when you stomp on
Emilio, is you kill him. And you
discovered that, didn't you?



B.B.
Uh-huh.



BILL
So we drove down to the beach, had
a little funeral, and gave Emilio a
burial at sea. And right now I'm
sure he's happy as can be, swimmin
around in fish heaven.
But the point being, our child
learned two very important lessons.
One, about life and death. The
other, somethings once you do, they

can't be undone. I knew just how
she felt
(to B.B.)
You loved Emilio, didn't you?



B.B.
Uh-huh.



BILL
Well sweety, I love Mommy, but I
did to Mommy what you did to
Emilio.



B.B.
You stomped on Mommy?



BILL
Worse.
(making his finger a gun)
I shot Mommy. Not pretend shoot,
like we were just doing. I shot her
for real.



B.B.
Why?



BILL
I don't know.



B.B.
Did you want to see what would
happen?



BILL
No, I   knew what   would happen to
Mommy   if I shot   her. What I didn't
know,   is when I   shot Mommy, what
would   happen to   me.



B.B.
What happened?

BILL
I was very sad. And that was when I
learned, somethings once you do,
they can never be undone.



B.B.
What happened to Mommy?



BILL
Why don't you ask Mommy.



B.B.
Are you okay Mommy. Does it hurt?



BILL
No sweety, it doesn't hurt anymore.



B.B.
Did it make you sick?



MOMMY
It put me to sleep. That's why I
haven't been with you B.B., I've
been asleep.



B.B.
But you're awake now, right?



MOMMY
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.



EXT. PORCH - DAWN

Bill sits on the steps of his porch in the back of the house
drinking a glass of red wine. The steps lead to the beach and
the sea.

Beatrix steps out onto the porch, and sits down on the steps
across from him.

Between them the dawn sky breaks.



BILL
Did she go to sleep easy?



THE BRIDE
It took her a little bit. She was
excited. She's quite the little
chatterbox.



BILL
Well, if she doesn't like you, you
got to kill her to say hello. But
if she likes you, you can't shut
her up. She's a chip off the ole
blonde in that regards.

He holds up the bottle of vino.



BILL
Red wine?

She shakes her blonde head, no.



BILL
C'mon, Bea, you're a whole lot more
fun with a couple glasses of wine
in ya.

She gives him a look.



BILL
(pointing towards the
beach)
We're going to go out there and
have at it, aren't we?

She shakes her blonde head, yes.



BILL
Well, I've already had    a glass. So
unless you want to win    by an unfair
advantage, you should    have a glass
of wine. So we're both    on the same
footing wine wise.

She holds out the empty glass, and he fills it with red.



BILL
You know, there's an old man down
here, his name is Esteban Viharo.
He was a pimp. I knew him when I
was a child. He was a friend of my
mother's. I told him about you.
When I showed him your picture he
smiles and said;
(imitating his accent)
"Yesss, I see the attraction." He
told me a story about taking me to
the movies when I was five. It was
a movie which had Lana Turner in
it. And whenever she would appear
on screen, he said I would stick my
thumb in my mouth and suck it, to
an obscure amount. And he knew
right then, this boy will be a fool
for blondes.



THE BRIDE
Who would of ever thought you'd be
such a good father?



BILL
Well not you, that's for damn sure.

She gives him another look.



THE BRIDE
Must we have to endure your little
zingers?



BILL
No we mustn't. But if you're going
to say sentences like that, in the
future, I will resist the
temptation.



THE BRIDE
Baby, you don't have a future.

Bill drinks some wine.

BILL
I sent you to L.A. and you never
came back. I thought you'd been
killed. Do you know how cruel it is
to make someone think someone they
love is dead? I mourned you. Then
in the third month of my mourning,
I track you down. I wasn't trying
to track you down, I was trying to
track down - the fucking assholes -
who I thought killed you. And when
I find you, what to I find? Not
only are you not dead, you're
getting married - to some fuckin
jerk - and you're pregnant? How do
you expect me to react?



THE BRIDE
Why do you think I hid?



BILL
Why did you leave in the first
place? You have cold eyes towards
me now. I understand their
temperature, but they were warm the
second to the last time I saw them,
or was that just my imagination?



THE BRIDE
No.

The Bride decides to tell all. As she tells this story, parts
will be shown on the screen.

To give herself a running start with the story she starts it
off in Japanese;



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
You sent me to L.A. to kill that
lady scoundrel, Lisa Wong.

Bill interrupts her.



BILL (ENGLISH)
You are you talking in Japanese?

The Bride explodes;

THE BRIDE (ENGLISH)
What the hell do you care what I
talk in? Don't you know when to
keep your mouth shut? I'm trying to
tell you what you want to know, if
you'll just shut up and listen and
stop talking! Now may I continue?



BILL
You're right, I'm wrong, continue.



THE BRIDE
The morning I left, I threw up. I
don't feel like speaking in
Japanese anymore - on the plane, I
threw up. When I got to my hotel, I
threw up. So naturally I started
thinking, maybe I might be
pregnant. So I bought one of those
home pregnancy kits. Went back to
my room and took the test. The
little strip said blue. I was going
to have a baby. I tried to call
you, but you weren't there, so I
just thought I'd call back later.



BILL
But you never did.



THE BRIDE
- Would you shut up, I'm trying to
tell you how I feel.



BILL
My apologies, please continue.



THE BRIDE
So I just figured I'd call you back
later. I was just so happy, I put
on music and danced by myself in
the hotel suite, holding my little
blue strip.
What I didn't know, was at some leg
of my journey, I was spotted. With
me in Los Angeles it didn't take
Lisa Wong long to figure out
someone put a hit out on her. So
she sent an assassin of her own to

kill me in my hotel room. As I was
dancing in euphoria, the killer
came down the hall.

There's a knock on the hotel room door.

The Bride stops dancing and goes to the door's peephole.

PEEPHOLE POV: A pretty KOREAN WOMAN in the blazer and skirt
outfit of a hotel manager. She's holding a basket of flowers.

The Bride says through the door;



THE BRIDE
Hello, can I help you?



HOTEL WOMAN
Hello, I'm Karen Kim, I'm the
hospitality manager of the hotel. I
have a welcome gift from the
management.

Seeing it through the peephole.



THE BRIDE
Oh, it's beautiful. But I'm kinda
busy at this second, could you
possibly come back later?

As she talks, she accidentally drops the blue strip, she
bends down to pick it up...

WHEN...

A SHOTGUN BLAST BLOWS A HOLE in the door, right where the
bent over woman was previously standing.

Karen kicks open the door, Pump Action Shotgun in hand.

The Bride's on her back, on the floor below her.

Karen aims the shotgun down at her.

With her foot, The Bride kicks the front door.

It SLAMS BACK HITTING Karen in the face.

The Bride scrambles to her feet, running for cover.

Karen pushes the door aside, steps into the room, and FIRES
the shotgun The Bride's way.

The Bride DIVES out of the way.

The BLAST DESTROYS the side of the room it HITS.

The Bride comes up from the floor with her SOG in her hand,
and THROWS IT across the room at Karen...

Karen BLOCKS the thrown knife with her shotgun. The blade
sticking in the weapon's wooden stock. She removes the knife,
and drops it to the floor.

The Bride is a sitting duck. There's nothing she can do
except wait to get shot.



KAREN
So you came here to kill Lisa Wong,
huh? Well that's my sister, bitch.
I'm Karen Wong, and I've come here
to kill you.

She raises the shotgun, and takes aim at The Bride...



THE BRIDE
Wait a second!

Karen stops.



THE BRIDE
Yes, I'm an assassin. Yes I did
come here to kill your sister. But
I'm not gonna do that now.



KAREN
Oh, I know you're not --



THE BRIDE
- listen to me! I just found out,
right now - not two minutes before
you blew a hole in the door, I'm
pregnant.

Karen looks at her, "what?".



THE BRIDE
On that table is the    home pregnancy
kit. On the floor by    the door is
the strip that says    I'm pregnant.
I'm telling you the    truth, I don't
want to and I won't    kill your
sister. I just want    to go home.

KAREN
What is this, bullshit story number
twelve in the female assassin's
handbook?



THE BRIDE
Any other time you'd be a hundred
percent right. But this time you're
a hundred percent wrong. I'm the
deadliest woman in the world, but
right now I'm scared shitless for
my baby. Please, you hafta believe
me. Look at the strip, it's on the
floor.

Karen looks over to the door, and sees the tiny strip on the
floor.



KAREN
Sit down on that bed and put your
hands behind your head.

The Bride complies. Karen bends down and picks the strip off
the floor. Then takes the package it came in and reads the
directions on the box.



THE BRIDE
Blue means pregnant.



KAREN
I'll read it myself, thank you.

It is blue, Karen's starting to believe her.



KAREN
Okay, say I were to believe you,
what then?



THE BRIDE
Just go home. I'll do the same.

Karen does...She starts backing out of the room...before she
leaves, she says;

KAREN
You fucked with the Wong sisters.



BACK ON THE PORCH



THE BRIDE
Facing Karen Wong, was the most
frightening moment I have ever
experienced. And that includes
three years with that evil bastard
Pai Mei. Before that strip turned
blue, I was a woman, I was your
woman. I was a killer, who killed
for you. Before that strip turned
blue, I would have jumped a
motorcycle on to a speeding train
...for you. But once that strip
turned blue, I could no longer do
any of those things. Not anymore.
Because now I was a mother. A
mother who only had one thought on
her mind. Please don't harm my
baby. Can you understand that?



BILL
Yes. But why tell me now, and not
then?



THE BRIDE
You wouldn't have let me go.
Specially once you found out I was
pregnant. You would've tried to
talk me out of it. It would have
been a big scene. I just said fuck
it.

Starting to get mad.



BILL
Fuck who?



THE BRIDE
Bill, you couldn't know I was
pregnant, once you knew, you'd
claim it, and I didn't want that.

BILL
That's not your decision to make.



THE BRIDE
Yes, but it's the right decision.
And I made it for my daughter.
Everybody on this earth deserves to
start with a clean slate. But with
us - my daughter would be born into
a world she shouldn't be. Robbing
her of the one thing everybody
deserves. She would be born with
blood stains. I had to choose. I
chose her.

She takes a sip of wine. It's morning now. And now it's her
turn.



THE BRIDE
You know five years ago, if I had
to make a list of impossible things
that could never happen.
You performing a coup de grace on
me by bustin a cap in my crown,
would be right at the top of the
list.
(beat)
I'd've been wrong, wouldn't I?

Bill listens stoney, then;



BILL
I'm sorry was that a question? Of
impossible things that could never
happen - yes in this instance you
would have been wrong.

The Bride listens stoney, then;



THE BRIDE
Well?



BILL
Well what?



THE BRIDE
Explain yourself.

BILL
I already have. When I told you the
story of when I thought you were
dead. Didn't you get how badly I
felt?



THE BRIDE
You call that an explanation?



BILL
Well if that's too cryptic let's
get literal.
(beat)
There are consequences to breaking
the heart of a murdering bastard.
You experienced some of them.

That's his explanation.

She hears it.

They both understand one another.



THE BRIDE
You and I have unfinished business.



BILL
Baby, you ain't kidding.

They both laugh.



BILL
You know how proud I am of you,
don't you?



THE BRIDE
Yes.



BILL
You know I was rooting for you,
don't you?

THE BRIDE
I figured.



BILL
You know on that beach out there I
want you to be the victor?

She nods her head, yes.



BILL
You also know you're going to have
to defeat me. I can't just give it
to you, even though I want to.



THE BRIDE
It won't be necessary for you to
give me anything. I've surpassed
you. I'll take it.



BILL
Well, as they say in Missouri, show
me.



EXT. THE BEACH - MORNING

As the blue waves of the Gulf of Mexico crash on the beach,
The Bride in her bridal gown, and Bill, his tuxedo jacket
off, face each other in a combat stance.

The BRIDE
Breeze blowing her blonde hair, holding her Hanzo sword in
its sheath.

BILL
stares across the sand to the figure of the Bride, his
student, facing him at sunrise with a weapon he taught her to
use. This is where all who teach combat artistry may end up.
Facing a Frankenstein monster of their own creation. He
removes his Hanzo sword from its sheath with GREAT FLOURISH.

WIDE SHOT
The two combatants...quite far from each other...they intend
to charge attack...stand in showdown stance.

The BRIDE
The VENGEANCE THEME EXPLODES ON THE SOUNDTRACK.
She takes her combat stance. But what she doesn't do is
remove her sword from its wood sheath. The fist of her left
hand is wrapped around the wood sheath's center. Her right

empty hand, raises and makes a beckoning gesture to Bill.
Then with a face completely devoid of emotion, says in
Japanese;



THE BRIDE (JAPANESE)
Attack me.

She's facing him, sword in sheath, hand far from handle, in a
standing still position, not moving a muscle of blinking an
eye, staring her laser beams in Bill's direction waiting for
his attack.

He stands in a combat position, sword raises in a combat
grip, to charge her.



BILL
(to himself)
That's my girl.

He screams a samurai scream...and charges her...

She stands motionless...

Unblinking...

Watching him coming...

No fear....

No expression...

We go back and forth, close, wide, low.

TILL...

They meet...

Using only her left arm, with the sheathed Hanzo sword in its
grip, she blocks all of his blows, right arm unmoving down at
her side...sort of like Pai Mei did to her earlier...his
sword and her sheath lock together...they're close to each
other, she brings up her right arm, sticks out two fingers,
and hits Bill on ten different pressure points on his body.
Then hits him straight on in the heart with her palm. His
body jolts, like he's just had a heart attack...he coughs up
a little blood...he looks at her.

Their faces are very close...

The face of the cold ice woman Ninja, melts away before our
eyes, and the face of Beatrix Kiddo is filled once again with
compassion.



BILL

He taught you the ten point palm
exploding heart technique?



THE BRIDE
Of course he did.



BILL
Why didn't you tell me?

She doesn't have an answer.

She looks at him apologetically;



THE BRIDE
I don't know...Because...I'm
a...bad person.

He smiles at her duplicitly, and says with blood on his lips;



BILL
No. You're not a bad person. You're
a terrific person. You're my
favorite person. But every once in
awhile...you can be a real cunt.

They smile at each other.

Then...

Bill turns his back to her...

And walks five steps in the opposite direction...with each
step his heart swells, on the fifth...

It BURSTS...WE HEAR A SOUND, like of a tire blowout...

He falls to the beach...dead.

The Bride walks over to his body.

She unsheaths her Hanzo sword.

Blood lies in a pool, by Bill's mouth.

She dips the tip of the blade in the blood, leaving the
tiniest of crimson smudges.

She then removes the Bill handkerchief, and wipes Bill's
blood from off the blade onto the white cloth.

She lets the Bill handkerchief drop onto his body.

The Jingi sword Hattori Hanzo created, just for her, for this
purpose, has come to the end of its journey.

Beatrix, in a moment    of enormous generosity, allows herself,
one final tear, shed    for her corrupter, her enemy, the father
of her child,...her    MAN. The tear is for her as well. For
she's very aware she    will never ever be completely any other
man's WOMAN.

EX CU The Hanzo BLADE slowly sliding into the wood sheath.

EX CU the single teardrop, sliding down her cheek.

The blade disappears inside the sheath.

The teardrop falls of her chin.

Her journey, her revenge, her victory, her unfinished
business, is completed.

The Bride exits the beach.

Bill doesn't.
SERIES OF SHOTS END FILM
As a female voice sings a song on the soundtrack.

We see the Bride, get B.B.

The Bride and B.B. are driving away.

The Bride and B.B. eating in a coffee shop.

The Bride and B.B. in a motel room. They both wear bath
towels and both of their blonde heads are wet. The Bride sits
behind her on the bed, combing the little one's head.

The Bride spooning B.B. from behind, both of them are asleep.

It's the morning...

B.B. Sits on the motel room bed, watching Saturday morning
cartoons on T.V.



INT. MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - MORNING

The Bride is on the floor of the motel room bathroom, crying
her eyes out.

She shoves a towel in her mouth so B.B. won't hear her.

We wonder for a moment what's wrong...

Till we see her face in CU...

Her tears are tears of joy.

She can't believe this is even happening.

Her daughter is alive. They're together. They get to begin
again.

She covers her mouth so B.B. won't hear her crying and get
worried or confused.

But as the deadliest woman on the planet, lies on the motel
room bathroom floor, smile on her face, twinkle in her eyes,
happier than she's ever been, she thinks one thought. Over
and over again....

Thank you god...thank you god...thank you god...thank you
god.

She washes her face in the sink, when she's presentable, she
walks out of the bathroom, jumps on the bed with her baby,
hugs her from behind as the two watch Saturday morning
cartoons.

TWO SHOT CU
Both blonde heads, the big one and the little one, next to

The lioness has been reunited with her cub, and all is right

Episode 2: Attack of the Clones

EXT. SPACE
A vast sea of stars severas as a backdrop for the Main Title, following by a rollup, whcih crawls into infinity.

There is unrest in the Galactic Senate
Several hundred solar systems under
the leadership of the rebel leader, Count
Dooku, have decalred their intentions to
secede from the Republic.

This separatist movement has made it
difficult for the limited number of
Jedi Kights to maintain peace and
order in the galaxy.

Senator Amidala, the former Queen of
Naboo, is returning to Coruscant
to vote on the critical issue
of creating an army to assist the
overwhelmed Jedi.

PAN UP to reveal the amber city planet of Coruscant. A yellow Naboo Fighter flies OVER CAMERA toward the planet, followed by a large Royal Cruiser and two more Fighters.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - DAWN
The ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet.

EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
Two Naboo Fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Royal Starship lands on the central lead, and the third Fighter lands on the remaining plaform.

A small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. One of the members of the group os a well dressed JAR JAR BINKS, a member of the Galactic Representative Commission, and DORME, Senator Amidala's handmaiden.

One of the FIGHTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR AMIDALA'S Security Officer. He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT.

CAPTAIN TYPHO
We made it. I guess I was wrong,
there was no danger at all.

The ramp ;pwers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE HANDMAIDEN (VERSE) and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. AMIDALA is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation.

The DIGNITARIES start to move forward. SENATOR AMIDALA reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed.

Klaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS get up and run to where SENATOR AMIDALA lies dying. Beyond, ARTOO DETOO drops down from the Naboo Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage. The FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by SENATOR AMIDALA and takes off her helmet, revealing SENATOR PADME AMIDALA.

PADM 
Cord ...

She gathers up her decoy double in her arms. Cord 's eyes are open. She looks up at her.

CORD 
... I'm sorry, m'lady... I'm... not sure I...

CORD  dies. PADM  hugs her.

AMIDALA
No!... No!... No!...

PADM  lowers CORD  to the ground. She gets up and looks around at the devastation. There are tears in her eyes.

AMIDALA
I should not have come back.

CAPTAIN TYPHO
M'Lady, you are still in danger.

Amidala says nothing.

CAPTAIN TYPHO
This vote is very important. You did
your duty and Cord  did hers. Now
come. (she doesn't respond) M'Lady,
please!

She turns. They walk away. ARTOO lets out a small whimper and rolls off after them.

EXT. SENATE BUILDING - DAY
The massive Senate Building glistens in the afternoon sun. Small patches of fog have still to burn off.

INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
The vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter. MAS AMEDDA, the Supreme Chancellor's majordomo, tries to quiet things down as PALPATINE confers with an AIDE, UV GIZEN, riding a small one man floating scooter.

MAS AMEDDA
Order! We shall have order! The motion
for the Republic to commission an army
takes precedent, and that is what we
will vote on at this time.

Everything quiets down. The AIDE disperses, and SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE steps to the podium.

PALPATINE
...My esteemed colleagues, excuse
me... I have just received some
tragic and disturbing news. Senator
Amidala of the Naboo system... Has
been assassinated!

There is a shock silence in the vast arena.

PALPATINE
(continued)
This grievous blow is especially
personal to me. Before I became
Chancellor, I served Amidala when
she was Queen. She was a great
leader who fought for justice, not
only in this honourable assembly,
but also on her home planet. She
was so loved she could have been
elected queen for life. She
believed in public service, and
she fervently believed in
democracy. Her death is a great
loss to us all. We will all mourn
her as a relentless champion of
freedom... and as a dear friend.

There is a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves his pod into the centre of the arena.

SENATOR ASK AAK
How many more Senators will die
before this civil strife ends! We
must confront these rebels now,
and they need an army to do it.

A second pod moves into the centre of the area with DARSANA, the
AMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM.

AMBASSADOR DARSANA
Why weren't the Jedi able to stop
this assassination? We are no
longer safe, under their protection.

Senator ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod.

ORN FREE TAA
The Republic needs more security
now! Before it comes to war.

PALPATINE
Must I remind the Senator from
Malastare that negotiations are
continuing with the separatists.
Peace is our objective here... not
war.

The SENATORS yell pro and con. MAS AMEDDA tries to calm things down. SENATOR PADME AMIDALA, with CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, and DORME, manoeuvre her pod into the centre of the vast arena.

AMIDALA
My noble colleagues, I concur with
the Supreme Chancellor. At all
costs, we do not want war!

The Senate goes quiet, then there is an outburst of cheering and
applause.

PALPATINE
It is with great surprise and
joy the chair recognises the
Senator from Naboo, Padm  Amidala.

PADM 
Less than an hour ago, an
assassination attempt was made
against my life. One of my
bodyguards and six  others were
ruthlessly and senselessly
murdered. I was the target but,
more importantly, I believe this
security measure before you, was
the target. I have led the
opposition to build an army... but
there is someone in this body who
will stop at nothing to assure it's
passage...

Many of the SENATORS boo and yell at SENATOR AMIDALA.

PADM 
(continuing)
I warn you, if you vote to create
this army, war will follow. I
have experienced the misery of war
first-hand; I do not wish to do it
again.

There is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.

PADM 
Wake up, Senators... you must wake
up! If you offer the separatists
violence, they can only show us
violence in return! Many will
lose their lives. All will lose
their freedom. This decision
could very well destroy the very
foundation of our great Republic.
I pray you do not let fear push
you into a disastrous decision.
Vote down this security measure,
which is nothing less than a
declaration of war! Does anyone
here want that? I cannot believe
they do.

There is an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. SENATOR ORN FREE TAA moves his pod next to AMIDALA.

ORN FREE TAA
My motion to defer the vote must
be dealt with first. That is the
rule of law.

AMIDALA looks angry and frustrated. PALPATINE gives her a sympathetic look.

PALPATINE
Due to the lateness of the hour
and the seriousness of this
motion, we will take up these
matters tomorrow. Until then, the
Senate stands adjourned.

EXT. EXECUTIVE QUARTERS BUILDING - DAY
The giant towers of the Republic Executive Building seem to reach the heavens. Traffic clogs the smoggy sky.

INT. CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE - DAY
CHANCELLOR PALPATINE sits behind his desk with TWO RED-CLAD ROYAL GUARDS on either side of the door. YODA, PLOT KOON, KI-AD-MUNDI, and MACE WINDU sit acress from him.

PALPATINE
I don't know how much longer I can
hold off the vote, my friends.
More and more star systems are
joining the separatists.

MACE WINDU
If they do break away -

PALPATINE
No! I will not let that happen!

MACE WINDU
But if they do, you must realise
there aren't enough Jedi to
protect the Republic. We are
keepers of the peace, not soldiers.

PALPATINE
Master Yoda, do you think it will
really come to war?

YODA closes his eyes.

YODA
Worse than war, I fear... Much
worse.

PALPATINE
What?

MACE WINDU
What do you sense, Master?

YODA
Impossible to see ... The Dark Side
clouds everything. But this I am
sure of -
(opens his eyes)
Do their duty the Jedi will.

A muted BUZZER SOUNDS. A hologram of an AIDE, DAR WAC, appears on the Chancellor's desk.

DAR WAC
The loyalist committee has arrived,
my Lord.

PALPATINE
Send them in.

They all stand as SENATOR AMIDALA, CAPTAIN TYPHO, JAR JAR, MAS AMEDDA, DORME, and SENATORS BAIL ORGANA, HOROX RYYDER and ORN FREE TAA enter the office. YODA and MACE WINDU move to greet the SENATOR, YODA taps AMIDALA with his cane.

YODA
With you the force is strong...
young Senator. To see you alive
brings warm feeling to my heart.

PADM 
Thank you, Master Yoda. Do you
have any idea who was behind
the attack?

MACE WINDU
Our intelligence points to
disgruntled spice miners, on
the moons of Naboo.

PADM 
I don't wish to disagree but I
think that Count Dooku was behind
it.

There is a stir of surprise.

MACE WINDU
You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku
was once a Jedi. He wouldn't
assassinate anyone, it is not in
his character.

KI-ADI-MUNDI
He is a political idealist, not
a murderer.

YODA
In dark times nothing is what it
appears to be, but the fact remains
Senator, in grave danger you are.

PALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city.

PALPATINE
Count Dooku has always avoided
any kind of conflict. It appears
he has no desire to start a war.
Why would he kill you? To what end?

PADM 
I don't know, but everything in my
being tells me he was behind it...

After gazing out of the window for several moments Palpatine turns to
Mace.

PALPATINE
Master Jedi, may I suggest that
the Senator be placed under the
protection of your graces.

BAIL ORGANA
Do you think that is a wise use
of manpower during these stressful
times?

PADM 
Chancellor, if I may comment, I
do not believe the...

PALPATINE
..."situation is that serious."
No, but I do, Senator.

PADM 
Chancellor, please! I don't want
any more guards!

PALPATINE
I realise all too well that
additional security might be
disruptive for you, but perhaps
someone you are familiar with... an
old friend like... Master Kenobi...

PALPATINE nods to MACE WINDU, who nods back.

MACE WINDU
That's possible. He has just
returned from a Border dispute on
Ansion.

PALPATINE
You must remember him, M'Lady...
he watched over you during the
blockade conflict.

PADM 
This is not necessary, Chancellor.

PALPATINE
Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I
will rest easier. We had a big
scare today. The thought of
losing you is unbearable.

AMIDALA sighs as the JEDI get up to leave.

MACE WINDU
I will have Obi-Wan report to you
immediately, M'Lady.

YODA leans into her ear.

YODA
Too little about yourself you
worry, Senator, and too much about
politics. Be mindful of your
danger, Padm . Accept our help.

As the JEDI leave the office, PALPATINE continues to pace behind his desk.

PALPATINE
I will not like this Republiv, that
has stood for over a thousand
years, be split in two

EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - TWILIGHT
A graceful skyscraper twinkles in the evening light of Coruscant.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT CORRIDOR - EVENING
The door to the apartment slides open. JAR JAR walks into the corridor, where TWO JEDI are exiting the elevator. He recognises OBI-WAN and becomes extremely excited, jumping around, shaking his hand.

JAR JAR
Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilen
to see'en yousa. Wahoooooo!

OBI-WAN smiles.

OBI-WAN
It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar.

JAR JAR
Oops! Wheresa mesa manners?
Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. I
completely forgot myself for
a moment there. I have had to learn
Diplodiaclect... speak it like a
native now. Don't really see the
point, actually, but members of
the Senate seem to prefer it...

JAR JAR notices OBI-WAN'S APPRENTICE.

JAR JAR
(continuing)
...and this, I take it, is your
apprentice... Nooooooooo! Annie?
Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie?
(Looks at Anakin)
Nooooooo! Yousa so biggen!
Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa no
believen.

ANAKIN
Hi, Jar Jar.

JAR JAR grabs hold of ANAKIN and envelops him in a big hug.

JAR JAR
Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii!

INT. SENATE BUILDING, APARTMENT - EVENING
PADME is in a conference with CAPTAIN TYPHO and DORME. JAR JAR enters the room, followed by the TWO JEDI.

JAR JAR
Lookie... lookie... Oops!... Oh,
dear, I'm afraid I've forgotten
myself again.

PADME and TYPHO rise as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stop before the SENATOR. OBI-WAN steps forward. ANAKIN stares at PADME. She glances at him.

OBI-WAN
It's a great pleasure to see you again,
M'Lady.

PADM 
It has been far too long Master
Kenobi. I'm so glad our paths
have crossed again... but I must
warn you that I think your
presence here is unnecessary.

OBI-WAN
I'm sure the Jedi Council have
their reasons.

She moves in front of ANAKIN

PADM 
Annie??
(stares)
My goodness you've grown.

They look at each other for a long moment.

ANAKIN
(trying to be smooth)
So have you... grown more
beautiful, I mean... and much
shorter... for a Senator, I mean.

OBI-WAN looks disapprovingly at his apprentice. PADME laughs and shakes her head.

PADM 
Oh Annie, you'll always be that
little boy I knew on Tatooine.

This embarrasses ANAKIN, and he looks down. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO smile.

OBI-WAN
Our presence will be invisible,
M'Lady.

CAPTAIN TYPHO
I am very grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi. The situation is
more dangerous than the Senator
will admit.

PADM 
I don't need more security, I need
answers. I want to know who is
trying to kill me.

OBI-WAN
(frowning)
We're here to protect you
Senator, not to start an
investigation.

ANAKIN
We will find out who is trying to
kill you Padm , I promise you.

He's done it again. He bites his lip in frustration and shame. OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a dirty look.

OBI-WAN
We are not going to exceed our
mandate, my young Padawan learner.

ANAKIN
I meant in the interest of
protecting her, Master, of course.

OBI-WAN
We are not going through this
exercise again, Anakin. You will
pay attention to my lead.

ANAKIN
Why?

OBI-WAN
What??!!

ANAKIN
Why else do you think we were
assigned to her, if not to find
the killer? Protection is a job
for local security... not Jedi.
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our
mandate.

OBI-WAN
We will do as the Council has
instructed, and you will learn
your place, young one.

PADM 
Perhaps with merely your presence,
the mysteries surrounding this
threat will be revealed.  Now if
you will excuse me I will retire.

Everyone gives AMIDALA a slight bow as she and DORME leave the room.

CAPTAIN TYPHO
Well, I know I feel a lot better
having you here.
I'll have an officer on every
floor and I'll be at the command
centre downstairs.

JAR JAR
Mesa busten wit happiness seein
Yousa again, Annie. Deesa bad
times, bombad times.

Captain Typho leaves.

ANAKIN
She didn't even recognise me, Jar
Jar. I thought about her every
day since we parted... and she's
forgotten me completely.

JAR JAR
Shesa happy. Happier den mesa
see-en her in longo time.

OBI-WAN
Anakin, you're focusing on the
Negative again. Be mindful of your
thoughts. She was glad to see us.
Now lets check the security here.

ANAKIN
Yes, my master.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - EVENING
The vast Jedi Temple sits on an endless flat plain, silhouetted by a against the traffic-filled sky.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, CORRIDOR - EVENING
MACE WINDU and YODA walk down the long hallways, silhouetted by a lit room at the end.

MACE WINDU
Why couldn't we see this attack on
the Senator?

YODA
Masking the future, is this
disturbance in the Force.

MACE WINDU
The propecy is coming true, the
Dark Side is growing.

YODA
And only those who have turned to
the Dark Side can sense the
possibilities of the future. Only
going through the Dark Side can we
see.

MACE WINDU
It's been ten years, and the Sith
still have no shown themselves.
Do you think they are behind this?

YODA
...Out there, they are. A
certainty that is.

MACE WINDU
Do you think Obi-Wan's apprentice
will be able to bring balance to
the Force?

YODA
Only if he chooses to follow his
destiny.

There is a long silence as they walk away. Only footsteps are heard.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
PADME is asleep in her bed, lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds. ARTOO stands in the corner of the bedroom. His power is off.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN R0OM - NIGHT
ANAKIN is standing in the living room. He is in a meditative state. It is quiet. We hear DISTANT FOOTSTEPS in the corridor outside the apartment. Suddenly ANAKIN'S eyes pop open. His eyes dart around the room. He reaches for his lightsaber, then smiles and puts it back in his belt.

The door to the apartment slides open, and OBI-WAN enters.

OBI-WAN
Captain Typho has more than enough
men downstairs. No assassin will
try that way. Any activity up
here?

ANAKIN
Quiet as a tomb. I don't like
just waiting here for something to
happen to her.

OBI-WAN checks a palm-sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt. It shows a shot of ARTOO by the door, but no sign of PADME on the bed.

OBI-WAN
What's going on?

ANAKIN shrugs.

ANAKIN
She covered that camera. I don't
think she liked me watching her.

OBI-WAN
What is she thinking?

ANAKIN
She programmed Artoo to warn us if
there's an intruder.

OBI-WAN
It's not an intruder I'm worried
about. There are many other ways
to kill a Senator.

ANAKIN
I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin. Don't we, Master?

OBI-WAN
You're using her as bait??

ANAKIN
It was her idea... No harm will
come to her. I can sense
everything going on in that room.
Trust me.

OBI-WAN
It's too risky... and your senses
aren't that attuned, young
apprentice.

ANAKIN
And yours are?

OBI-WAN
Possibly.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
As PADME sleeps, a PROBE DROID approaches outside her window. It sends out several small arms that attach to the window, creating sparks that shut down the security system. Then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass. A FAINT SOUND is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window.

ARTOO wakes up, and his lights go on. The PROBE DROID freezes. ARTOO looks around, makes a PLAINTIVE LITTLE SOUND, then shuts down again. The PROBE DROID attaches a little tube to the window. TWO DEADLY LOOKING CENTIPEDE-LIKE KOUHUNS exit the tube, crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping PADME.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their conversation in the main room of the apartment.

OBI-WAN
You look tired.

ANAKIN
I don't sleep well, anymore.

OBI-WAN
Because of your mother?

ANAKIN
I don't know why I keep dreaming
About her now. I haven't seen her
since I was little.

OBI-WAN
Dreams pass in time.

ANAKIN
I'd rather dream of Padm . Just
Being around her again is...
intoxicating.

OBI-WAN
Mind your thoughts, Anakin, they
betray you. You've made a
commitment to the Jedi order... a
commitment not easily broken...
and don't forget she's a
politician. They're not to be
trusted.

ANAKIN
She's not like the others in the
Senate, Master.

OBI-WAN
It's been my experience that
Senators are only focused on
pleasing those who fund their
campaigns... and they are more
than willing to forget the
niceties of democracy to get those
funds.

ANAKIN
Not another lecture, Master. Not
on the economics of politics....
It's too early in the morning... and
besides, you're generalising. The
Chancellor doesn't appear to
be corrupt.

OBI-WAN
Palpatine's a politician, I've
observed that he is very clever at
following the passions and
prejudices of the Senators.

ANAKIN
I think he is a good man. My
instincts are very positive
about...

ANAKIN looks stunned. He looks sharply at OBI-WAN

OBI-WAN
I sense it, too.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
ARTOO sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed. THE KOUHUNS are inches from PADME'S face. Their mouths are open, and wicked stinger tongues flick out.


OBI-WAN and ANAKIN burst into the room. The KOUHUNS stand on their hind legs and hiss as PADME wakes up. ANAKIN throws himself in front of her, whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber.

OBI-WAN sees the DROID outside the window and raqces straight at it, crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window.

EXT. WINDOW LEDGE, APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
OBI-WAN flies through the glass window and flings himself at the PROBE DROID, grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee. The PROBE DROID sinks under the weight of OBI-WAN but manages to stay afloat and fly away, with the Jedi hanging on for dear life, a hundred stories above the city.

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
ANAKIN and PADME stare at the sight of OBI-WAN being carried off by the DROID. ANAKIN turns to her. She pulls her nightdress around her shoulders.

ANAKIN
Stay here!

CAPTAIN TYPHO, with TWO GUARDS and DORME, enter the room as Anakin dashes out.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
The PROBE DROID sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface, causing OBI-WAN to almost lose his grip. As they dart in and out of the speeder traffic, OBI-WAN disconnects a wire on the back of the DROID. Its power shuts off! OBI-WAN and the DROID drop like rocks. OBI-WAN realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back. The DROID'S systems light up again and it takes off.

EXT. SENATE APARTMENTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
ANAKIN charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders. He vaults into an open one and takes off, gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - NIGHT
The DROID bumps against a wall, hoping to knock the Jedi loose. It moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him. It takesthe JEDI wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-WAN is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called ZAM WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-WAN hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the JEDI. EXPLOSIONS burst all around OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN
I have a bad feeling about this.

FINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-WAN falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The JEDI struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, ANAKIN.

ANAKIN
That was wacky! I almost lost you
in the traffic.

OBI-WAN
What took you so long?

ANAKIN
Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't
find a speeder I really liked,
with an open cockpit... and with
the right speed capabilities...
and then you know I had to get a
really gonzo color...

They zoom upward in hot pursuit of ZAM asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.

OBI-WAN
If you'd spend as much time
working on your saber skills as
you do on your wit, young Padawan,
you would rival Master Yoda as a
swordsman.

ANAKIN
I thought I already did.

OBI-WAN
Only in your mind, my very young
apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!

As this conversation is going on, ANAKIN deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. ZAM WESELL continues firing at them.

ANAKIN
Sorry, I forgot you don't like
flying, Master.

OBI-WAN
I don't mind flying... but
what you're doing is suicide!

They barely miss a commuter train

ANAKIN
Master, you know I've been flying
since before I could walk. I'm very
good at this.

OBI-WAN
Just slow down!

ZAM WESSEL and the JEDI race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. ZAM races into a tram tunnel.

OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Wait! Don't go in there!

ANAKIN zooms into the tunnel after ZAM. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.

OBI-WAN
(continuing)
You know I don't like it when you
do that!

ANAKIN
Sorry, Master. Don't worry, this
guy's gonna kill himself any
minute now!

ZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN
What are you doing? He's gonna
blast me!

ANAKIN
Right - this isn't working.

ANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.

OBI-WAN
That was too close!

ANAKIN
Clear that!

OBI-WAN
What??

ANAKIN
Clear the flag! We're losing
power! Hurry!

OBI-WAN leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.

OBI-WAN
Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I
don't  like it when you do that!

ANAKIN
So sorry, Master.

They chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.

OBI-WAN
It's dangerous near those power
couplings! Slow down! Don't go
through there!

Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.

OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Yiiii, what are you doing?

ANAKIN
Sorry, Master!

OBI-WAN
(sarcastically)
Oh, that was good...

ANAKIN
That was crazy!!!

ZAM slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as ANAKIN approaches.

ANAKIN
(continuing)
Ahh, damn.

OBI-WAN
Stop!!

ANAKIN
No, we can make it.

ANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.

OBI-WAN
I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm
crazy.

ANAKIN
But it worked... we made it.

OBI-WAN
(angrily)
It didn't work... we've stalled!
And you almost got us killed!

ANAKIN
I think we're still alive.

ANAKIN works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.

OBI-WAN
(very angrily)
It was stupid!

ANAKIN
(sheepishly)
I could have made it...

OBI-WAN
(furious)
But you didn't!!! And now we've
lost him.

Suddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. EXPLOSIONS surround them. They look up to see ZAM WESSEL take off.

ANAKIN
No we didn t...

Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right

OBI-WAN
Where are you going?! He went
down there, the other way.

ANAKIN
This is a shortcut... I think.

OBI-WAN
What do you mean,  You think? 
What kind of shortcut?! He went
completely the other way! You ve
lost him!

ANAKIN
Master, if we keep this chase
going, that creep s gonna end up
deep fried. Personally, I d very
much like to find out who in the
hell he is and who he s working
for...

OBI-WAN
(sarcastic)
Oh, so that s why we re going in
the wrong direction.

ANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.

OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Well, you lost him.

ANAKIN
I m deeply sorry, Master.

ANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to
start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.

ANAKIN
(continuing)
Excuse me for a moment.

ANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zam s speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunter s speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.

ZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeder s cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM can t reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.

OBI-WAN has jumped into the driver s seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passenger s seat.

ANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAM S hand. She grabs the Jedi s hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of it s nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunter s speeder.

Just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.

EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHT
ZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.

It's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.

ANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.

Ahead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.

A nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out ANAKIN'S lightsaber.

OBI-WAN
Anakin!

ANAKIN
She went into that club, Master.

OBI-WAN
Patience.

OBI-WAN hands ANAKIN the lightsaber.

OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Here. Next time try not to lose it.

ANAKIN
Sorry, Master.

ANAKIN reaches for the lightsaber, but OBI-WAN holds it back.

OBI-WAN
A Jedi's saber is his most
precious possession.

ANAKIN
Yes, Master.

He reaches for the lightsaber, OBI-WAN pulls it back.

OBI-WAN
He must keep it with him at all
times.

ANAKIN
I know, Master.

OBI-WAN
This weapon is your life!

ANAKIN
I've heard this lesson before...

OBI-WAN finally holds out the lightsaber and ANAKIN grabs it.

OBI-WAN
But, you haven't learned anything,
Anakin.

ANAKIN
I try, Master.

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN enter the nightclub bar, and everyone stares at them

OBI-WAN
Why do I think you are going to be
the death of me?!

ANAKIN
Don't say that Master... You're
the closest thing I have to a
father... I love you. I don't want
to cause you pain.

OBI-WAN
Then why don't you listen to me?!

ANAKIN
I will. I'll do better, I promise.

OBI-WAN
Do you see him him?

ANAKIN
I think he's a she...

OBI-WAN
Then be extra careful...
(nods to a room)
Check it out.

OBI-WAN goes away.

ANAKIN
Where are you going, Master?

OBI-WAN
To get a drink.

OBI-WAN heads for the bar. ANAKIN blinks in surprise, then moves into the room, where ALIEN FACES look back at him with hostility, suspicion, and invitation as he moves among the tables. OBI-WAN arrives at the bar. He signals the BARMAN.

CLOSE - Somewhere in the room a HAND moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch. At the bar, a glass is placed in from of OBI-WAN. A drink is poured. He lifts the glass.

ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO
Wanna buy some death sticks?

OBI-WAN looks at him. He moves his fingers slightly.

OBI-WAN
You don't want to sell me death-
sticks.

ELAN
I don't want to sell you death-
sticks.

OBI-WAN moves his fingers.

OBI-WAN
You want to go home and rethink
your life.

ELAN
I want to go home and rethink my
life.

He leaves. OBI-WAN lifts the drink and tosses it back.

CLOSE. The gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight. The BOUNTY HUNTER starts to move toward the bar.

ANAKIN checks out ALIEN FACES. OBI-WAN signals for another drink. The gun moves toward his unsuspecting back.

The drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads.

The room is silent. ALIENS rise menacingly from their seats, and ANAKIN is suddenly at OBI-WAN's side, his lightsaber glowing.

ANAKIN
Easy... Official business. Go
back to your drinks.

Slowly, the ALIENS sit. Conversation resumes. Onstage, THE PERFORMERS pick up their routine. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lift ZAM and carry her out.

EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN carry ZAM into the alley and lower her to the ground. OBI-WAN attends to her wounded shoulder. She stares up hatefully at ANAKIN. She winces in pain, then nods.

OBI-WAN
Do you know who it was you were
trying to kill?

ZAM WESSEL
The Senator from Naboo.

OBI-WAN
Who hired you?

ZAM glares at OBI-WAN.

ZAM WESSEL
It was just a job.

ANAKIN
Tell us!

ZAM WESSEL
That Senator's gonna die soon
anyway, and the next one won't
make the same mistake I did...

OBI-WAN
This wound's going to need
treatment.

ANAKIN
Who hired you? Tell us... tell us
now!

ZAM glares hatefully.

ZAM
It was a Bounty Hunter called...

There is a sudden FTZZZ sound. ZAM twitches. She blinks in surprise and dies.

There is a WEOOSH from above. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up yo see an ARMOURED ROCKET-MAN taking off from a roof high above. OBI-WAN looks down at ZAM. He touches her neck and pulls out a small, wicked-looking dart.

OBI-WAN
Toxic Dart...

INT. SENATE BUILDING, AMIDALA'S APARTMENT - DAY
ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand near the door of the anteroom to PADME'S
bedroom. PADME and DORME move about packing luggage.

PADM 
Representative Binks. I know I can
count on you.

JAR JAR
Yousa betchen mesa bottums.

PADM 
What?!

JAR JAR
(coughs, recovers)
Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean,
I am honoured to accept this heavy
burden. I take on this
responsibility with deep humility
tinged with an overwhelming pride.
(pompously)
It is not every day that I am
called upon to...

PADME kisses him on the cheek and gives him a hug. JAR JAR turns red.

PADM 
You're a good friend, Jar Jar. I
don't wish to hold you up. I'm
sure you have a great deal to do.

JAR JAR
Of course, M'lady.

JAR JAR bows and goes out. As he passes ANAKIN, he flashes a dazzling smile... PADME is in a very bad mood.

PADM 
I do not like this idea of hiding.

ANAKIN
Don't worry. Now that the Council
has ordered an investigation, it
won't take Master Obi-Wan long to
find that bounty hunter.

PADM 
(frustrated)
I haven't worked for a year to
defeat the "Military Creation Act"
not to be here when its fate is
decided.

ANAKIN
Sometimes we have to let go of our
pride and do what is requested of
us.

PADM 
Pride?!? Annie, you're young, and
you don't have a very firm grip on
politics. I suggest you reserve
your opinions for some other time.

ANAKIN
Sorry, M'lady. I was only trying
to...

PADM 
Annie! No!

ANAKIN
Please don't call me that.

PADM 
What?

ANAKIN
Annie...

PADM 
I've always called you that... it
is your name, isn't it?

ANAKIN
It's Anakin. When you say Annie
it's like I'm still a little
boy... and I'm not.

PADM 
I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossible
to deny you've...
(looks him over)
...that you've grown up.

PADME smiles at ANAKIN. He becomes a little shy.

ANAKIN
Master Obi-Wan manages not to see
it...

PADM 
Mentors have a way of seeing more
of our faults than we would like.
It's the only way we grow.

ANAKIN
Don't get me wrong... Obi-Wan is
a great mentor. As wise as Master
Yoda and as powerful as Master
Windu. I am truly thankful to be
his apprentice. Only... although
I'm a Padawan learner, in some
ways... a lot of ways... I'm ahead
of him. I'm ready for the trials.
I know I am! He knows it too. He
believes I'm too unpredictable...
Other Jedi my age have gone
through the trials and made it...
I know I started my training
late... but he won't let me move
on.

PADM 
That must be frustrating.

ANAKIN
It's worse... he's overly
critical. He never listens! He
just doesn't understand! It's not
fair!

PADME cannot surpress a laugh. She shakes her head.

PADM 
I'm sorry... You sounded exactly
like that little boy I once knew,
when he didn't get his way.

ANAKIN
I'm not whining! I'm not.

PADME just smiles at him. DORME laughs in the background.

PADM 
I didn't say it to hurt you.

ANAKIN
I know...

There is a brief silence. PADME comes over to ANAKIN.

PADME
Anakin...

They look into each other's eyes for the first time.

PADM 
(continuing)
Don't try to grow up too fast.

ANAKIN
I am grown up. You said it
yourself.

ANAKIN looks deep into PADME'S eyes.

PADM 
Please don't look at me like that.

ANAKIN
Why not?

PADM 
Because I can see what you're
thinking.

ANAKIN
(laughing)
Ahh... so, you have Jedi powers
too?

DORME is watching with concern.

PADM 
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

ANAKIN
Sorry, M'lady.

ANAKIN backs away as PADME turns and goes back to her packing.

EXT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY
A small bus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of Coruscant's Industrial area. The spaceport is bustling with activity. Transports of various sizes moves supplies and passengers as giant floating cranes lift cargo out of starships. The bus stops before a huge intergalactic freighter starship. It parks in the shadows of an overhang.

INT. CORUSCANT, SPACEPORT FREIGHTER DOCKS, TRANSPORT BUS - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME, dressed in Outland peasant outfits, get up and head for the door where CAPTAIN TYPHO, DORME and OBI-WAN are waiting to hand them their luggage. DORME is dressed to look like Senator Amidala.

CAPTAIN TYPHO
Be safe, m'lady.

PADM 
Thank you, Captain. Take good
care of Dorme... the threat's on
you two now.

DORME
He'll be safe with me.

They laugh, and PADME embraces her faithful handmaiden. DORME start to weep.

PADM 
You'll be fine.

DORME
It's not me, M'Lady. I worry
about you. What if they realise
I'm not you?

PADM 
(looks to Anakin)
Then my Jedi protector will have
to prove how grown up he is.

DORME and PADME smile. ANAKIN frowns as OBI-WAN pulls him aside.

OBI-WAN
Anakin, you stay put on Naboo.
Do not attract any attention. Do
absolutely nothing without
checking in with me or the Council.

ANAKIN
Yes, Master.

OBI-WAN
(to Padme)
I will get to the bottom of this
plot quickly, M'Lady. You'll be
back here in no time.

PADM 
I will be most grateful for your
speed, Master Jedi.

ANAKIN
Time to go.

PADM 
I know.

PADME gives DORME a last hug. ANAKIN picks up the luggage, and the TWO PEASANTS exit the speeder bus, where ARTOO is waiting for them.

OBI-WAN
May the Force be with you.

ANAKIN
May the Force be with you, Master.

They head off toward the giant Starfreighter.

PADM 
Suddenly, I'm afraid...

ANAKIN
I'm kinda scared too. This is my
first assignment on my own.

PADM 
There's nothing to worry about...
we have Artoo with us.

The two laugh.

OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN TYPHO watch ANAKIN and PADME disappear into the
vastness of the spaceport with ARTOO trundling along behind them.

OBI-WAN
I hope he doesn't try anything
foolish.

CAPTAIN TYPHO
I'd be more concerned about her
doing something, than him.

EXT. FREIGHTER DOCKS - CORUSCANT - DAY
The freighter slowly takes off from the huge docks area of Coruscant. It soon moves into the crowded skies.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - LATE DAY
From high above, light streams down from the lofty ceilings. OBI-WAN crosses the floor of the great hallway, heaading for the Analysis Rooms.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ANALYSIS CUBICLES - LATE DAY
OBI-WAN walks past several glass cubicles where work is going on. He comes to an empty one and sits down in front of a console. A PK-4 ANALYSIS DROID comes to life. A tray slides out of the console.

PK-4
Place the subject for analysis on
the sensot tray, please.

OBI-WAN puts the dart onto the traym which retracts into the console. The DROID activates the system, and a screen lights up in from of OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN
It's a toxic dart. I need to know
where it came from and who made it.

PK-4
One moment, please.

Diagrams and .... appear on the screem, scrolling past at great speed. OBI-WAN watches as the screen goes blank. They tray slides out.

PK-4
(continuing)
As you can see on your screen,
subject weapon does not exist in
any known culture. Markings
cannot be identified. Probablt
self-made by a warrior not
associated with any known society.

OBI-WAN
Excuse me? Could you try again
please?

PK-4
Master Jedi, our records are very
thorough. they cover eight
percent of the galaxy. If I can't
tell you where it came from,
nobody can.

OBI-WAN picks up the dart and looks at it, then looks to the DROID.

OBI-WAN
Thanks for your assistance! You
may not be able to figure this
out, but I think I know someone
who might.

EXT. SPACE, STARSHIP FREIGHTER
The massive, slow-moving Freighter suddenly zooms away into lightspeed.

INT. STARFREIGHTER, STORAGE HOLD - DAY
The great, gloomy hold is crowded with EMIGRANTS and their belongings. To one side ARTOO is coming to the head of a food line, where SERVERS are ladling out bowls of mush. ARTOO holds two bowls.

SERVER
Keep moving! Keep moving!

ARTOO slips tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity. With one of his little claw-arms, he grabs several chunks of something that looks like brown bread. A SERVER sees him.

FOOD SERVER
(continuing)
Hey! No Droids!

ARTOO takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line. The SERVER shouts after him angrily. The little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping EMIGRANTS and comes to where ANAKIN is sound asleep. The young Jedi seems to be having a nightmare. He is very restless.

ANAKIN
No, no, Mom, no...

He is sweating. PADME leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his forehead. He wakes up with a start, then realises where he is. PADME simply looks at him. He stares back, somewhat confused. ARTOO fills up two bowls with mush.

ANAKIN
(continuing)
What?

PADM 
You seemed to be having a
nightmare.

ANAKIN looks at PADME a little more closely, trying to see if he has revealed any of his secrets. She hands him a bowl of mush and bread.

PADM 
(continuing)
Are you hungry?

ANAKIN
Thank you.

PADM 
We went into lightspeed a while
ago.

ANAKIN looks into PADME'S eyes.

ANAKIN
I look forward to seeing Naboo
again. I've thought about it every
day since I left. It's by far the
most beautiful place I've ever
seen...

PADME is a little unnerved by his intense stare.

PADM 
You were just a little boy then.
It may not be as you remember it;
time changes your perception.

ANAKIN
I think time has given me much
more mature feelings to enhance my
perception.

PADM 
It must be difficult having sworn
your life to the Jedi... not being
able to visit the places you
like... or do the things you
like...

ANAKIN
Or be with the people I love.

PADM 
Are you allowed to love? I
thought that was forbidden for a
Jedi.

ANAKIN
Attachment is forbidden.
Possession is forbidden.
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love, is central
to a Jedi's life, so you might say
we're encouraged to love.

PADM 
You have changed so much

ANAKIN
You haven't changed a bit. You're
exactly the way I remember you in
my dreams. I doubt if Naboo has
changed much either.

PADM 
It hasn't...

ANAKIN
I can't wait to breathe the sweet
breeze that comes off the rolling
hills. Whenever I try to
visualise the Force, those hills
are what I see.

ANAKIN looks at PADME when he says this.

ANAKIN
(continuing)
I love Naboo.

There is an awkward moment.

PADM 
(changing the subject)
Were you dreaming about you
mother earlier, weren't you?

ANAKIN
Yes... I left Tatooine so long
ago, my memory of her is fading.
I don't want to lose it. Recently
I've been seeing her in my
dreams... vivid dreams... scary
dreams. I worry about her.

PADME gives ANAKIN a sympathetic look.

EXT. CORUSCANT, DOWNTOWN, BACK STREET - MORNING
OBI-WAN walks down the street. It is a pretty tough part of town. Old buildings, warehouses, beat up speeders and transporter rigs occasional "shiny freighters" hissing through.

OBI-WAN comes to a kind of alien diner. On the steamed-up windowa it says "DEX'S DINER" in alien lettering. He goes inside.

INT. CORUSCANT, DEX'S DINER - MORNING
A young waitress, HERMIONE BAGWA, is wiping off a booth tabletop. There is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window. A number of CUSTOMERS are eating - TOUGH-LOOKING WORKERS, FREIGHTER DRIVERS etc. HERMIONE looks up as OBI-WAN comes in.

HERMIONE
Can I help ya?

OBI-WAN
I'm looking for Dexter.

HERMIONE'S eyes narrow.

HERMIONE BAGWA
Waddya want him for?

OBI-WAN
He's not in trouble. It's
personal.

HERMIONE stares at OBI-WAN. There is a brief pause. Then she goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter.

HERMIONE BAGWA
Someone to see ya, honey
(lowering her voice)
A Jedi, by the looks of him.

Steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through.

DEXTER JETTSTER
Obi-Wan!

OBI-WAN
Hey, Dex.

DEXTER JETTSTER
Take a seat! Be right with ya!

OBI-WAN sits in a booth.

HERMIONE BAGWA
You want a cup of ardees?

OBI-WAN
Thank you.

HERMIONE moves off as the door to the counter opens and DEXTER JETTSTER appears. He is big - bald and sweaty, old and alien. Not someone to tangle with. He arrives, beaming hugely.

DEXTER JETTSTER
Hey, ol' buddy!

OBI-WAN
Hey, Dex.

DEXTER eases himself into the seat opposite OBI-WAN. He can just make it. HERMIONE sets two mugs of steaming ardees in from of them.

DEXTER JETTSTER
So, my friend. What can I do for
ya?

OBI-WAN
You can tell me what this is.

OBI-WAN places the dart on the table between them. DEX'S eyes widen. He puts down his mug.

DEXTER JETTSTER
Well, whattaya know...

DEXTER picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and peers at it.

DEXTER JETTSTER
(continuing)
I ain't seen one of these since I
was prospecting on Subterrel
beyond the Outer Rim!

OBI-WAN
Do you know where it came from?

DEXTER grins. He puts the dart down between them.

DEXTER JETTSTER
This baby belongs to them cloners.
What you got here is a Kamino
Kyberdart.

OBI-WAN
Kamino Kyberdart... I wonder why
it didn't show up in any analysis
archive.

DEXTER JETTSTER
It's these funny little cuts on
the side give it away...
Those analysis droids you've got
over there only focus on symbols,
you know. I should think you Jedi
would have more respect for the
difference between knowledge and
wisdom.

OBI-WAN
Well, Dex, if droids could think, we
wouldn't be here, would we?
(laughing)
Kamino... doesn't sound familiar.
Is it part of the Republic?

DEXTER JETTSTER
No, it's beyond the Outer Rim.
I'd say about twelve parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze, toward the
south. It should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your
archive to find. Those Kaminoans
keep to themselves. They're
cloners. Damned good ones, too.

OBI-WAN then picks up the dart, holding it midway between them.

OBI-WAN
Cloners? Are they friendly?

DEXTER JETTSTER
It depends.

OBI-WAN
On what, Dex?

Dexter grins.

DEXTER JETTSTER
On how good your manners are...
and how big your pocketbook is...

EXT. NABOO SPACEPORT - DAY
The Starfreighter lands in the giant port city of Theed.

PADME, ANAKIN and ARTOO are among the EMIGRANTS streaming from the Starfreighter and into the vast docking area. They exit onto the main plaza.

EXT. NABOO PALACE, GRAND COURTYARD (NABOO) - AFTERNOON
The speeder bus pulls up and stops. PADME, ANAKIN, and ARTOO get out. The great courtyard stretches out before them, and they see the rose-colored dome of the palace on the far side. ARTOO WHISTLES. They pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard. ARTOO trundles behind them.

ANAKIN
If I grew up here, I don't think
I'd ever leave.

PADM 
(laughing)
I doubt that.

ANAKIN
No, really. When I started my
training, I was very homesick and
very lonely. This city and my Mom
were the only pleasant things I
had to think about... The problem
was, the more I thought about my
Mom, the worse I felt. But I
would feel better if I thought
about the palace - the way it
shimmers in the sunlight - the way
the air always smells of flowers...

PADM 
...and the soft sound of the
distant waterfalls. The first
time I saw the Capital, I was very
young... I'd never seen a
waterfall before. I though they
were so beautiful... I never
dreamed one day I'd live in the
palace.

ANAKIN
Well, tell me, did you dream of
power and politics when you were
a little girl?

PADM 
(laughing)
No! That was the last thing I
thought of. My dream was to help
in the "Refugee Relief Movement."
I never thought of running for
elected office. But the more
history I studied, the more I
realised how much good politicians
could do. So when I was eight, I
joined the "Apprentice
Legislators", then later on became
a Senatorial advisor, with such a
passion that, before I knew it, I
was elected Queen. Partly because
I scored so high on my education
certificate, but for the most part
it was my conviction that reform
was possible. I wasn't the
youngest Queen ever elected, but
now that I think back on it, I'm
not sure I was old enough. I'm not
sure I was ready.

ANAKIN
The people you served thought you
did a good job. I heard they
tried to amend the Constitution so
you could stay in office.

PADM 
Popular rule is not democracy,
Annie. It gives the people what
they want, not what they need.
And, truthfully, I was relieved
when my two terms were up. So
were my parents. They worried
About me during the blockade and
couldn't wait for it all to be
over. Actually, I was hoping to
have a family by now... My
sisters have the most amazing,
wonderful kids... but when the
Queen asked me to serve as
Senator, I couldn't refuse her.

ANAKIN
I agree! I think the Republic
needs you... I'm glad you chose
to serve. I feel things are going
to happen in our generation that
will change the galaxy in profound
ways.

PADM 
I think so too.

ANAKIN and PADME walk toward the palace. ARTOO continues to follow.

INT. NABOO PALACE, THRONE ROOM - AFTERNOON
QUEN JAMILLIA is seated on the throne, flanked by SIO BIBBLE and a COUPLE OF ADVISORS. FOUR HANDMAIDENS stand close by, and GUARDS are at the doors.

QUEEN JAMILLIA
We've been worried about you.
(takes her hand)
I'm so glad you're safe, Padm .

PADM 
Thank you, Your Highness. I only
Wish I could have served you
better by staying on Coruscant for
the vote.

SIO BIBBLE
Given the circumstances, Senator,
you know it was the only decision
Her Highness could have made.

QUEEN JAMILLIA
How many systems have joined Count
Dooku and the separatists?

PADM 
About two hundred. And more are
leaving the Republic every day.
If the Senate votes to create an
army, I'm sure it's going to push
us into a civil war.

SIO BIBBLE
It's unthinkable! There hasn't
been a full-scale war since the
formation of the Republic!

QUEEN JAMILLIA
Do you see any way, through
negotiations, to bring the
separatists back into the Republic?

PADM 
Not if they feel threatened. The
separatists don't have an army,
but if they are provoked, they
will move to defend themselves.
I'm sure of that. And with no time
or money to build an army, my
guess is they will turn to the
Commerce Guilds or the Trade
Federation for help.

QUEEN JAMILLIA
The armies of commerce! Why has
Nothing been done in the Senate
to restrain them?

PADM 
I'm afraid that, despite the
Chancellor's best efforts, there
are still many bureaucrats,
judges, and even Senators on the
payrolls of the Guilds.

SIO BIBBLE
It's outrageous! After all of
those hearings, and the four trials in
the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is
still the Viceroy of the Trade
Federation. Do those money
mongers control everything?

QUEEN JAMILLIA
Remember, Counsellor, the courts
were able to reduce the
Federation's armies. That's a
move in the right
direction.

PADM 
There are rumours, Your Highness,
that the Federation Army was not
reduced as they were ordered.

ANAKIN
The Jedi have not been allowed to
investigate. It would be to be too
dangerous for the economy, we were
told.

QUEEN JAMILLIA
We must keep our faith in the
Republic. The day we stop
believing democracy can work is
the day we lose it.

PADM 
Let's pray that day never comes.

QUEEN JAMILLIA
In the meantime, we must consider
your own safety.

SIO BIBBLE signals. All the other ADVISORS and ATTENDANTS bow and leave the room.

SIO BIBBLE
(to Anakin)
What is your suggestion, Master
Jedi?

PADM 
Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor.
He's still a Padawan learner. I
was thinking...

ANAKIN
(nettled)
Hey, hold on a minute!

PADM 
Excuse me! I was thinking I would
stay in the Lake Country. There
are some places up there that are
very isolated.

ANAKIN
Excuse me?! I am in charge of
security here, M'Lady.

SIO BIBBLE and QUEEN JAMILLIA exchange a look. Something is going on here.

PADM 
Annie, my life is at risk, and
this is my home. I know it very
well... that is why we're here.
I think it would be wise for you
to take advantage of my knowledge
in this instance.

ANAKIN
(takes a deep breath)
Sorry, M'Lady.

SIO BIBBLE
(to Anakin, amused)
She is right. The Lake Country is
the most remote part of Naboo.
Not many people and a clear view
of the surrounding terrain.

QUEEN JAMILLIA
Perfect. It's settled then.

ANAKIN glares at PADME. Then QUEEN JAMILLIA gets up, and they all start to leave.

QUEEN JAMILLIA
(continued)
Padm , I had an audience with your
father yesterday. I told him what
was happening. He hopes you will
visit your mother before you
leave... your family's very
worried about you.

PADME looks worred. They ALL exit down the main staircase.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
The main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with activity. All sorts of JEDI are coming and going.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, ARCHIVES LIBRARY - DAY
A bronze bust of Count Dooku, stands among a line of other busts of Jedi in the Archive Room. OBI-WAN stands in front it, studying the striking features of the chiselled face.

On the walls, lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity. Farther along the room in the background, FIVE JEDI are seated at tables, studying archival material.

After OBI-WAN studies the bust for a few moments before MADAME JOCASTA NU, the Jedi Archivist is standing next to him. She is an elderly, frail-looking human Jedi. Tough as old boots and smart as a whip.

JOCASTA NU
Did you call for assistance?

OBI-WAN
(distracted in thought)
Yes... yes, I did...

JOCASTA NU
He has a powerful face, doesn't
he? He was one of the most
brilliant Jedi I have had the
privilege of knowing.

OBI-WAN
I never understood why he quit.
Only twenty Jedi have ever left
the Order.

JOCASTA NU
(sighs)
The Lost Twenty... and Count Dooku
was the most recent and the most
painful. No one likes to talk
about it. His leaving was a great
loss to the Order.

OBI-WAN
What happened?

JOCASTA NU
Well, one might say, he was always
a bit out of step with the
decisions of the Council... much
like your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.

OBI-WAN
(surprised)
Really?

JOCASTA NU
Oh, yes. They were alike in many
ways. Very individual thinkers...
idealists...

JOCASTA NU stares at the bust

JOCASTA NU
(continuing
He was always striving to become
a more powerful Jedi. He wanted
to be the best. With a lightsaber,
in the old style of fencing, he
had no match. His knowledge of
the Force was... unique. In the
end, I think he left because he
lost faith in the Republic. He
believed that politics were
corrupt, and he felt the Jedi
betrayed themselves by serving the
politicians. He always had very
high expectations of government.
He disappeared for nine or ten
years, then he just showed up
recently as the head of the
separatist movement.

OBI-WAN
Interesting... I'm still not sure
I understand.

JOCASTA NU
Well, I'm sure you didn't call me
over here for a history lesson.
Are you having a problem, Master
Kenobi?

OBI-WAN
Yes, I'm trying to find a planet
system called Kamino. It doesn't
seem to show upon any of the
archive charts.

JOCASTA NU
Kamino? It's not a system I'M
familiar with... Let me see...

JOCASTA NU leans over OBI-WAN'S shoulder, looking at the screen.

JOCASTA NU
(continuing)
Are you sure you have the right
co-ordinates?

OBI-WAN
(nodding)
According to my information, it
should be in this quadrant
somewhere... just south of the
Rishi Maze.

JOCASTA NU taps the keyboard and frowns.

JOCASTA NU
No co-ordinates? It sounds like the
kind of directions you'd get from
a street tout... some old miner or
Furbog trader.

OBI-WAN
All three actually.

JOCASTA NU
Are you sure it exists?

OBI-WAN
Absolutely.

JOCASTA NU
Let me do a gravitational scan.

OBI-WAN and JOCASTA NU studt the star map hologram.

JOCASTA NU
There are some inconsistencies
here. Maybe the planet you're
looking for was destroyed.

OBI-WAN
Wouldn't that be on record?

JOCASTA NU
It ought to be. Unless it was very
recent.
(shakes her head)
I hate to say it, but it looks
like the system you're searching
for doesn't exist.

OBI-WAN
That's impossible... perhaps the
archives are incomplete.

JOCASTA NU
The archives are comprehensive and
totally secure, my young Jedi.
One thing you may be absolutely
sure of - if an item does not
appear in our records, it does not
exist!

OBI-WAN stares at her, then looks back at the map.

EXT. THEED, RESIDENTIAL AREA, SIDE STREET - AFTERNOON
PEOPLE are passing through the little street, OLD MEN are sunning themslves, WOMEN are gossipping, KIDS are playing. ANAKIN, PADME and ARTOO turn onto a side street. ANAKIN is back in his Jedi robes. PADME wear a beautiful simple dress. She stops, beaming.

PADME
There's my house!

PADME starts forward; ANAKIN hangs back.

PADME
(continuing)
What? Don't say you're shy!

ANAKIN
(untruthfully)
No, but I...

Suddenly, there are shouts from two little girils, RYOO (age 6) and POOJA (age 4). They come running toward PADME.

RYOO   POOJA
Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!

PADME
Ryoo!! Pooja!!

PADME scoops up RYOO and POOJA and hugs them.

PADME
(continuing)
I'm so happy to see you! This is
Anakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, and
this is Pooja.

ANAKIN and the GIRLS say hello shyly. Then:

RYOO   POOJA
Artoo!!!

As they see the droid, they hug him. ARTOO WHISTLES and BEEPS. PADME laughs. ANAKIN and PADME go on toward the house. The GIRLS stay and play with ARTOO.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON
SOLA, PADME'S beautiful older sister, comes in from the kitchen carrying a big bowl of food.

SOLA
(over her shoulder)
They're eating over at Jev
Narran's later, Mom. They just
had a snack. They'll be fine.

SOLA puts the bowl down on the table, where ANAKIN, PADME and RUWEE NABERRIE (Padme's father) are coming into the room.

PADME
Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.

SOLA
Hello, Anakin.

ANAKIN
Hello.

SOLA sits, as JOBAL NABERRIE (Padme's mother) comes in with a heaped bowl of steaming food.

JOBAL
You're just in time for dinner. I
hope you're hungry, Anakin.

ANAKIN
A little.

PADME
He's being polite, Mom. We're
starving.

RUWEE
(grinning)
You came to the right place at the
right time. Sit down, son.

EVERYONE sits and starts passing food.

JOBAL
(to Padme)
Honey, it's so good to see you
safe. We were so worried.

PADME gives JOBAL a dirty look. RUWEE smiles as he watches.

RUWEE
Dear...

JOBAL
I know, I know... but I had to say
it. Now it's done.

SOLA
Well, this is exciting! Do you
know, Anakin, you're the first
boyfriend my sister's ever brought
home?

PADME
(rolls her eyes)
Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend!
He's a Jedi assigned by the Senate
to protect me.

JOVAL
A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! They
didn't tell us it was that serious!

PADME
It's not, Mom, I promise.
(glances at Jobal)
Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I've
known him for years. Remember
that little boy who was with the
Jedi during the blockade crisis?

They nod.

PADME
(continuing)
He grew up.

JOBAL
Honey, when are you going to
settle down? Haven't you had
enough of that life? I certainly
have!

PADME
Mom, I'm not in any danger.

RUWEE
(to Anakin)
Is she?

ANAKIN
...Yes... I'm afraid she is.

PADME
(quickly)
But not much.

EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking.

RUWEE
Sometimes I wish I'd traveled
more... but I must say, I'm happy
here.

ANAKIN
Padme tells me you teach at the
university?

RUWEE
(nodding)
Yes, and before that, I was a
builder. I also worked for the
Refugee Relief Movement, when I
was very young.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON
PADME, SOLA and JOBAL are clearing the table.

SOLA
Why haven't you told us about him?

PADM 
What's there to talk about?  He's
just a boy.

SOLA
A boy? Have you seen the way he
looks at you?

PADM 
Sola - stop it!

SOLA
It's obvious he has feelings for
you. Are you saying, little baby
sister, that you haven't noticed?

PADM 
I'm not your baby sister, Sola.
Anakin and I are friends... our
relationship is strictly
professional.
(to Jobal)
Mom, would you tell her to stop it?

SOLA
(laughing)
Well, maybe you haven't noticed
the way he looks at you. I think
you're afraid to.

PADM 
Cut it out.

JOBAL
Sola's just concerned... we all
are.

PADM 
Oh, Mom, you're impossible. What
I'm doing is important.

JOBAL
You've done your service, Padm .
It's time you had a life of your
own. You're missing so much!

EXT. PADME'S PARENTS' GARDEN - AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and RUWEE are walking in the garden. RUWEE stops and faces ANAKIN directly.

RUWEE
Now tell me, son. How serious is
this thing? How much danger is my
daughter really in?

ANAKIN
There have been two attempts on
her life. Chances are there'll be
more. My Master is tracking down
the assassins. I'm sure he'll find
out who they are. This situation,
won't last long.

RUWEE
I don't want anything to happen to
her.

ANAKIN
I don't either.

INT. PADME'S PARENTS' HOUSE, PADME'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
PADME throws some things into a bag.

PADME
Don't worry, this won't take long.

ANAKIN
I just want to get there before
dark.

PADME goes on packing. ANAKIN looks around the room.

ANAKIN
(continuing)
You still live at home.

PADME
I move around so much, I've never
had a place of my own. Official
residences have no warmth. I feel
good here. I feel at home.

ANAKIN
I never had a real home. Home was
always where my Mom was.

ANAKIN picks up a framed hologram.

ANAKIN
(continuing)
Is this you?

The hologram shows Padme at age seven or eight surrounded by forty or fifty little green creatures. She is holding one in her arms. They are all smiling hugely.

PADME
That was when I went with the
Relief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran.
Their sun was imploding, and the
planet was dying. I was helping
to relocate the children. See
that little one I'm holding? His
name was N'a-kee-tula, which means
sweethear. He was so full of
life,. All those kids were. I did
everything I could to save him,
but he died... they all did. They
were never able to adapt... to
live off their native planet.

ANAKIN picks up another hologram. It shows PADME at age ten or eleven. She is wearing official robes and standing between two robed legislators. Her expression is severe.

PADME
(continuing)
My first day as an Apprentice
Legislator. Notice the difference?

PADME pulls a face. ANAKIN grins. She continues packing. ANAKIN sets the two holograms down side by side - the beaming little girl, and the the stern, unsmiling adolescent.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, MAIN HALLWAY - DAY
OBI-WAN walks through the main hallway to the training area.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, TRAINING VERANDA - DAY
OBI-WAN comes out onto the veranda and stops, watching TWENTY or so FOUR-YEAR-OLDS doing training exercises, supervised by YODA. They wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little TRAINING DROIDS with their miniature lightsabers. The DROIDS dance in front of them.

YODA
Don't think... feel... be as one
with the Force. Help you, it will.
(he sees Obi-Wan)
Younglings - enough! A visitor we
have. Welcome him.

The CHILDREN take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers.

YODA
(continuing)
Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet the
mighty Bear Clan.

CHILDREN
Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!

OBI-WAN
I am sorry to disturb you, Master.

YODA
What help to you, can I be?

OBI-WAN
I m looking for a planet described
to me by an old friend. I trust
him. But the system doesn t show
up on the archive maps.

YODA
An interesting puzzle. Gather
round the map reader, younglings.
Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet.
Find it, we will try...

The map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top. The CCHILDREN gather around it. OBI-WAN takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl. The window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up, projecting the star map hologram into the room. The CHILDREN laugh. Some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars. OBI-WAN walks into the display.

OBI-WAN
This is where it ought to be...
but it isn t. Gravity is pulling
all the stars in this area inward
to this spot. There should be a
star here... but there isn t.

YODA
Most interesting. Gravity s
silhouette remains, but the star
and all its planets have
disappeared. How can this be?

There is a brief pause. Then a CHILD puts its hand up. YODA nods.

JEDI CHILD JACK
Because someone erased it from the
archive memory.

CHILDREN
That s right! Yes! That s what
happened! Someone erased it!

JEDI CHILD MAY
If the planet blew up, the gravity
would go away.

OBI-WAN stares; YODA chuckles.

YODA
Truly wonderful, the mind of a
child is. Uncluttered. To the
centre of the pull of gravity go,
and find your planet you will.

OBI-WAN
But Master Yoda who could have
erased information from the
archives? That s impossible,
isn t it?

YODA
(frowning)
Much harder to answer, that
question is.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, WATER SPEEDER, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
A water speeder driven by PADDY ACCU, the retreat caretaker, skims across the lake away from the island landing platform where a chrome Naboo Starship rests. ANAKIN and PADME are sitting in the speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful island in the middle of the lake.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN TERRACEM LATE AFTERNOON
ANAKIN and PADME walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden. Behind them, PADDY ACCU supervises two serving girls, NANDI and TECKLA, as they carry the bags into the Lodge.

ANAKIN and PADME stop at the balustrade. PADME looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond. ANAKIN looks at her silently.

PADM 
When I was in Level Three, we used
to come here for school retreat.
See that island? We used to swim
there every day. I love the water.

ANAKIN
I do too. I guess it comes from
growing up on a desert planet.

PADME becomes aware that ANAKIN is looking at her.

PADM 
...We used to lie on the sand and
let the sun dry us... and try to
guess the names of the birds
singing.

ANAKIN
I don t like sand. It s coarse
and rough and irritating, and it
gets everywhere. Not like here.
Here everything s soft... and
smooth...

He touches her arm. PADME has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous.

PADM 
There was a very old man who lived
on the island. He used to make
glass out of sand - and vases and
necklaces out of the glass. They
were magical.

ANAKIN
(looks into her eyes)
Everything here is magical.

PADM 
You could look into the glass and
see the water. The way it ripples
and moves. It looked so real...
but it wasn t.

ANAKIN
Sometimes, when you believe
something to be real, it becomes
real. Real enough, anyway...

They look into each other's eyes. He touches her chin.

PADM 
I used to think if you looked too
deeply into glass, you would
lose yourself.

ANAKIN
I think it's true...

ANAKIN kisses PADME. She doesn't resist. She comes to her senses and pulls away.

PADM 
I shouldn't have done that.

ANAKIN
I'm sorry. When I'm around you,
my mind is no longer my own.

PADM 
It's the situation... the stress...

He looks at her.

ANAKIN
...the view.

EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON
Obi-Wan's Starfighter is ready for takeoff. OBI-WAN and MACE WINDU stand beside it.

MACE WINDU
Be wary, this disturbance in the
Force is growing stronger.

OBI-WAN
I am concerned for my Padawan. He
is not ready to be on his own.

YODA
The Council is confident in this decision,
Obi-Wan.

MACE
He has exceptional skills. The
Council is confident in its
decision, Obi-Wan. If the
prophecy is true, he weill be the
one to bring balance to the Force.

OBI-WAN
But he still has much to learn.
And his abilities have made him...
well... arrogant. I realise now
what you and Master Yoda knew from
the beginning... the boy was too
old to start the training and...

OBI-WAN hesitates.

MACE WINDU
There's something else?

OBI-WAN
Master, he should not have been
given this assignment. I'm afraid
Anakin won't be able to protect
the Senator.

MACE WINDU
Why?

OBI-WAN
He has a... an emotional
connection with her. It's been
there since he was boy. Now
he's confused... distracted.

MACE-WINDU
Obi-Wan, you must have faith that
he will take the right path.

OBI-WAN climbs into the cockpit of the Starfighter.

OBI-WAN
Has Master Yoda gained any insight
into whether or not this war will
come about?

MACE WINDU
Probing the Dark Side is a
dangerous process. He could be in
seclusion for days... May the
force be with you.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, YODA'S QUARTERS - LATE AFTERNOON
YODA sits with his eyes closed, meditating. Silence.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LOUNGE, LATE AFTERNOON
The setting sun touches the mountain peaks. The lake glows in the rose-tinted light. Floatinf lamps glean softly like jewels at the lodge.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
NANDI place dessert in front of PADME. TECKLA does the same for ANAKIN. The dessert is some kind of fruit. PADME picks up her fork and goes to spear a piece, but it moves! She frowns and tries again -the fruit moves. She lokk up at ANAKIN. His eyes are on his plate.

PADME
You did that?

ANAKIN looks up - wide-eyed innocence.

ANAKIN
What?

PADME scowls at him. PADME jabs at the fruit - ANAKIN subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her.

PADME
That! Now stop it!

PADME laughs. ANAKIN laughs. She reaches out for the fruit - it loops.

PADME
(continuing)
Anakin!!

ANAKIN moves his fingers. The fruit flies into his hand.

ANAKIN
I'm not really supposed to do
that... for fun, I mean. If
Master Obi-Wan were here, he'd be
very grumpy.

ANAKIN is pleased. He cuts the fruint into several pieces and sends one back to PADME. She bites it out of the air and laughs.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, FIREPLACE ALCOVE - TWILIGHT
A fire blazes in the open hearth. PADME is sitting in front of it, gazing at the flames.

She looks up as ANAKIN arrives. She makes room for him. Brief pause.

ANAKIN
May I tell you something?

PADME
I don't know.

ANAKIN
Then how can I tell you?

PADME
Maybe you should use your Jedi
intuition.

ANAKIN
It doesn't work around you. My
mind is always a muddle... I can
only think of you.

PADME
Anakin, don't...

ANAKIN
From the moment I met you, all
those years ago, a day hasn't gone
by when I haven't thought of you.
And now that I'm close to you again,
I'm in agony. The closer I get to
you, the worse it gets. The
thought of not being with you
mskes my stomach turn over - my
mouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. I
can't breathe. I'm haunted by the
kiss you should never have given
me. My heart is beating, hoping
that kiss will not become a scar.
You are in my very soul,
tormenting me. What can I do? I
will do anything you ask...

Silence. The logs flame in the hearth.

ANAKIN
(continuing)
If you are suffering as much as I
am, tell me.

PADME
...I can't. We can't. It's just
not possible.

ANAKIN
Anything's possible. Padme,
please listen...

PADME
You listen. We live in a real
world. Come back to it. You're
studying to become a Jedi Knight.
I'm a Senator. If you follow your
thoughts through to conclusion,
they will take us to a place we
cannot go... regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

ANAKIN
Then you do feel something!
There's an extraordinary
connection between us. You can't
deny that.

PADME
Annie, it doesn't make any
difference. Jedi aren't allowed
to marry. You swore an oath,
remember? You'd be expelled from
the Order. I will not let you
give up your responsibilities...
your future, for me.

ANAKIN
I was destined to be a Jedi. I
don't think I could be anything
else. But you are asking me to be
rational. That is something I
know I cannot do. I wish I could
wish my feelings away... but I
can't.

PADME
I am not going to give into this.
I'm not going to throw my life
away. I have more important things
to do than fall in love.

There is silence as they stare at the fire. ANAKIN is thinking.

ANAKIN
It wouldn't have to be that way...
we could keep it a secret.

PADME
Then we'd be living a lie - one we
couldn't keep even if we wanted
to. Mt sister saw it. So did my
mother. I couldn't do that.
Could you, Anakin? Could you live
like that?

Silence for a moment.

ANAKIN
...No, you're right. It would
destroy us.

EXT. SPACE
It's just like the star map hologram, plus the storm-shrouded planet of Kamino, which is exactly where it ought to be. Obi-Wan's Starship flies OVER CAMERA and heads down toward the planet.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
Heavy rans and hard-driving winds lash the platform as Obi-Wan's Starship approaches. The huge, ultra-modern city of Tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever-present waves that cover the surface of this watery world.

The Starfighter lands. OBI-WAN gets out and makes his way through the bowling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform. A door slides open. A shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain. OBI-WAN passes through it and goes inside.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR ENTRANCE
A Brilliant white light. OBI-WAN pushes the soaking hood from his face.

TAUN WE
Welcome to Tipoca City, Master
Jedi.

OBI-WAN wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall, pasty-white alien named TAUN WE. He has large, almond shaped eyes.

TAUN WE
Everything is ready. The Prime
Minister expects you.

OBI-WAN
(warily)
I'm expected?

TAUN WE
Of course! He is anxious to see
you. After all these years, we
were beginning to think you
weren't coming. Now please, this
way!

OBI-WAN masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor.

Obi-Wan follows Taun We cautiously.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, PRIME MINISTER OFFICE - DAY
The door slides open. OBI-WAN and TAUN WE enter and cross to where LAMA SU rises, smiling, from behind his desk, which, like all the furniture on Kamino, seems made out of pure light.

TAUN WE
May I present Lama Su, Prime
Minister of Kamino... and this is
Master Jedi...

OBI-WAN
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

LAMA SU
Please...

LAMA SU indicates a chair. OBI-WAN sits. TAUN WE hovers. The room is bathed in brilliant white light. The whole place is ultra high-tech.

LAMA SU
I trust you are going to enjoy
your stay. We are most happy you
have arrived at the best part of
the season.

OBI-WAN
You make me feel most welcome.

LAMA SU
And now to business. You will be
delighted to hear we are on
schedule. Two hundred thousand
units are ready, with another
million well on the way.

OBI-WAN
(improvising)
That is... good news.

LAMA SU
Please tell your Master Sido-Dyas
that we have every confidence his
order will be met on time and in
full. He is well, I hope?

OBI-WAN
I'm sorry Master - ?

LAMA SU
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's still
a leading member of the Jedi
Council, is he not?

OBI-WAN
Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas.

LAMA SU
(rising)
You must be anxious to inspect the
units for yourself.

OBI-WAN
That's why I'm here.

EXT. NABOO, MOUNTAIN MEADOW - LATER AFTERNOON
PADME and ANAKIN are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow, its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers. At a distance, a herd of SHAAKS graze contentedly.

Beyond is the shimmering expanse of the lake. Several other lakes stretch to the horizon. The warm air is full of little floating puffballs. They sit on the grass, in a playful, coy mood, talking. PADME is picking flowers.

PADM 
I don't know...

ANAKIN
Sure you do... you just don't want
to tell me.

PADM 
Are you going to use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?

ANAKIN
They only work on the weak-minded.
You are anything but weak-minded.

PADM 
All right... his name was Palo.
I was twelve. We were both in the
Legislative Youth Program. He was
a few years older then I... very
cute... dark curly hair... dreamy
eyes.

ANAKIN
All right, I get the picture...
whatever happened to him?

PADM 
I went on to become a Queen. He
went on to become an artist.

ANAKIN
Maybe he was the smart one.

PADME
You really don't like politicians,
do you?

ANAKIN
I like two or three, but I'm not
really sure about one of them.
(smiling)
I don't think the system works.

PADME
How would you have it work?

ANAKIN
We need a system where the
politicians sit down and discuss
the problems, agree what's in the
best interests of all the people,
and then do it.

PADME
That is exactly what we do. The
trouble is that people don't
wlways agree. In fact, they
hardly ever do.

ANAKIN
Then they should be made to.

PADME
By whom? Who's going to make them?

ANAKIN
I don't know. Someone.

PADME
You?

ANAKIN
Of course not me.

PADME
But someone.

ANAKIN
Someone wise.

PADME
That sounds an awful lot like a
dictatorship to me.

A mischievious little grin creeps across his face.

ANAKIN
Well, if it works...

PADME stares at ANAKIN. He looks back at her, straight-faced, and can't hold a smile.

PADM 
You're making fun of me.

ANAKIN
(sarcastic)
On no, I'd be much too frightened
to tease a Senator.

PADM 
You're so bad!

PADME picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him. He catches it. PADME throws two more pieces of fruit, and ANAKIN catches them.

ANAKIN
You're always so serious. Always
carrying the weight of the
universe on your shoulders.

ANAKIN then starts to juggle the fruit. PADME laughs and throws more fruit at him. He manages to juggle them too until there are too many, and he loses control and ducks, letting food fall on his head. They both laugh.

ANAKIN stands in front of a SHAAK, yelling at it and waving his arms. PADME starts laughing as ANAKIN runs in circles, chased by the SHAAK.

The SHAAK crosses in front of PADME. ANAKIN is riding it, facing the SHAAK'S tail. The SHAAK bucks, and ANAKIN falls off. PADME laughs even harder. ANAKIN lies still. PADME jumps uip and runs to where ANAKIN is face down in the grass. She turns him over. He is pulling a stupid face at her. She yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him. He catches her arm. She struggles. They roll over in the grass. Suddenly, they become aware of the contact between them. They let go of each other quickly and sit up, looking away.

ANAKIN stands up and holds out his hand to her. She take it. He pulls her up. And now they are easy together, not self-conscious any more. PADME scrambles up onto the SHAAK behind ANAKIN. She puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back. ABAJUB digs his heels in. The SHAAK starts forward, and they ride away.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, PARADE GROUND (RAINSTORM) - DAY
OBI-WAN, LAMA SU and TAUN WE come out onto a balcony. Below is a huge parade ground. The rain and wind are brutal. THOUSANDS OF STORMTROOPERS, faces covered by helmets, are marching and drilling in formations of several hundred.

LAMA SU
(beaming)
Magnificent, aren't they?

OBI-WAN nods slowly.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, COMMINSSARY - DAY
LAMA SU conducts OBI-WAN through a large eating area. TAUN WE follows as they walk by HUNDREDS OF CLONES who look exactly alike, all about twenty years old, dressed in black. They are seated at tables, eating.

LAMA SU
We modified their genetic
structure to make them less
independent than the original
host. As a result they are
totally obedient, taking any order
without question.

OBI-WAM
Who was the original host?

LAMA SU
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.
We felt a Jedi would be the
perfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand-
picked Jango Fett himself.

OBI-WAN
Where is this bounty hunter now?

LAMA SU
Oh, we keep him here. After a few
hundred thousand clones, the
genetic pattern starts to fade, so
we take a fresh supply. He lives
here, but he's free to come and go
as he pleases.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, BARRACKS - DAY
The tour continues through a long corridor folled with narrow, transparent tubes into which CLONES are climbing. Once in the tube, the CLONE goes to sleep.

LAMA SU
Apart from his pay, which is
considerable, Fett demanded only
one thing - an unaltered clone for
himself. Curious isn't it?

OBI-WAN
Unaltered?

LAMA SU
Pure genetic replication. No
tampering with the structure to
make it more docile... and no
growth acceleration...

OBI-WAN
I would like to meet this Jango
Fett.

TAUN WE
I would be most happy to arrange
it, for you.

TAUN WE bows, and leaves.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, CLASSROOM - DAY
The tour continues through a classroom filled with IDENTICAL YOUNG BOY CLONES.

OBI-WAN
You mentioned growth
acceleration...

LAMA SU
Oh yes, it's essential.
Otherwise, a mature clone would
take a lifetime to grow. Now, we
can do it in half the time. Those
items you saw on the parade ground
were started ten years ago, when
Sido-dyas first placed the order,
and they're already mature...

OBI-WAN looks at the BOY CLONES.

OBI-WAN
And these?

LAMA SU
About five years ago.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CLONE CENTER, HATCHERY - DAY
They enter a space filled with great racks of glass spheres, which are filled with fluid in which EMBRYOS are suspended.

LAMA SU
They're immensely superior to
droids, capable of independent
thought and action.

OBI-WAN
Very impressive.

LAMA SU
I'd hoped you would be pleased.

OBI-WAN gazes at the nearest embryos.

OBI-WAN
(carefully)
Tell me, prime minister, when my
Master Sido-dyas first contacted
you, did he say the order was
for... himself... or?

LAMA SU
Himself? Of course not. This
army is for the Republic?

OBI-WAN
(astonished)
The Repubic?

LAMA SU
We are also very much agasint this
Count Dooku and his seccessionist
movement. We are proud to be of
help to the Republic.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT - LATE DAY
TAUN WE shows OBI-WAN into his room.

TAUN WE
I have arranged for you to meet
Jango Fett in the morning. Sleep
well.

TAUN WE goes. The door slides closed behind him. OBI-WAN looks around, then moves swiftly to check the room over. Finally, satisfied, he takes out his comlink.

OBI-WAN
Arfour, Arfour...

EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) - LATE DAY
The R4 D17, Obi-Wan's Astro-Droid, who is sitting on top of Obi-Wan's Starfighter, switches on and BEEPS.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, APARTMENT - LATE DAY
OBI-WAN hears ARFOUR BEEP through his comlink.

OBI-WAN
Arfour, relay this, "scramble code
five," to Courscant: care of "the
old folks home."

EXT. TIPOCA CITY LANDING PLATFORM, JEDI FIGHTER, (RAINSTORM) - LATE DAY
ARFOUR BEEPS and WHISTLES. The panels light up inside the cockpit, as the message is transmitted.

EXT. JEDI TEMPLE, LIVINF QUARTERS - EARLY EVENING
YODA and MACE WINDU listen as a hologram of OBI-WAN stands between them broadcasting the massage. The singnal is very weak, the image fades in and out.

OBI-WAN (V.O.)
...I've never heard of a Jedi
called Sido-Dyas, have you, Master?

MACE WINDU
No. Whoever placed that order was
not a Jedi, I can assure you.

OBI-WAN (V.O.)
I have a strong feeling that this
bounty hunter is the assassin
we're looking for.

YODA
Who he is working for... discover
that, you must.

OBI-WAN (V.O.)
I will, Master, and I will also
find out more about this clone
army... May The Force...

The hologram switches off, and OBI-WAN fades away.

WINDU
A clone army! Ordered by someone
in the Senate perhaps... Someone's
out to start a war.

YODA
Inform the chancellor of this, we
must.

WINDU
Who do you think this impostor
Sido-Dyas, could be?

YODA stares back at MACE WINDU, then slowly shakes his head.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT - NIGHT
The silent lodge. The triple moons of Naboo reflected in the tranquil waters of the lake.

INT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, ANAKIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
ANAKIN moves restlessly in his sleep. He mutters to himself. Sweat
forms on his forehead. He turns violently. He cries out.

ANAKIN
No...No...No...Mom!...Don't,
no, don't!

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, BALCONY OVERLOOKING GARDENS - MORNING
ANAKIN is on the balcony overlooking the gardens. After a moment, PAMDE comes onto the balcony behind him. She sees he is meditating and turns to go.

ANAKIN
(eyes closed)
Don't go.

PAMDE
I don't want to disturb you.

ANAKIN
Your presence is soothing.

Brief pause.

PADME
You had a nightmare again last
night.

ANAKIN
Jedi don't have nightmares.

PADME
I heard you.

ANAKIN'S opens his eyes and looks at her.

ANAKIN
I saw my mother. I saw her as
clearly as I see you now. She's
suffering, Padme. She is in
pain...They're killing her!
(getting up)
I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator. I know I
will be punished and possibly
thrown out of the Jedi Order, but
I must go. I have to help her!
I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have a
choice.

PADME
Annie, I told you I wouldn't let
you give up your future for me.
I'll go with you. That way you
can continue to protect me, and
you won't be disobeying your
mandate.

ANAKIN
What about Master Obi-wan?

PADME smiles and takes his hand.

PADME
I guess we won't tell him, will we?

EXT. NABOO LAKE, FLOATING LANDING PLATFORM - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME step onto the landing platform from the water speeder. They enter the Naboo Starship. ARTOO BEEPS, and follows them on board. The ramp retracts.

PADDY ACCU drives the water speeder away from the platform as Anakin's Starship takes off.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY
Rain lashes the city. Below, mightly waves pound the stilts, breaking almost to the height of the platforms.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
TAUN WE conducts OBI-WAN to the door of Jango Fett's apartment. TAUN WE waves his hand, and a muted bell RINGS.

As they wait, OBI-WAN notes the door lock entry mechanism. Then the door opens, and a ten-year-old boy, BOBA FETT, looks at them. He is identical to the boys in the classroom.

TAUN WE
Boba, is your father here?

There is a brief pause, then BOBA FETT nods.

TAUN WE
(continuing)
May we see him?

BOBA FETT
Sure.

Another brief pause, then BOBA FETT steps aside, and TAUN WE and OBI-WAN go through.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
OBI-WAN, TAUN WE, and BOBA FETT enter the apartment. OBI-WAN looks around the room.

BOBA FETT
Dad! Taun We's here!

JANGO FETT comes in from the bedroom. He wears a jumpsuit. He is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with scars of old wounds. There are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms. He eyes OBI-WAN with suspicion.

TAUN WE
Welcome back, Jango. Was your
trip productive?

JANGO FETT
Fairly.

OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT size each other up. BOBA FETT studies both of them.

TAUN WE
This is Jedi Master, Obi-Wan
Kenobi. He's come to check on our
progress.

JANGO FETT
That right?

JANGO FETT'S eyes fix OBI-WAN coldly.

OBI-WAN
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

JANGO FETT
I'm just a simple man, trying to
make my way in the universe,
Master Jedi.

OBI-WAN
Aren't we all?

OBI-WAN eyes the half-open bedroom door, through which a couple of pieces of body armour can be seen on the floor. JANGO FETT registers OBI-WAN'S look. He moves in front of him, blocking the view.

OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Ever made your way as far into the
interior as Coruscant?

JANGO
Once or twice.

OBI-WAN
Recently?

JANGO
(eyes Obi-Wan carefully)
Possibly...

OBI-WAN
Then you must know Master Sido-
Dyas?

JANGO
Boba, close the door.

BOBA FETT moves to close the bedroom door. JANGO FETT smiles thinly at OBI-WAN.

JANGO
(continuing)
Master who?

OBI-WAN
Sido-Dyas. Isn t he the Jedi who
hired you for this job?

JANGO
Never heard of him. I was
recuited by a man called Darth
Tyranus on one of the moons of
Bogden.

OBI-WAN
No? I thought...

TAUN WE
Sido-Dyas told us to expect him.
And he showed up just when your
Jedi Master said he would. We
have kept the Jedi s involvement
a secret until your arrival, just
as your Master requested.

OBI-WAN
Curious...

JANGO
Do you like your army?

OBI-WAN
It seems to me it's your army -
being that they are all clones of
you.

JANGO
(grinning)
They'll do their job well, I'll
guarantee that.

OBI-WAN
I look forward to seeing them in
action. Thank you for your time,
Jango.

JANGO
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

OBI-WAN and TAUN WE go out. The door slides closed. JANGO FETT turns to his son. He is deep in thought.

BOBA
What is it, Dad?

EXT. SPACE
The Naboo Starship heads toward the desert planet of Tatooine.

EXT. TATOOINE, MOS ESPA STREETS AND WATTO'S SHIP - DAY
The Naboo Starship lands in a large parking lot of Spaceships on the outskirts of Mos Espa. ANAKIN and PADME ride a rickshaw through the streets. ANAKIN stares at sights he hasn't seen for years. Finally, they come  to Wattos' shop, and the rickshaw stops.

ANAKIN
(to the droid driver)
Wait, please.

ANAKIN and PADME get down. Sitting on a stool in front of the shop is WATTO. He is using a small electronic screwdriver on a fiddly DROID. THREE PIT DROIDS are chattering away and are trying to help him, but they seem only to make him madder.

WATTO
(yelling, in Huttese)
No, not that one - that one!

ANAKIN
(arriving)
Excuse me, Watto.

WATTO
(in Huttese)
What?

ANAKIN
(in Huttese)
I said excuse me.

WATTO turns to the chattering PIT DROIDS.

WATTO
(in Huttese)
Shut down.

The PIT DROIDS snap into their storage position.

WATTO
(continuing, in Huttese)
What? I don't know you... What can
I do for you? You look like a
Jedi. Whatever it is... I didn't
do it.

WATTO drops the screwdriver and curses loudly in Huttese

ANAKIN
Let me help you with that.

ANAKIN takes the fiddly piece of equipment and starts to play with it. WATTO blinks in surprise.

ANAKIN
(continuing)
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

WATTO looks at him suspiciously. He stares at PADME, then back to ANAKIN.

WATTO
Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!!

Suddenly, the fiddly piece of equipment in Anakin's hands WHIRS into life. WATTO blinks at it.

WATTO
(continuing; in English)
You are Annie! It is you! You
little womp rat.

WATTO gives ANAKIN a big hug.

WATTO
(continuing)
You sure sprouted Weehoo! A
Jedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybe
you couldda help wit some
daedbeats who owe...

ANAKIN
My mother...

WATTO
Oh, yeah. Shmi... she's not mine
no more. I sold her.

ANAKIN
Sold her...

WATTO
Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but you
know, business is business.
Sold her to a moisture farmer
named Lars. Least I think it was
Lars. Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her. Can
ya beat that?

ANAKIN
Do you know where they are?

WATTO
Long way from here... someplace
over on the other side of Mos
Eisley, I think...

ANAKIN
I'd like to know.

ANAKIN'S grim look means business; WATTO gets the hint quickly.

WATTO
Yeah... sure... absolutely. Let's
go look in my records.

ANAKIN and WATTO go into the shop.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY (RAINSTORM) - DAY
The waves crash against the water city as the storm continues. Light suddenlyt streams from the base of a landing platform as a door slides open.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
OBI-WAN stands with LAMA SU and TAUN WE just inside the open door.

LAMA SU
Tell your Council the first
battalions are ready. And remind
them that if they need more
troops, we will need time to grow
them.

OBI-WAN
I won't forget.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
OBI-WAN comes out from the tower into the driving ran. The door closes behind him. He pulls his robe around him and stands braced against the gale.

Below, a huge wave crashes against the stilts. Spray flies high and whips across the platform where OBI-WAN is standing. He walks over to his Starfighter, looks to see if anyone is watching, then turns and goes back to the door. It slides open.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, CORRIDOR - DAY
OBI-WAN enters cautiously from outside. Ahead, the corridor is deserted. He moves down it.

INT. TIPOCA CITY, FETT APARTMENT - DAY
OBI-WAN walks in to find the room in complete disorder. The bedroom door is wide open - clear signs of hurried departure. All of the Fetts' personal belongings are gone.

OBI-WAN goes to an ultra-thin computer screen. He punches up AN ONSCREEN PICTURE of JANGO FETT and BOBA FETT unhitching the lines securing their ship to the landing platform. JANGO FETT is wearing his armour and rocket pack. BOBA FETT climbs aboard the small Fighter.

EXT. TIPOCA CITY, KAMINO LANDING PLATFORM (RAINSTORM) - DAY
JANGO FETT picks up a case and swings it up to BOBA FETT, who stows it inside the ship. JANGO FETT picks up another case and is about to swing it, when:

BOBA FETT
Dad!!

JANGO FETT turns to see OBI-WAN charging out of the tower toward him. As he runs, OBI-WAN draws his lightsaber from his belt. It flashes on.

JANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBI-WAN deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT.

The bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind him. He fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the Jedi.

JANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow launcher. OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they strike harmlessly against the bounty hunter's armour.

IN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett's ship, BOBA FETT grabs the controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle each other, sizing each other up - feinting.

IN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO FETT blocks his view of OBI-WAN.

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO FETT, who deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty hunter's shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers above OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as:

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires.

OUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects the shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops down, swinging around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the Jedi's hand.

The lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and grabs the lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand.

IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as:

OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching, kicking, grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN grabs JANGO FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air and kicks OBI-WAN loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge. He grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface.

JANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself up. JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform.

OBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBI-WAN charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as he falls over the edge.

Locked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the raging ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing and CRASH onto one of the stilts.

OBI-WAN is knocked clear and drops onto a SMALL SERVICE PLATFORM just above the waves. He hauls himself to his feet. JANGO FETT hovers in mid-air opposite him, as a HUGE WAVE crashes over OBI-WAN. When it subsides, the Jedi has disappeared.

JANGO FETT rockets up to the landing platform, where he drops down beside his ship. He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the pilot's seat. He punches buttons. The engines ROAR.

OUTSIDE, Jango Fett's ship lifts off from the platform and heads up into the lowering sky. It disappears. Lightning flashes. Rain lashes the tower and streams across the surface of the platform, to where:

A HAND suddenlt clutches at the very edge of the platform. A moment later, ANOTHER HAND grabs hold.

EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - LATE DAY
The Naboo Starship descends, hovers, and land on a bluff. ANAKIN and PADME get out. They look down from the edge of the bluff to where the homestead is seen on the desert floor below.

PADME
Stay with the ship, Artoo.

ARTOO WHISTLES as ANAKIN and PADME start down the trail toward the homestead.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
C-3PO is working outside the homestead. He still lacks an outer covering; his inner parts and wiring show. He looks up as ANAKIN and PADME arrive,

C-3PO
Good evening. May I help you?

ANAKIN
Threepio?

C-3PO
Oh, my... oh, my! Master
Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly
believe it! And this must be Miss
Padme.

PADME
Hello, Threepio.

ANAKIN
I've come to see my mother.

C-3PO
Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry,
Master Annie.

PADME
Threepio, what's happened?

C-3PO
I think we'd better go inside.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD - LATE DAY
ANAKIN, PADME and THREEPIO arrive in the courtyard. THREEPIO shuffles ahead.

C-3PO
Master Lars - Master Owen!
Somebody to see you!

OWEN LARS and BERU WHITESUN come out into the courtyard.

ANAKIN
I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm here
looking for my mother.

OWEN
Owen Lars... I guess I'm your
step-brother.
(they shake hands)
This is my girlfriend, Beru.

BERU
Hello.

PADME
I'm Padme.

OWEN
I had a feeling you might show up
some day.

ANAKIN
Is my mother here?

CLIEGG
No, she's not.

CLIEGG LARS swings from the house on a small floating chair. One of his legs is heavily bandaged; the other is missing. He balances awkwardly and puts out a hand.

CLIEGG
(continuing)
Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wife...
Come on inside. We have a lot to
talk about.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, KITCHEN - LATE DAY
BERU puts several steaming cups of ardees on a tray and exits the kitchen...

CLIEGG (O.S.)
It was just before dawn. They
came out of nowhere. A hunting
party of Tusekn Raiders.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, DINING AREA - LATE DAY
CLIEGG, OWEN, PADME and ANAKIN sit around the table, BERU brings the drinks from the kitchen.

CLIEGG
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did, to pick
mushrooms that grow on the
vaporatos. From the tracks, she
was about halfway when they
took her. Those Tuskens walk like
men, but they're vicious, mindless
monsters. Thirty of us went out
after her. Four of us came back.
Three more are still out there
looking. I'd be with them,
only... I just couldn't ride any
more... until I heal.

CLIEGG grimaces, easing his throbbing leg.

CLIEGG
(continuing)
This isn't the way I wanted to
meet you, son. This isn't how
your mother and I planned it. I
don't want to give up on her, but
she's been gone a month. There's
little hope she's lasted this long.

Silence. Then ANAKIN stands up.

OWEN
Where are you going?

ANAKIN
To find my mother.

PADME
No, Annie!

CLIEGG
She's daed, son. Accept it.

ANAKIN
I can feel her pain, and I will
find her. I know she's alive.

ANAKIN turns abruptly.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
ANAKIN stands looking across the desert. PADME comes running out of the homestead after him, followed by OWEN. ANAKIN turns to PADME.

ANAKIN
You are going to have to stay
here. These are good people,
Padme. You'll be safe.

OWEN
Take my speeder bike.

PADME
Anakin...

PADME hugs him. ANAKIN walks over to Owen's speeder bike, which is standing close by.

ANAKIN
I trust you'll watch over her,
Owen.

OWEN
Don't worry.

ANAKIN swings onto the bike. The engine fires.

ANAKIN
I won't be long.

ANAKIN takes off across the desert. PADME watches him go.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
The red planet of Geonosis is circled by a large asteroid field that form rings. Jango Fett's ship appears, heading toward it.

INT. COCKPIT, FETT SHIP, SPACE, GEONOSIS
JANGO FETT grins at BOBA FETT.

JANGO FETT
Nearly there, son.

JANGO FETT guides he ship around the asteroids. Suddenly:

BOBA FETT
Dad, look!!

On the view screen, Obi-Wan's ship appears, chasing after them. JANGO FETT grabs the controls. They are thrown around as the ship plummets to try to lose OBI-WAN.

JANGO FETT
Hang on!

The ship goes into a power-climb. A GREAT SPACE DDOGFIGHT ensues between OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS
The ships flip, roll, and turn at incredible speed, didging, weaving and firing. They tumble from near misses. Hits fly off Obi-Wan's fighter as one of Jango's missiles gets through.

Finally, it seems as if OBI-WAN is getting the upper hand. JANGO FETT breaks off the fight and dives sharply. He maneuvers deftly between two huge asteroids.

In JANGO FETT'S COCKPIT, BOBA FETT flinches as asteroids pass very close by.

BOBA FETT
Dad! Watch out!

JANGO FETT
Stay calm, son. We'll be fine.
That Jedi won't be able to follow
us through this.

But Obi-Wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them.

IN OBI-WAN'S COCKPIT, his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side, avoiding great rocks. Then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path. There seem no way he can avoid it. OBI-WAN fires a couple of aerial torpedoes. They streak toward the asteroid.

IN JANGO'S COCKPIT, they see the huge explosion as Obi-Wan's ship appears to smash into the asteroid.

BOBA FETT
Got him! Yeahhhhh!

JANGO FETT
We won't see him again.

BOBA FETT laughs. Jango Fett's ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of Geonosis.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, JAWA CAMP - SUNSET
ANAKIN stands in the middle of a crowd of JAWAS. He asks them from directions. The JAWAS confer exicitedly, then the CHIEF JAWA points in a particular direction. ANAKIN gets on the bike and speeds off to where the JAWA pointed.

EXT. TATOOINE, DUNE SEA, CAMPFIRE - TWILIGHT
ANAKIN rides over a large dune toward a small flickering light in the distance.

He rides up and stops the bike in front of a campfire. There are bodies of THREE DEAD FARMERS lying beside the campfire. TWO EOPIES are thethered nearby, along with a burned and smoking speeder.

EXT. TATOOINE, LANDSCAPE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
THREE DIFFERENT SHOTS. ANAKIN rids the speeder bike through three exotic landscapes. In one shot, he stops and looks down at some tracks. Then he starts up his speeder and rides off.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
The lights of the vaporators blink in the night sky. Somewhere close by, a night animal HOWLS.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, COURTYARD (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
PADME is pacing the courtyard restlessly. She stops, listening to the animal HOWLING nearby. She shivers slightly, then turns and goes into the garage at the side of the courtyard.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD - GARAGE (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
PADME stands looking at a speeder parked in the garage. Short silence. Then:

C-3PO
Please don't leave us, Miss Padme.
These people need your help.

THREEPIO is parked in a corner.

PADME
I'm not leaving, Threepio. I just
can't sleep.

C-3PO
That's something I cannot relate
to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm
either active or inactive.
There's no in-between.

PADME
I guess you're lucky.

C-3PO
Do you really think so..? I
suppose I shouldn't expect...

PADME
You're not happy here?

C-3PO
Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my
masters here ar so kind I
wouldn't wish to trouuble them,
it's just... being like this...
well, it's embarrassing.

PADME
Being like what?

C-3PO
Naked. If you pardon the
expression. You see, when Master
Annie made me, he never quite
found the time to give me any
outer covering. It's so
humiliating. How would you like it
if you had to go around with all
your circuits showing?

PADME
I guess I wouldn't like it at all.

C-3PO
Of course you wouldn't. Nobody
would. It's simply not protocol.

PADME looks thoughtfully at a pile of spare parts and bits of metal and tools.

PADME
Maybe we can do something about it.

C-3PO
I don't think so. Only Master
Annie...

PADME
Why not? They seem to have a box
of old coverings here.

C-3PO
Oh? How observant of you, Miss
Padme. Of course, I'm just not
mechanically minded... if you see
what I mean.

PADME picks up a piece of metal and holds it against him.

PADME
Let's see, if we put this...
here...

C-3PO
Ooooh! That's tickles.

PADME
You'll have to be quiet, Threepio.
Hold still, please.

EXT. SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
A huge chunk of rock tumbles slowly through the asteroid bely. CAMERA CLOSES, to discover Obi-Wan's Starship hidden in a blasted-out area on the pitted back side of the great rock.

INT. COCKPIT, JEDI FIGHTER, SPACE, GEONOSIS RINGS
OBI-WAN looks out toward Geonosis and sees in the distance a large fleet of Trade Federation Ships hidden among the asteroids. He starts the engines of his fighter.

Obi-Wan's Fighter moves out from the back side of the asteroid and heads away from the asteroid field, descending toward Geonosis.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
Obi-Wan's ship skims across the top of a small mesa along the edge of a rocky ridge. He maneuvers under a rock overhang and lands. He gets out of the Fighter and walks onto the mesa. The wind whips at him. He looks around.

Geonosis is a red rock planet, featureless apart from buttes and mesas, and occasional tall stalagmites that stand out dramatically on the arid plains.

The night is quiet, except for an occasional WEIRD CRY. OBI-WAN checks his bearings, then heads away.

EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
OBI-WAN climbs a steep, narrow trail. Suddenly, a CRY is heard close by. OBI-WAN stumbles slightly. His foot slips on the edge, sending a stream of peblles skittering into the darkness.

OBI-WAN listens. Silence. He draws his lightsaber but does not ignite it.

He sets off again and works his way around a narrow corner, to confront a crouching MASSIFF (a dog-sized lizard) with slavering fangs! The beast leaps at him, and OBI-WAN ignites his lightsaber as the MASSIFF knocks him on his back. Its jaws open wide. OBI-WAN stabs the creature, throws it off of him, and jumps up.

A SECOND MASSIFF jumps from behind. OBI-WAN swings around and cuts it in half. The MASSIFF flies over the cliff, HOWLING. It plummets to its death hundreds of feet below.

EXT. TATOOINE, CLIFF (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
ANAKIN pulls up near the edge of a cliff. He gets off the bike and creeps to the edge. He looks over to see a Tusken camp in the oasis below. One of the huts at the edge of the camp has TWO TUSKEN GUARDS outside it.

EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS (FULL MOON) - NIGHT
ANAKIN creeps through the camp, working his way from hut to hut, flattening himself against the wall,s overhearing snatches of Tusken conversation from inside, using the shadows to him him until he arrives at the hut with the TWO GUARDS. They are sitting a short distance from the door. ANAKIN wriggles around the black. He takes out his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall.

INT. TUSKEN RAIDER HUTT - NIGHT
The lightsaber completes the hole in the wall. ANAKIN wriggles in. He pulls himself to his feet. There are candles everywhere.

A shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the hut. By its light, ANAKIN sees SHMI, hanging from a wooden frame in the middle of the hut.

He cuts her free, takes her into his arms, and lowers her gently to the ground. Her eyes are closed. Her face is bloodied. She has been
terribly beaten. Anakin cradles her tenderly.

ANAKIN
Mom... Mom... Mom...

SHMI'S eyelids flutter - and barely open. They are caked with blood.

SHMI
Annie...? Is it you?

SHMI'S eyes focus slowly. ANAKIN gives a little choking gasp.

ANAKIN
I m here, Mom. You re safe. Hang
on. I m going to get you out of
here...

SHMI
I m so glad... to see you,
Annie... Now... I am complete...

ANAKIN
Just stay with me, Mom. I m going
to make you well again.
Everything s going to be fine.

SHMI
You look so handsome. My son...
my grown-up son. I m so proud of
you, Annie... so proud... I missed
you so much... I love...

SHMI dies. ANAKIN draws her to his breast. There is silence for a moment. ANAKIN lifts his head, listening for a moment, then he sits on the floor of the Tusken hut, cradling his dead mother in his arms.

EXT. GEONOSIS, ROCK FACE TRAIL - NIGHT
OBI-WAN arrives at the head of the trail. Far below, a flat plain stretches into the distance. He stop, peering into the darkness, where strange shapes loom indistinctly.

OBI-WAN takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts them to his eyes. He sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below.

SLOW PAN with the binoculars, and suddenly a line of Battle Starships come into view. OBI-WAN touches the viewfinder. Between fifty and a hundred Federation Starships in near rows. Some are on platforms that are carrying the Starships diwn to an underground facility. Other platforms are rising to the surface. They carry THOUSANDS of BATTLE DROIDS that step off and file into the waiting ships. A fully loaded Starship takes off. OBI-WAN swings the binoculars upward, to see more Federation Starships.

EXT. TATOOINE, TUSKEN RAIDER CAMP, OASIS - DAWN
The pale light grows. Thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold, clear air. Somewhere an dog BARKS. An OLD WOMAN comes out of one of the huts. She carries a pail. She swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground.

As she goes back inside the hut, a TUSKEN CHILD runs past, dragging a stick in the sand. The CHILD runs through the line of huts, turns a corner, and stops suddenly, staring at the bodies of the TWO TUSKEN GUARDS. Between them, ANAKIN stands outside the hut door. His face is a grim mask. The CHILD stares, then there is a FLASH OF LIGHT as Anakin s lightsaber switches on.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA - NIGHT
OBI-WAN comes running back to his ship and climbs into the cockpit. He settles into his seat. His ARFOUR DROID beeps a happy greeting. OBI-WAN switches on his comlink.

OBI-WAN
"Guiding light" to "old folks
home."

EXT. CORUSCANT, REPUBLIC EXECUTIVE BUILDING - DAY
LOW ANGLE. A line of reflecting pools with splashing fountains flanked by statues on each side leads to the main entrance to the awesome building.

INT. CORUSCANT, CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE
A hologram of OBI-WAN flickers in front of a group, made up of Jedi (YODA, MACE WINDU, and KI-ADI-MUNDI) and Senators (BAIL ORGANA, ASK AAK, LUMINARA, and JAR JAR). PALPATINE and MAS AMEDDA are in the middle of the group, watching with growing concern.

OBI-WAN
...Starships from the Trade
Federation and the Commerce Guilds
are taking deliveries of battle
droids from the foundries on
Geonosis.

BAIL ORGANA
That's outrageous! The treaty
forbids the Trade Federation from
building up an army. What are
they doing?!

OBI-WAN
The droid foundry seems to be
working at full capacity. I am
going to go down and investigate.
I will bring Jango Fett back home
for interrogation.

PALPATINE
Those Geonosian foundries are part
of the Techno Union. We will call
in their representatives and ask
them a few very pointed questions.

OBI-WAN
One more thing. Jango mentioned
he was recruited by someone named
Darth Tyranus. Any idea who that
might be?

YODA
With the forename Darth, a Sith he
must be.

MACE WINDU
Our missing apprentice. They are
playing their hand at last.

OBI-WAN
Do you believe he could be the
mysterious Sido-Dyas, who made the
deal for the clone army?

YODA
Perhaps too many pieces are missing
from this puzzle, there are.

MACE WINDU
Be careful, Obi-Wan. This
investigation is becoming less
than routine. Do you need help?

OBI-WAN
Let me see if I can figure out
what's going on first.

The hologram of OBI-WAN fades off. PALPATINE stares at the spot where the hologram was in disbelief.

BAIL ORGANA
The Commerce Guilds are preparing
for war... there can be no doubt
of that.

PALPATINE
Count Dooku must have made a
treaty with them.

MACE WINDU
We must stop them soon before
they're fully ready.

SENATOR ASK AAK
The debate is over, we need
that clone army now!

BAIL ORGANA
Unfortunately, the debate is not
over. The Senate will never be
able to approve the use of that
army before the separatists
attack.

Mas Amedda, who had been silent up until now suddenly speaks up.

MAS AMEDDA
This is a crisis! If the Senate
votes the Chancellor emergency
powers, he could approve the use
of the army in a minute.

PALPATINE
Please, please, I don't wish to
have emergency powers. That's too
extreme a solution. It's akin to
a dictatorship. We must rely on
the Jedi. Master Yoda, how many
are available to go to Geonosis?

MACE WINDU and YODA look at one another.

YODA
Two Hundred,... less or more.

BAIL ORGANA
With all due respect for the Jedi
Order, two hundred will be no
match for hundreds of thousands of
battle droids.

MACE WINDU
Patience. We should wait for Obi-
Wan to report back. We don't know
that Count Dooku has made a treaty
with the Corporate Alliance, it's
speculation.

SENATOR ASK AAK
But we must prepare for the worst.
I'm going to propose a motion
granting emergency powers to the
Chancellor at the next session. We
must not wait!

PALPATINE
Out of the question, Senator! You
and I are too closely aligned.
The issue will become partisan and
debates will begin. The proposal
must come from a neutral source.

MAS AMEDDA
If only Senator Amidala were here.

JAR JAR steps forward from the back of the group.

JAR JAR
Supreme Chancellor... my august
colleagues, I would be proud to
propose the motion in question.
This is a grave situation, and I'm
sure Senator Amidala, and the
Queen of Naboo would agree.

SENATOR ASK AAK
Thank you, Representative Binks.

Silence. Then PALPATINE sighs deeply.

PALPATINE
If called upon, I will serve. But
it will be the saddest day of my
life.

EXT. TATOOINE, DESERT, HOMESTEAD MOISTURE FARM - DAY
All is quiet. BERU comes out of the house. She goes to a moisture line and starts to draw water.

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY
PADME fixes the last piece of covering onto THREEPIO.

PADME
There!

PADME stands back. OWEN is with her. They look at THREEPIO. He isn't the golden figure we know because PADME has had to use whatever stuff she could findin the garage. He is multi-coloured in several textures, but he is complete.

C-3PO
Um. How do I look?

OWEN
Great! You look perfect.

C-3PO
Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm so
happy!
(extending his hand to shake hers)
Oh, pardon me.

THREEPIO drops his hand and bows formally.

THREEPIO
(continuing)
Thank you.

He forgets formality and hugs her. PADME hugs him back, laughing.

C-3PO
(continuing)
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

OWEN
(grinning)
Well, Padme, I think he should be
yours from now on... I know that
is what my Mom would want.

C-3PO
Oh, my!

Then suddenly, from outside:

BERU (V.O.)
Come topside, everybody! He's
back! He's back!

INT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, GARAGE - DAY
A rough hologram of OBI-WAN is projected onto the garage by ARTOO. ANAKIN, PADME and THREEPIO watch the flickering image.

OBI-WAN
...Alliance have pledged their
armies to Count Dooku and are
forming an... Wait!... ah...
attack... I don't... make it...
aaaggghhh!

The hologram cuts off. ANAKIN jumps up, agitated.

ANAKIN
I'm going after him!

PADME
I thought the first thing he said
was to retransmit his message to
Coruscant.

ANAKIN
Yeah, you're right, you're right.

EXT. TATOOINE, HOMESTEAD, MOISTURE FARM - LATE DAY
ANAKIN, PADME, ARTOO and THREEPIO leave the homestead, waving to CLIEGG, OWEN and BERU as they go into the desert.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - SUNSET
ANAKIN sits down in the cockpit with PADME. THREEPIO is behind them. ARTOO is beside him. They are watching a hologram of MACE WINDU.

MACE WINDU
We will deal with Count Dooku. The
most important thing for you,
Anakin, is to stay where you are.
Protect the Senator at all costs.
That is your priority.

ANAKIN
Understood, Master.

The hologram switches off. PADME is looking at the readout on the ship's control panel.

PADME
They'll never get there in time to
save him. They have to come half
way across the galaxy. Look,
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

PADME starts to hit buttons and flick switches. ANAKIN puts a hand over hers, stopping her. She stares at him.

ANAKIN
If he's still alive.

PADME
Annie, are you just going to sit
here and let him die?? He's your
friend... your mentor...

ANAKIN
...He's like my father, but you
heard Master Windu. He gave me
strict orders to stay here.

PADME
He gave you strict orders to
protect me...

PADME pulls her hand free and flicks more switches. The engines fire.

PADME
(continuing)
...and I'm going to save Obi-Wan.
So if you plan to protect me, you
will have to come along.

ANAKIN grins and takes the controls.

EXT. TATOOINE, BLUFF OVERLOOKING HOMESTEAD - SUNSET
The Naboo Starship rises from the bluff and zooms away.

EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - DAY
TWO HUNDRED JEDI KNIGHTS are assembling outside the huge center of the Jedi Order.

INT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY
The JEDI COUNCIL are assembled as MACE WINDU makes his plea.

MACE WINDU
The longer we wait, the stronger
Dooku's armies become. We cannot
wait for the Senate to make up its
mind about granting the Chancellor
emergency powers, in order to be
able to use that clone army... We
have the authority to go now. We
must go now.

All of the JEDI COUNCIL nod their approval.

YODA
Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundred
Jedi send. Enough, let's hope
they are.

INT. CORUSCANT, MAIN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY
Inside the great rotunda, the UPROAR is even louder. Opposing SENATOES yell furiously at one another.

MAS AMEDDA
Order! Order!!

Finally, the uproar dies.

PALPATINE
In the regrettable absence of
Senator Amidala, the chair
recognises Senior
Representative of Naboo, Jar Jar
Binks.

Amid the conflicting storm of CHEERS AND BOOS, JAR JAR, with TWO GUNGAN AIDES, floats on his pod to the middle of the vast space. He looks at PALPATINE nervously. PALPATINE nods. JAR JAR clears his throat.

JAR JAR
Senators, dellow felagates...

Laughter. Jeers. JAR JAR blushes.

MAS AMEDDA
Order! The Senate will accord the
Representative the courtesy of a
hearing!

Comparative quiet. JAR JAR grips the edge of the podium.

JAR JAR
In response to the direct threat
to the Republic from the
Confederacy of Independent
Systems, I propose that the Senate
gives immediate emergency powers to
the Supreme Chancellor.

Uproar. JAR JAR looks a little sheepish.

JAR JAR
(continuing)
Who can deny these are exceptional
times? Exceptional times demand
exceptional measures!
Exceptional measures demand
exceptional men!

ORN FREE TAA
We won't support a dictator.

SHOUTS of agreement.

JAR JAR
That is the sentiment every one of
us agrees with! And when the
shadow of war has dispersed and
the bright day of liberty has
dawned once again, the power we now
give to the Supreme Chancellor
will be gladly, and swiftly
returned. Out ancient liberties
will be restored to us, burnished
even more brightly than before!

Brief silence, then a rolling wave of APPLAUSE. JAR JAR beams and bows.

PALPATINE rises.

PALPATINE
It is with great reluctance that
I have agreed to this calling. I
love democracy... I love the
Republic. The fact that this
crisis is demanding I be given
absolute power to tule over you is
evident. But I am mild by nature
and have no desire to destroy
the democratic process. The power you
give me I will lay down when this
crisis has abated, I promise you.
And all I ask in return is when my
current term of office is over,
you allow me to reture and live
out my life in peace.

MAS AMEDDA
We shall proceed to the vote. All
those in favor of granting
emergency powers to the Supreme
Chancellor, signal ate at this
time... those opposed?

EXT. SPACE
The Naboo Starship heads toward the rings of Geonosis.

EXT. GEONOSIS, LANDING AREA
The Naboo Starship lands.

INT. COCKPIT, NAOO STARFIGHTER - DAY
ANAKIN switches off the engines. ARTOO and THREEPIO are in the navigation area of the cockpit. PADME is in the co-pilot's seat. She gets up.

ANAKIN
Hey, where are you going?

PADME
To find Obi-Wan.

ANAKIN gets up and goes over to her.

ANAKIN
No! You're not!

He grabs her arm.

PADME
Let go of me!

ANAKIN
I'm not letting you go out there.
It's too dangerous.

PADM 
What?!?

ANAKIN
It's my job to protect you. I said
it's too dangerous. You're not
going, and that's final!

PADM 
Don't you give me orders, Annie!
I'm a Senator of the Galactic
Republic. You have no authority
to contain me, restrain me, or
direct me! You remember your
place, young man.
(standing up)
Now you can come along and protect
me or stay here. It's up to you.

PADME storms out of the cockpit of the Naboo Starfighter. ANAKIN stands scratching his head, then follows.

ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.

C-3PO
Yes, it is, Artoo. Most
confusing. One moment they're
generating a pleasant mutual
attraction and the next, waves of
violent hostility. Even though
I'm programmed to understand them,
I doubt if I ever shall.

ARTOO WHISTLES a plaintive sigh.

INT. GEONOSIS, CORRIDORS - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME enter the stalagmite city. They stop, looking around in wonder at the emptiness.

PADME
(in a low voice)
It's empty!

They start forward. As they pass, the surface of the pillars seems to pulse slowly and move. High above WINGED CREATURES grow from the pillars and detach themselves.

INT. GEONOSIS, CENTRAL SQUARE - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME cross the square, reaching the middle. They stop suddenly as FOUR GEONOSIANS grabs them. ANAKIN reaches for his lightsaber.

PADME
Wait!

TWENTY WINGED GEONOSIANS carrying weapons alight on the flagstones in front of them.

The GEONOSIANS part, and COUNT DOOKU appears. He bows courteously.

COUNT DOOKU
Senator Amidala, I've heard so
much about you.

PADM 
Count Dooku, I assume.

COUNT DOOKU
I'm delighted to meet you at
last. We have a great deal to
discuss, Senator. I hope you can
keep your young Jedi under control.

PADM 
Don't worry he's housebroken.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM (GEONOSIS) - DAY
COUNT DOOKU sits at a large conference table with PADME on the far
side. ANAKIN stands behind her with FOUR GEONOSIANS GUARDS standing behind him. JANGO FETT stands behind COUNT DOOKU, and SIX GEONOSIAN GUARDS stand behind him.

PADM 
You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi-
Wan Kenobi. I am formally
requesting you turn him over to
me, now.

DOOKU
He has been convicted of
espionage, Senator, and will be
executed. In just a few hours, I
believe.

COUNT DOOKU smiles.

PADM 
He is an officer of the Republic.
You can't do that.

DOOKU
We don't recognise the Republic
here, Senator. But if Naboo were
to join our Alliance, I could
easily hear your plea for clemency.

ANAKIN grabs his lightsaber but doesn't turn it on.

PADM 
And if I don't join your
rebellion, I assume this Jedi with
me will also die?

DOOKU
I don't wish to make you to join
our cause against your will,
Senator, but you are a rational,
honest representative of your
people and I assume you want to do
what's in their best interest.
Aren't you fed up with the
corruption, the bureaucrats, the
hypocrisy of it all?.. Aren't
you? Be honest, Senator.

PADM 
The ideals are still alive, Count,
even if the institution is failing.

DOOKU
You believe in the same ideals we
believe in! The same ideals we
are striving to make prominent.

PADM 
If what you say is true, you
should stay in the Republic and
help Chancellor Palpatine put
things right.

DOOKU
The Chancellor means well, M'Lady
but he is incompetent. He has
promised to cut the bureaucracy,
but the bureaucrats are stronger
than ever, no? Senator, the
Republic cannot be fixed. It is
time to start over. The
democratic process in the Republic
is a sham, a shell game played
on the voters. It will not be long
before the cult of greed, called
the Republic, will lose even the
pretext of democracy and freedom.

PADM 
I cannot believe that. I will not
forsake all I have honoured and
worked for and betray the
Republic. I know of your treaties
with the Trade Federation, the
Commerce Guilds, and the others,
Count. What is happening here is
not government that has been
bought out by business... it's
business becoming government!

DOOKU
Are you willing to betray your Jedi
friends? Without your co-operation
I can do nothing to stop their
execution.

PADM 
What is to happen to me? Am I to be
executed also?

DOOKU
I wouldn't think of such an
offence. But, there are
individuals who have a strong
interest in your demise, M'lady.
It has nothing to do with
politics, I'm afraid. It's purely
personal, and they have already
paid great sums to have you
assassinated. I'm sure they will
push hard to have you included in
the executions. I'm sorry but if
you are not going to co-operate, I
must turn you over to the
Geonosians for justice. I've done
all I can for you.

JANGO FETT moves over to ANAKIN.

JANGO FETT
I'll take that weapon.

ANAKIN hesitates.

DOOKU
You may cause a lot of bloodshed,
my young Jedi, but you will not
escape.

PADM 
Anakin...

ANAKIN hands his lightsaber over to JANGO FETT.

INT. GEONOSIS, HIGH AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY
ANAKIN and PADME are standing in the centre of what looks like a courtroom. Seated before them in a tall, boxed-off area is POGGLE THE LESSER, Archduke of Geonosis. He is accompanied by his underling, SUN RIT. Off to one side the Separatist Senators PO NUDU, TESSEK, and TOONBUCK TOORA. Next to them are the Commerce Dignitaries, SHU MAI, NUTE GUNRAY, PASSEL ARGENTE, WAT TAMBOR and SAN HILL of the Intergalactic Bank Clan. Along the wall about a HUNDRED GEONOSIANS wait for a verdict.

SUN RIT
You have been charged and found
guilty of Espionage.

POGGLE
Do you have anything to say before
your sentence is carried out?

PADM 
You are committing an act of war,
Archduke. I hope you are prepared
for the consequences.

POGGLE laughs. COUNT DOOKU simply smiles.

POGGLE
We build weapons, Senator... that
is our business! Of course we're
prepared!

NUTE GUNRAY
Get on with it. Carry out the
sentence. I want to see her suffer.

POGGLE
Your other Jedi friend is waiting
for you, Senator. Take them to
the arena!

FOUR GUARDS take hold of PADME and ANAKIN. They are escorted out of the chamber to the sounds of chuckling.

INT. GEONOSIS TUNNEL TO EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
In the gloomy tunnel, ANAKIN and PADME are tossed into an open cart. The murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen. GUARDS extend their arms along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each other.

The DRIVER gets up onto his seat.

ANAKIN
Don't be afraid.

PADM 
I'm not afraid to die. I've been
dying a little bit each day since
you came back into my life.

ANAKIN
What are you talking about?

PADM 
I love you.

ANAKIN
You love me?! I thought we
decided not to fall in love. That
we would be forced to live a lie.
That it would destroy our lives...

PADM 
I think our lives are about to be
destroyed anyway. My love for you
is a puzzle, Annie, for which I
have no answers. I can't control
it... and now I don't care. I
truly, deeply love you, and before
we die I want you to know.

PADME leans toward ANAKIN. By straining hard, it is just possible for
their lips to meet. They kiss.

ANAKIN
I have no desire to be cured of
this love either. Long or short,
I vow to spend the rest of my life
with you.

They kiss again.

The DRIVER cracks his whip over the ORRAY harnessed between the shafts. The cart jerks forward. Suddenly, there isa HUGE ROAR and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena

INT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
The great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling GEONOSIANS. The cart trundles to the center, where OBI-WAN is chained to one of four upright posts thatare three feet in diameter. The cart stops. PADME and ANAKIN are taken down, dragged to posts, and chained to them. PADME is in the center.

OBI-WAN
I was beginning to wonder if you
had gotten my message.

ANAKIN
I retransmitted it as you
requested, Master. Then we decided
to come and rescue you.

OBI-WAN
It looks like you're going a good
job so far.

Their arms are pulled high above their heads, and the cart drives away. There is another ROAR as POGGLE THE LESSER, COUNT DOOKU, NUTE GUNRAY, THE FETTS and DIGNITARIES arrive in the archducal box and take their places.

SUN RIT
The felons before you have been
convicted of espionage against the
Sovereign System of Geonosis.
Their sentence of death is to be
carried out in this public arena
henceforth.

The crowd ROARS and CHEERS. In the box, POGGLE THE LESSER rises. The crowd becomes quiet.

POGGLE
Let the executions begin!

The crowd goes wild.

ANAKIN
I have a bad feeling about this.

From different gates around the arena, THREE MONSTERS are driven in. One is a REEK (bull-like), one is a NEXU (lion-like), and one is an ACKLAY (a kind of dino-lobster). They are driven in by PICADORS carrying long spears and riding ORRAYS. The PICADORS poke the MONSTERS toward the center, then retire to the perimeter.

The MONSTERS toss their heads, looking around, ROARING or SCREECHING. Then they catch sight of the THREE CAPTIVES and start moving toward them.

OBI-WAN
Take the one the left. I'll
take the one on the right.

ANAKIN
What about Padme?

PADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.

OBI-WAN
It looks like she's already on top
of things.

The REEK charges ANAKIN. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. ANAKIN lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post

OBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling. The ACKLAY crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-WAN leaps up and runs towards ONE of the PICADORS. The ACKLAY taks off after him.

The NEXU arrives at PADME'S post and rears on its hind legs. One top, PADME struggles to tear the chain free. The NEXU ROARS, displaying wicked, dripping fangs.

In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY beams and rubs his hands.

In the arena, OBI-WAN runs at the PICADOR. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-WAN grabs the PICADOR'S long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing ACKLAY smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The PICADOR tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the ACKLAY and crunched.

ANAKIN's REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.

The NEXU's claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.

In the archducal box:

NUTE GUNRAY
Foul!! She can't do that... shoot
her or something!

In the arena, OBI-WAN runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the ACKLAY, hitting it in the neck. It lets out a terrible SCREECH and turns on him. The NEXU springs up and makes to leap up at PADME again. She finally manages to work the chain loose. ANAKIN comes charging up on the REEK.

ANAKIN
You okay?

PADME
(nods, gasping)
Sure! Well, sort of.

ANAKIN
Jump!!!

The NEXU springs. PADME leaps from the top of the post to land on the REEK in front of ANAKIN. He hauls her upright. The REEK charges away, around the arena. The NEXU bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded ACKLAY. The NEXU smells the blood and turns aside to attack the ACKLAY. The TWO MONSTERS fight. The crowd GROANS and BOOS.

In the archducal box, NUTE GUNRAY turns angrily to COUNT DOOKU.

NUTE GUNRAY
This isn't how it's supposed to
be! Jango, finish her off.

COUNT DOOKU motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put. BOBA FETT is enjoying the spectacle.

COUNT DOOKU
(smiling enigmatically)
Patiece, Viceroy... she will die.
Maybe this is the way it's
supposed to end.

OBI-WAN runs and jumps on the back of the REEK behind ANAKIN. Across the arena, the NEXU, having chewed up the ACKLAY, starts to advance toward them.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
ARTOO BEEPS

C-3PO
Yes, it has been rather a long
time. Do you suppose something's
happened to them?

ARTOO BEEPS and WHISTLES.

C-3PO
(continuing)
Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't think
so. It looks a very dull planet
to me. They should be back
shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo.

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
In the archducal box, amid the uproar, COUNT DOOKU feels a tap on his shoulder. He turns to see MACE WINDU standing behind him. COUNT DOOKU masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees JEDI KNIGHTS standing at every entrance and exit.

COUNT DOOKU
Master Windu, how pleasant of you
to join us. You're just in time
for the moment of truth. I would
think these two new boys of yours
could use a little more training.

MACE WINDU
Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku.
This party's over.

MACE WINDU signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about ONE HUNDRED JEDI switch on their lightsabers. The crowd is suddenly silent. COUNT DOOKU'S lips curl in slight amusement.

COUNT DOOKU
(to Mace Windu)
Brave, but stupid, my old Jedi
friend. You're impossibly
outnumbered.

MACE WINDU
I don't think so. One Jedi has to
be worth a hundred Geonosians.

COUNT DOOKU looks around the great theater. His smile grows.

COUNT DOOKU
It wasn't the Geonosians I was
thinking about. How well do you
think one Jedi will hold up
against a thousand battle droids?

COUNT DOOKU signals. THOUSANDS OF DROIDS start to pour into all parts of the arena.

MACE WINDU draws his lightsaber, JANGO FETT draws his guns and fires at MACE WINDU, who deflects the shots. JANGO FETT and MACE WINDU jump into the arena, where they fight. BOBA FETT wacthes his Dad and the Jedi Master fight. The battle beginss. GEONOSIANS fly away everywhere. DROIDS fire at JEDI, who deflect the bolts and cult down the DROIDS. The GEONOSIAN TROOPS fire ray guns that are more difficult for the JEDI to deflect.

The REEK and the NEXU are spooked by the battle. The REEK bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling DROIDS and JEDI that have moved into its path. PADME picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. SEVERAL JEDI run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN.

Among the crowd, JEDI cut down swaths of GEONOSIANS and DROIDS. On the sand, JEDI fight, attacking DROIDS. OBI0WAN and ANAKIN swing their lightsabers, cutting DROIDS in half. PADME blasts away at DROIDS and GEONOSIANS.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP
ARTOO whistles.

C-3PO
I don't hear anything.
(Artoo beeps)
You're scaring me! Stop imagining
things!

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
Among the tiers, JEDI are slowly being driven back. They have killed heaps of GEONOSIANS and have kncoked out piles of DROIDS, but sheer numbers are telling. Individual JEDI are being cut down or blasted  The rest are retreating into the arena.

ANAKIN and PADME are back-to-back, fighting DROIDS and flying GEONOSIANS. MACE WINDU fights fiercely with JANGO FETT. Finally, the bounty hunter falls. His helmet goes flying, bouncing down the steps, tumbling and rolling, kicked here and there by random feet. The bounty hunter's body falls to the ground.

MACE WINDU runs to the center of the arena and fights back-to-back with OBI-WAN, as they swipe and mangle DROIDS.

OBI-WAN
Someone's got to - shut down -
these droids.

MACE WINDU
Don't worry! It's being - taken
care of!

EXT. GEONOSIS, FEDERATION STARSHIP - DAY
KI-ADI-MUNDI leads a raiding party of about TWENTY JEDI through the lines of parked Battle Starships. They cut a swath through masses of DROIDS until they arrive at the Command Starship. Some JEDI fall. The rest cut their way up the ramps and into the Command Ship.

INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CORRIDORS - DAY
KI-ADI-MUNDI and teh surviving JEDI fight their way through the corridors of the Command Ship, deflecting laser bolts, slicing DROIDS.

INT. COMMAND FEDERATION STARSHIP, CONTROL BRIDGE - DAY
THEY burst onto the bridge and chop down the COMMAND DROIDS. The NEIMOIDIANS flee in all directions. KE-ADI-MUNDI leans over the control panel. He locates the illuminated master switch and punches down on it. It goes dark. Instantly, all the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena FREEZE!

There is a moment of stunned silence, then the JEDI CHEER. One the bridge, PLO KOON claps KI-ADI-MUNDI on the back.

PLO KOON
We've done it! Now we have a
chance!

Suddenly, there is a harsh BEEPING SOUND. All the DROIDS on the Starship and all the DROIDS in the arena start fighting again! KI-ADI-MUNDI stares in disbelief and dismay.

KI-ADI-MUNDI
The system's off but they're still
active. That's a new feature. They
are independent of the control
system.

EXT. GEONOSIS, EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
MACE WINDU, OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, PADME and an exhausted group of about TWENTY JEDI stand in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of BATTLE DROIDS. The bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of DEAD GEONOSIANS, SHATTERED DROIDS and JEDI.

At the foot of some steps, BOBA FETT finds his father's battered helmet. He picks it up.

KI-ADI-MUNDI and the SURVIVORS from the raiding party are herded into the arena by SUPERDROIDS. From the encircling tiers above, THOUSANDS OF BATTLE DROIDS level their weapons menacingly.

In the archducal box, COUNT DOOKU lifts his hand. The DROIDS lower their weapons. The COUNT calls out to the JEDI.

COUNT DOOKU
Master Windu!

Silence.

COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)
You have fought gallantly. Worthy
of recognition in the history
archives of the Jedi Order. Now
it is finished.
(pauses briefly)
Surrender - and your lives will be
spared.

MACE WINDU
We will not be hostages for you to
barter with Dooku.

COUNT DOOKU
Then, I'm sorry, old friend. You
will have to be destroyed.

The DROIDS raise their weapons. ANAKIN and PADME clasps hands tightly. COUNT DOOKU raises his hand to give the order to fire. PADME looks up suddenlt and whispers to ANAKIN.

PADME
Look!

Above, six Gunships are descending fast through the open area in the arena ceiling. They land in a cluster around the handful of JEDI. CLONE TROOPERS spill out and start firing at the DROIDS. There is a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by the Gunships. YODA appears at the door of one of the Gunships.

YODA
Come on - hurry! Hurry!

The SURVIVING JEDI dash to the Gunships and scramble in. MACE WINDU hangs on tight as the Gunship, firing all its weapons, rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim.

EXT. GEONOSIS, TERRAIN OUTSIDE EXECUTION ARENA - DAY
The massed lines of parked Federation Starships and the DROIDS surrounding the arena, are themselves surrounded by thousands of Republic Starships, disgorging TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. Beyond, more Republic Starships are landing and spewing out troops.

INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER ONE - DAY
MACE WINDU stares at the incredible sight.

YODA
More battalions to the left.
Encircle them we must, then
divide.

The CLONE TROOPERS open fire with artillery. EXPLOSIONS wreck the parked Battle Starships. CLONE TROOPERS advance, firing at the massed DROIDS. FIGHTER DROIDS fly overhead, exchanging fire with the Gunships and JEDI fighters.

INT. COCKPIT, NABOO STARSHIP - DAY
THREEPIO and ARTOO see flashes outside of the ship, exploding everywhere.

C-3PO
I'm sure I heard something, this
time. Didn't you? It's probably
just a celebration

ARTOO lets out an EXHAUSTED BLEEP.

EXT. BATTLEFIELD, GEONOSIS LANDSCAPE - DAY
Gunship  2 skims the battlefield, firing down, deflecting answering fire from the droids.

INT. GUNSHIP NUMBER TWO - DAY
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PADME are at the open sides of the Gunship. CLONES fire down at the DROIDS below.

The Gunship slows, circling over a droid gun-emplacement. It blasts it, but suddenly the Gunship is rocked by a near miss. It lurches violently.

OBI-WAN
Hold on! Look over there...

Through the other side of the Gunship, they see a Geonosian Speeder racing past. In the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of COUNT DOOKU.

ANAKIN
It's Dooku, go after him!

The PILOT starts to comply, but... there is a HUGE BLASTS, the ship lurches on its side, and PADME tumbles out.

ANAKIN
(continuing)
Padme!!!

ANAKIN stares down in horror as PADME hits thr ground below.

ANAKIN
(continuing; to pilot)
Put the ship down! Down!

OBI-WAN
No! Forget her. We have to go
after Dooku.

ANAKIN
No we're not!! Land this ship!

OBI-WAN
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way. We've got a job to
do.

Below, PADME hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go after DOOKU.

ANAKIN
I don't care!.. Go back.

OBI-WAN
Anakin! She's all right! Look.

ANAKIN stares out to see PADME rescued by CLONE TROOPERS.

OBI-WAN
(continuing)
Follow that speeder!

On the ground, PADME looks up at Gunship  2 as it speeds away after Count Dooku. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN follow the speeder to a Geonosian tower. The speeder decsends rapidly; the Gunship follows.

Count Dooku's speeder parks outside the tower; the Gunship parks next to it. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN leap down and run inside the tower.

INT. GEONOSIS, SECRET HANGER TOWER - LATE DAY
COUNT DOOKU throws switches on a control panel. His Interstellar Sail Ship is guarded by a SQUAD OF SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The doors of the exit-port slide open.

DROID CAPTAIN
Your Excellency!

COUNT DOOKU turns as OBI-WAN and ANAKIN run in through the hanger doors. They draw their lightsabers. The DROIDS raise their weapons.

COUNT DOOKU
That won't be necessary, Captain.
Stand down. And leave them to me.

The DROIDS lower their weapons and back off to the walls. COUNT DOOKU looks at OBI-WAN and ANAKIN with slight amusement.

OBI-WAN
(to Anakin)
We move in together - you slowly
on the...

ANAKIN
I'm taking him now!

OBI-WAN
Anakin, no!

ANAKIN
You'll pay for all the Jedi you've
killed today, Dooku.

ANAKIN charges across the open space at COUNT DOOKU, who smiles faintly, watching him come. ANAKIN raises his lightsaber. At the last moment, COUNT DOOKU thrusts out an arm, and ANAKIN is lifted up, hurled across the room, and slammed into the opposite wall. He slumps to the foot of the wall, semi-conscious. COUNT DOOKU moves toward OBI-WAN

COUNT DOOKU
Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see,
my Jedi powers are far beyond
yours. Now, back down.

OBI-WAN
I don't think so.

OBI-WAN lifts his lightsaber. COUNT DOOKU smiles.

COUNT DOOKU
Ah, but if I must.

COUNT DOOKU draws his lightsaber. He and OBI-WAN start to circle each other.

COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)
I have spent the last ten years
learning to use the power of the
Dark Side. It gives me infinitely
greater power.

OBI-WAN
You will have to prove it.

OBI-WAN comes in fast, swinging at COUNT DOOKU'S head. DOOKU parries the cut easily. As they fight, it quickly becomes clear that DOOKU is the complete swordsman - elegant, graceful, classical - a master of the old style.

COUNT DOOKU
Grand Master Kenobi, you
disappoint me. Yoda holds you in
such high esteem.

COUNT DOOKU parried another cut.

COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)
Surely you can do better...?
(parries)
No, I'm surprised. Has Jedi
swordsmanship degenerated so
quickly, or are you trying to make
fun of me?
(cuts)
Which is it?

COUNT DOOKU thrusts. OBI-WAN steps back quickly, panting for breath.

COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)
come, come, Master Kenobi. Put me
out of my misery.

OBI-WAN takes a deep breath, gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again. For a moment, he drives COUNT DOOKU back. Then Dooku's superior skill begins to tell again, and he forces OBI-WAN to retreat.

COUNT DOOKU increases the tempo of his attack. OBI-WAN is pushed to the limit to defend himself. DOOKU presses. His lightsaber flashes.

OBI-WAN is wounded in the shoulder, then the thigh. He stumbles back against the wall, trips, and falls. His lightsaber goes skittering across the floor.

COUNT DOOKU raises his lightsaber. OBI-WAN looks up helplessly. Dooku's lightsaber flashes down and CLASHES against - Anakin's lightsaber! COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN stare eyeball to eyeball.

COUNT DOOKU
(continuing)
That's brave of you, boy - but
foolish. I would have thought
you'd have learnt your lesson.

ANAKIN
I'm a slow learner.

And ANAKIN charges at COUNT DOOKU. The force of his attack catches the Count slightly off balance. Anakin's lightsaber flashes. COUNT DOOKU draws back, putting a hand to his arm. He takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee Anakin has nicked him.

COUNT DOOKU
You have unusual powers, young
Padawan. But not enought to save
you this time.

ANAKIN
Don't bet on it!

OBI-WAN
Anakin!

OBI-WAN uses the Force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to ANAKIN. With TWO LIGHTSABERS, ANAKIN attacks. COUNT DOOKU parries and ripostes. It is no contest. ANAKIN is driven back against the wall. He loses one lightsaber. Finally COUNT DOOKU, in one flashing move, sends Anakin's arm, cut at the elbow, flying still gripping his lightsaber. ANAKIN drops to the ground in agony. COUNT DOOKU draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace.

Suddenly, the great doors slide open. The DROIDS turn fast, raising their weapons. Through the thick smoke, emerges the heroic figure of YODA. He stops on the smoke-filled threashold, FOUR DROIDS lined up on either side of him, guns pointed.

Before the DROIDS can get off a shot, YODA raises his hand, and the DROIDS are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking metal.

Silence. COUNT DOOKU steps away from ANAKIN to face the Jedi Grand Master. His lightsaber whirls in a formal salute.

COUNT DOOKU
Master Yoda. At last we shall
know who is the most powerful.

YODA draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane. He salutes formally.

YODA
Count Dooku. No interest in
contests, do I have.

COUNT DOOKU charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that Dooku aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower.

YODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT DOOKU is forced to retreat. Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of Yoda's speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light.

Count Dooku's lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel. YODA jumps onto DOOKU'S shoulders, and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the Count's head.

YODA
(continuing)
The end for you, Count, this is.

COUNT DOOKU
...Not yet...

COUNT DOOKU raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the Force to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger. It comes crashing down on OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. But in the blink of and eye, YODA is under the crane, holding it up, using the Force. YODA closes his eyes and concentrates.

ANAKIN is unconscious, and OBI0WAN tries toget out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.

YODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE ENGINES increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of ANAKIN and is thrown to the ground. DOOKU'S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away. PADM  and a CLONE CAPTAIN with about TEN TROOPERS appear in the doorway.

PADM 
Anakin!

PADM  runs too him and throws her arms around him. ANAKIN is barely able to stand up. The CLONE CAPTAIN marches up to YODA, stops, and salutes smartly.

CLONE CAPTAIN
Resistance is at an end, General.
What are your orders ?

YODA looks at him and sighs.

EXT. CORUSCANT, OLD TOWN - DAWN
COUNT DOOKU'S Interstellar Sail Ship glides through a deserted, burned-out part of Coruscant. COUNT DOOKU manoeuvres the ship into one of the empty buildings and lands.

INT. CORUSCANT, SECRET LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN
The ramp lowers. COUNT DOOKU emerges and walks to where the hooded figure of DARTH SIDIOUS stands waiting. COUNT DOOKU bows.

COUNT DOOKU
The Force is with us, my Master.

DARTH SIDIOUS
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You have
done well.

COUNT DOOKU
I bring you good news, my Lord.
The war has begun.

DARTH SIDIOUS
Excellent.
(smiling)
Everything is going as planned.

EXT. CORUSCANT, JEDI TEMPLE - SUNSET
The beautiful temple basks in the red glow of the setting sun.

INT. JEDI TEMPLE, COUNCIL CHAMBER - SUNSET

MACE WINDU
Where is your apprentice?

OBI-WAN
On his way back to Naboo. He is
escorting Senator Amidala home.

They are standing, looking out through the tall windows at the great plaza below. YODA sits in his chair.

OBI-WAN
(continuing)
I must admit without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

YODA
Victory? Victory, you say?

OBI-WAN turns and looks at the sad little Jedi sitting in the Council Chamber. Apart from KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON, who is wounded, the Chamber is empty.

YODA
(continuing)
Not victory, a defeat, it was...
Master Obi-Wan. Begun, the Clone
War has!

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN - LATE DAY
In a rose-covered arbor overlooking the sparkling late, ANAKIN and PADME stand before a NABOO HOLY MAN.

THREEPIO and ARTOO stand by, watching, as the HOLY MAN blesses the happy couple and, amid gently falling rose petals, ANAKIN and PADME kiss.

EXT. CORUSCANT, MILITARY STAGING AREA, BALCONY - LATE DAY
PALPATINE, JAR JAR, BAIL ORGANA and the OTHER SENATORS, with TWO ROYAL GUARDS, stand looking down at the square below.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS are drawn up in a strict formation or move forwards in near files to climb the ramps of the Military Assault Ships.

On the balcony, PALPATINE'S expression is deeply sad. Everyone watches comberly as, in the square, loaded Assault Ships take off. Other land immediately in their place. The sky above is thick with transports. CLONE TROOPS march and board the Ships.

The Great Clone War has begun...

SAAVIK
Visual!

On screen we see the approach  of the Klingon vessels,
they are dark and sinister.

SAAVIK
(continuing)
Battle stations! Activate shields!

The ALARM SOUNDS.

SULU
Shields activated!

SAAVIK
Inform the Klingons we are on a
rescue mission...

UHURA
They're jamming all frequencies,
Captain --

COMPUTER VOICE
Klingons on attack course and closing.

Screen verifies this. Saavik makes an agonized choice.

SAAVIK
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu,
get us out of here.

SULU
I'll try, Captain.

COMPUTER VOICE
Klingon cruisers approaching,
bearing 090, mark 20.

SAAVIK
Visual!

The image flops: more Klingons approach. They FIRE
photon torpedoes.

SAAVIK
(continuing)
Evasive action!

Sulu does his best, but Enterprise is hit; Sulu is
hurled from his station, and Bones hurries to him.

SAAVIK
(continuing)
Engineering! damage report!

SCOTTY'S VOICE
(INTERCOM)
Main energizer hit, Captain!

SAAVIK
Engage auxiliary power. Prepare
to return fire!

The bridge takes another hit -- a big one. In its wake
there is a second electrical EXPLOSION along the communi-
cations panel. Uhura falls from her station. Bones
rushes to her side amid the smoke and alarms.

A CADET
Shields collapsing, Captain!

SCOTTY'S VOICE
(FILTERED)
Captain, we're losing auxiliary
power!

SAAVIK
Fire all phasers...!

SPOCK
No power to the weapons system,
sir.

Another hit: reverberating flashes of spark and flame
on the bridge. Spock dies. Bones comes to him, but
even as he coughs his way through the smoke, a final
hit and Bones falls. The room is smoke filled and a
shambles. Saavik looks about in shock.

SCOTTY'S VOICE
(FILTERED)
Captain, it's no use. We're
dead in space.

Saavik digests this for a painful moment. Then, touch-
ing a comm button:

SAAVIK
Activate escape pods. Send out the
Log Buoy... All hands abandon ship.
Repeat -- all hands --

KIRK'S VOICE
(FILTERED)
All right, open her up.

There is a loud CLANGING and  --

4   FULL SHOT - ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                4

The side walls of the "bridge" slide apart, revealing
a lighted room beyond. Through the opening strides
KIRK. He stops, surveys the shambles, and shakes his
head.

SAAVIK
Any suggestions, Admiral?

KIRK
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons
do not take prisoners.
(to Spock)
Captain.

SPOCK
Trainees to the briefing room.

Sulu awakens with a grin. Uhura straightens herself
demurely. The Trainees head toward the distant room,
Spock rises and leaves. Bones remains on the floor,
head propped in his hand, whimsically.

KIRK
Physician, heal thyself.

BONES
That's all you have to say?

KIRK
I'm not a drama critic.

Bones rolls his eyes and rises. Kirk sees Saavik who
has not moved.

KIRK
(continuing)
Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going
to stay with the sinking ship?

SAAVIK
Permission to speak candidly, sir?

KIRK
Very well.

SAAVIK
(fights emotion)
I don't believe this was a fair
test of my command capabilities.

KIRK
And why not?

SAAVIK
Because... there was no way to win.

KIRK
A no-win situation is a possibility
every commander may face. Has that
never occurred to you?

SAAVIK
... No, sir. It has not.

KIRK
How we deal with death is at least
as important as how we deal with
life, wouldn't you say?

SAAVIK
(falters)
As I indicated, Admiral, that
thought had not occurred to me.

KIRK
Then you have something new to think
about. Carry on.

She stays at attention.

BONES
Wouldn't it be easier to put
an experienced crew back on the
ship?

KIRK
They'll learn. Galloping about the
cosmos is a game for the young,
doctor.

He leaves. They look at each other.

UHURA
(offended)
What is that supposed to mean?

HOLD ON Saavik.

5   INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE SIMULATOR ROOM - DAY               5

Kirk rounds the corner and sees Spock, leaning against
the wall.

KIRK
(dry)
Aren't you dead?

Spock almost smiles.

KIRK
(continuing)
I assume you are loitering here
to learn what efficiency rating
I plan to give your cadets.

SPOCK
I am understandably curious.

They walk together.

KIRK
They destroyed the simulator room
and you with it.

SPOCK
The Kobayshi Maru scenario
frequently wreaks havoc with
students and equipment.
(dry)
As I recall you took the test
three times yourself. Your final
solution was, shall we say, unique?

KIRK
(solemn)
It had the virtue of never having
been tried.

SPOCK
Yours was not a solution which
would have occurred to a Vulcan
mentality.

KIRK
So you said at the time. Speaking
of which, your prot g 's first
rare -- a trifle emotional --

SPOCK
She's half Romulan, Jim. The
admixture makes her more volatile
than -- me, for example.

KIRK
Than you. Yes, I see that. By
the way, thank you for this.

He lifts the book.

SPOCK
I know of your fondness for antiques.

KIRK
(reads)
'It was the best of times, it was
the worst of times...' Message,
Spock?

SPOCK
None of which I am consciously
aware -- except, of course, happy
birthday -- surely the best of times.

Kirk looks around uncomfortably, overlaps:

KIRK
Hrummm... and where are you off
to, now?

SPOCK
The Enterprise. I must check in
before your inspection. And you?

KIRK
(shortly)
Home.

Spock studies him --

SPOCK
Something oppresses you.

They are old friends --

KIRK
Something.

He steps into a turbo elevator. The doors close as
Spock watches, wiping the scene.

6   EXT. DEEP SPACE - NEAR CETI ALPHA V                          6

In f.g. is the U.S.S. RELIANT, an older, somewhat
battered starship of the ENTERPRISE class, with a
slightly different configuration. Reliant approaches
an inhospitable-looking yellow planet: CETI ALPHA V

CHEKOV'S VOICE
Starship log, Stardate 8130.4.
This report classified MOST SECRET.
Log Entry by Commander Pavel Chekov,
Duty Officer. Starship USS Reliant
on orbital approach with Ceti Alpha
VI in connection with project code
name GENESIS. We are continuing
our search for a lifeless planet
which will serve as a suitable test
site for the Genesis Experiments.
This is the 16th planet we have
visited, so far, no success.

7   INT. BRIDGE OF RELIANT                                       7

Well-aged and distinctive. The usual compliment of
officers and crew. CAPTAIN CLARK TERRELL, about 45,
soft spoken and in good shape, but somewhat laconic.

Behind Terrell, surveying the data screen is COMMANDER
CHEKOV, aged some, but still boyish.

TERRELL
Standard orbit, Mr. Beach.

BEACH
Standard orbit, sir.

TERRELL
Any change in surface scan?

BEACH
Negative. Limited atmosphere,
dominated by craylon gas, sand and
high velocity winds. Incapable
of supporting life forms.

Forward screen: Ceti Alpha.

CHEKOV
Does it have to be completely
lifeless?

Terrell rises and crosses to Chekov.

TERRELL
Don't tell me you've got something.

CHEKOV
(points)
We've picked up a minor energy flux
reading on one dyno scanner.

TERRELL
Damn! Are you sure? Maybe the
scanner's out of adjustment --

CHEKOV
I suppose it could be a particle
of preanimate matter caught in the
matrix...

TERRELL
All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to
Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something
we can transplant.

CHEKOV
You know what she'll say...

8   EXT. DEEP SPACE - REGULA I SPACE STATION                     8

A functional cluster of modules serve as a scientific
complex, a futuristic White Sands, orbiting a small
barren plantoid in b.g.: Regula.

CAROL MARCUS'S VOICE
(FILTERED)
Something you can transplant? I
don't know --

9   INT. SPACE STATION - CAROL'S LAB                             9

Big but deserted except for Carol, in contact with
Reliant. Surrounded by equipment clearly meant for
many workers, CAROL MARCUS is in her early forties,
attractive and intelligent. Static mars the trans-
missions.

On the monitor: Terrell and Chekov, looking hopeful.

TERRELL
It might only be a particle of
preanimate matter...

CAROL
Then again it might not. You
boys have to be clear on this:
there can't be so much as a
microbe or the show's off.
(she thinks)
Why don't you have a look? If it
IS something that can be moved...

TERRELL
(eager)
You bet, doctor. We're on our way!

Carol sighs as the image fades, not happy.

10   INT. CORRIDOR, SPACE STATION REGULA I                       10

Carol walks through the labyrinthine complex with
DAVID, her son, a bright young scientist of twenty.
He is good looking and humorous.

DAVID
How can you let them pull that
stuff on you? They're just lazy.

CAROL
And bored. I know. But maybe it
IS something they can...

DAVID
Come on, Mother, that's just the
military mentality. Never put off
tomorrow what you can put off today.
If there's one atom of life...

CAROL
I know, I know...

Silence.

DAVID
Well, don't have kittens.
Genesis is going to work. They'll
remember  you in a wreath with
Newton, Einstein, Surak...

CAROL
(mock outrage)
Thanks a lot. No respect from my
offspring --

DAVID
Par for the course... you teaming
up with me for bridge after dinner?

CAROL
Maybe...

DAVID
Every time we have dealings with
Starfleet, I get nervous.
(shrugs)
We're dealing with something
that COULD be perverted into
a dreadful weapon. Remember that
overgrown boy scout you used to
hang out with? That's exactly
the --

They walk past the CAMERA, their VOICES FADING.

CAROL
Listen, kiddo, Jim Kirk was many
things, but he was never a Boy
Scout...

HOLD ON the empty corridor.

11   INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT, TERRA - NIGHT                        11

Kirk reads the novel, trying to focus. His flat befits
an Admiral and a loner with few possessions, except
a collection of antiques.

WE HEAR A SOFT BONG.

Startled, Kirk lowers the book and pushes a button.

KIRK
Come.

The door slides open and Bones enters. He carries two
packages, one of them wrapped in brown paper.

KIRK
(continuing)
Bless me, doctor; and what beams
you into this neck of the woods?

BONES
'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.'
Happy Birthday...

With a flourish, he pulls out a bottle of blue
liquid.

KIRK
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know
this stuff is illegal --

BONES
(broad)
I only use it for medicinal
purposes. Don't be a pring...

KIRK
(reading the label
with difficulty)
Twenty-two, eighty-three...

BONES
Takes the stuff a while to
ferment. Gimme.

He takes the bottle and pours; continues talking.

BONES
(continuing)
Now open the other one.

Kirk starts to obey.

KIRK
I'm almost afraid to. What did
you bring me, contraband Klingon --

BONES
More antiques for your collection
-- Cheers!

They drink. The package is opened: a pair of gold
"Ben Franklin" half-glasses. (N.B.: Romulan Ale is
an INSTANT DRUNK: both men react.)

KIRK
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.

BONES
Four hundred years old. You don't
find many with the lens still
intact.

KIRK
Uh -- what are they?

BONES
For your eyes. For most patients
of your age, I generally administer
Retlax Five to restore flexibility
of the lens.

KIRK
But I'm allergic to Retlax.

BONES
Exactly. Happy birthday.

He toasts. Kirk is unsure how they work.

BONES
(continuing)
Slide them down your nose. Now look
at me over the top. And you read
printed matter through the bottom.

KIRK
(reacts)
Amazing! I don't know what to say --

BONES
Say thank you.

KIRK
Thank you.

An awkward silence.

BONES
Damn it, Jim, what the hell's the
matter? Other people have birthdays.
Why're we treating yours like a funeral?

KIRK
Bones, I don't want to be lectured.

BONES
What DO you want? Damn it, why
isn't there a girl here? You know
this has nothing to do with age.
This is about you flying a goddamn
computer console when you wanna be
out hopping Galaxies.

KIRK
Spare me your notions of poetry,
please. We all have our assigned
duties and...

BONES
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding
behind the rules and regulations --

KIRK
And who am I hiding from?

BONES
From yourself, Admiral.

Pause. Kirk pours another drink.

KIRK
Don't mince words, Bones; tell
me what you really think.

BONES
(mild take)
I'm your doctor and I'm your friend,
Jim. Get back your command. Get it
back before you really do grow old.
Before you turn into part of this
collection.

They look at each other.

12   EXT. RELIANT - DEEP SPACE                                   12

orbiting Ceti Alpha V.

VOICES OVER indicate the transporter room is ready.

13   OMITTED                                                     13

14   EXT. SURFACE CETI ALPHA V                                   14

A YELLOW PLANET, in constant SWIRLING HURRICANE WINDS
OF SAND. Terrell and Chekov materialize. Their VOICES,
filtered, are hard to make out.

With the TRICORDER to guide them, they set out...

TERRELL
Are you sure these are the
coordinates?

CHEKOV
Captain, this is the garden spot
of Ceti Alpha VI --

TERRELL
I can hardly see --

15   SEVERAL ANGLES                                              15

The difficult search, the men leaning into the wind --

16   TERRELL                                                     16

is ahead of Chekov on a slight rise --

CHEKOV
There's nothing, let's go --

17   ANGLE                                                       17

Terrell waves him frantically forward. As Chekov
moves up, we rise with him to the top of the ridge and
look down.

18   ANGLE - THEIR POV                                           18

A RUINED SERIES OF MAN-MADE STRUCTURES, half buried in
sand. They look at each other in consternation. Chekov
is worried; something about all this is familiar.

They descend towards the structures, now seen to be the
wreckage of some sort of space craft.

They pass but do not notice the FEDERATION LOGO, half
buried next to their feet.

TERRELL
They look like cargo carriers...

As Chekov looks at the porthole, a face suddenly looks
back! It is the face of a CHILD! The Apparition
scares the daylights out of Chekov -- and us. He
screams.

TERRELL
(continuing)
What is it?

He comes clumsily over --

CHEKOV
A face! I saw -- it was like a
child --

He points. The porthole is empty.

TERRELL
You're crazy -- !

CHEKOV
I saw it -- !

TERRELL
There's an air-lock.

He points and they go into the airlock.

19   INT. CARGO HOLD                                             19

Terrell and Chekov enter, dumbfounded. THEIR POV.
Someone lives here -- there are beds, food, all jury-
rigged -- but no people. Terrell checks a monitor.

TERRELL
There's breathable atmosphere in here.

He takes off his helmet; Chekov likewise.

TERRELL
(continuing)
What the hell is this? Did they
crash? Where's the rest of the
ship?

They wander as they talk, picking up objects that be-
speak a fairly sophisticated ad hoc environment: a
laboratory in one hold; a kitchen; A LARGE SAND TANK
filled with disgusting CETI EELS.

ABRUPTLY A SOUND -- They start: CHILD'S GURGLE.

CHEKOV
(terrified)
I told you! I told you I saw a --

TERRELL
Ssssh!

They start looking. They enter a new chamber --

20   KHAN'S QUARTERS                                             20

On its side in the sand: the walls are now the floor,
etc. All in crookedness -- like its owner. On the
floor, smiling at them (i.e., the wall) is a BABY.

Tentatively they come over to it, looking around --

21   ANGLE - CHEKOV'S POV                                        21

Lethal-looking odd swords on one wall, a bookshelf;
CAMERA PANS by 20th Century volumes; MOBY DICK, KING
LEAR, THE HOLY BIBLE -- and a seat belt dangling with
the name on it -- Botany Bay.

Chekov mouths the words, softly at first, then aloud --

CHEKOV
Botany Bay -- oh no!

TERRELL
(examines the child)
What's the matter -- ?

Chekov runs, tries to get his helmet on, tries to drag
Terrell --

CHEKOV
Captain, we've got to get out of
here -- now! Damn! Hurry!

Terrell catches his urgency --

TERRELL
But the child --

CHEKOV
Never mind! Hurry!

22   EXT. CARGO HOLD AIRBAY                                      22

Terrell and Chekov emerge, helmeted, then stop dead.

23   ANGLE - THEIR POV                                           23

A RING OF SUITED FIGURES has them surrounded.

24   INT. RELIANT - THE BRIDGE                                   24

Mr. Beach, the duty officer, stands looking at Ceti
Alpha V on the forward screen.

BEACH
Try again.

KYLE
Starship Reliant to Captain Terrell
... This is Lieutenant Kyle. Will
you please respond, Captain...
Captain Terrell, respond please.

Nothing.

BEACH
(thinks)
Let's give them a little more
time.

25   INT. CARGO HOLD - CETI ALPHA V                              25

Terrell and Chekov are held by FOUR STRONG MEN.

They seem to be waiting. One of the men is JOACHIM.

Out of the airlock steps a tall masked figure. A
moment of suspense as Terrell and Chekov watch, terri-
fied. The mask is peeled back.

CHEKOV
(aloud despite himself)
Khan!

KHAN is startled by the recognition; comes over and
examines Chekov and Terrell.

KHAN
(finally)
I don't know you. But you. I never
forget a face. Mister Chekov,
isn't it?
(wonderingly)
I never thought to see your face
again.

TERRELL
Chekov, who is this man?

CHEKOV
A criminal, Captain -- a product of
the late 20th Century genetic
engineering --

TERRELL
What do you want with us? I demand --

KHAN
(mild)
You are in a position to demand
nothing, sir. I, on the other hand,
am in a position to grant nothing.
What you see is all that remains of
the ship's company and the crew of the
Botany Bay, marooned here fifteen
years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.

TERRELL
Listen to me -- you men and women --

KHAN
Save your strength, Captain, these
people have sworn to live and die at
my command two hundred years before
you were born. Do you mean he...
(i.e. Chekov)
... never told you the tale?
To amuse you, Captain? Never told
you how the Enterprise picked up the
Botany Bay, lost in space from the
year 1996, myself and the ship's
company in cryogenic freeze?

TERRELL
I've never even met Admiral Kirk --

KHAN
Admiral? He didn't tell you how
Admiral Kirk sent seventy of us into
exile on this barren sand heap with
only the contents of these cargo bays
to sustain us?

CHEKOV
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was
life, a fair chance to --

KHAN
This is Ceti Alpha V! Ceti Alpha VI
exploded six months after we were
left here. The shock shifted the
orbit of this planet and everything
was laid waste. Admiral Kirk never
bothered to check on our progress.
It was only the fact of my genetically
engineered intellect that enabled us
to survive! On earth, two hundred
years ago, I was a prince, with power
over millions -- now, like Prometheus
I have been left by Admiral Kirk to
digest my own entrails.

CHEKOV
Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid
his hospitality by trying to steal his
ship and murder him.

KHAN
(moves closer)
And I'll wager he never told you
about his shipmate, the beautiful
and courageous Lieutenant McGiver,
who gave up everything to join me
in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how
Admiral Kirk requited her devotion --
She's dead as earth!

The wind howls in the silence. When Khan turns, his
eyes are filled with tears.

KHAN
(continuing)
A plague upon you all.

He recovers his poise and returns to them --

KHAN
(continuing)
You didn't expect to find me.
You thought this was Ceti Alpha VI.
Why are you here?

They don't answer. Khan goes over to Terrell and, WITH
ONE HAND, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR --

KHAN
(continuing)
Why?

Terrell gasps, stays silent --

KHAN
(continuing)
No matter.

He lets go; Terrell falls with a thud --

KHAN
(continuing)
You will soon tell me willingly
enough.

He goes over to the tank and dips a kind of strainer in,
pulling out TWO CETI EELS -- wriggling items --

KHAN
(continuing)
Let me introduce you to Ceti Alpha V's
only remaining indigenous life form;
what do you think? They've killed
twenty of my people, including my
beloved wife. Oh, not all at once
and not instantly, to be sure. Their
young enter through the ears and wrap
themselves around the cerebral cortex.
This has the effect of rendering the
victim extremely susceptible to
suggestion. Later, as they grow,
follows madness, paralysis -- and
death. These are pets, of course --
not quite domesticated.

As he speaks, Khan dumps an eel in each of their helmets;
he swirls the helmets around as though he were mixing
martinis --

CHEKOV
Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk
was only doing his duty! You --

26   CLOSE UP - KHAN - CAMERA IN                                 26

KHAN
There is some pain at first, I am
told, and then the effects are quite
benign -- until the end. That was
what I learned from watching my wife.

At a sign, the helmets are slammed down. As the muffled
shrieks are heard from within, the eels crawl across
the faces of Chekov and Terrell; with unerring in-
stincts they head for the ears of the two hapless men.
There is some atrocious pain as they enter -- then
dazed calm.

KHAN
(continuing)
That's better! Now: tell me why
you are here -- and tell me where I
may find James Kirk.

27   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE                                         27

KYLE
Captain Terrell. Captain Terrell...
This is Reliant; please respond.

No answer -- Beach makes up his mind --

BEACH
Mr. Kyle, muster a landing party
with full arms. Alert the
transporter room. We're beaming
down.

He heads for the door but is stopped by:

TERRELL'S VOICE
(filtered)
Reliant, this is Terrell. Respond
please.

BEACH
This is Reliant. Clark, are you
all right?

Fractional pause.

TERRELL'S VOICE
(filtered)
Everything's fine, commander. I'll
explain when I see you. Oh, by the
way, we're bringing several guests
aboard. Prepare to beam up on my
next signal. Terrell out.

Beach and Kyle look at each other.

KYLE
Guests?

BEACH
Maybe we ARE transplanting something.

29   INT. SPACE SHUTTLE                                          29

A new composite. Bones, Sulu, Uhura and Kirk -- who
sits, reading. Through the windows we can see the
approach to the starship ENTERPRISE. Kirk looks up,
nods. Sulu activates a comm button.

SULU
Enterprise, this is Admiral Kirk's
party on final approach.

ENTERPRISE VOICE
(filtered)
Enterprise welcomes you. Prepare
for docking.

Kirk looks up from his book as Sulu sits next to him.

KIRK
I really must thank you.

SULU
(embarrassed)
I am delighted; any chance to go
aboard Enterprise, however briefly,
is always an excuse for nostalgia.

KIRK
I cut your new orders personally. By
the end of the month, you'll have your
first command: USS EXCELSIOR.

SULU
Thank you, sir. I've looked
forward to this for a long time.

KIRK
You've earned it. But I'm still
grateful to have you at the helm
for three weeks. I don't believe
these kids can steer.

Sulu laughs.

32   INT. ENTERPRISE DOCKING BAY                                 32

A reception group awaits, led by Captain Spock. Saavik
stands at his side, in company of the Trainee crew.
Also present: CHIEF ENGINEER MR. SCOTT and members of
his staff in their distinctive uniforms.

INTERCOM VOICE
Docking procedure complete.

SPOCK
Prepare for Admiral's inspection.

The group comes to attention.

SPOCK
(continuing)
Open the Air Lock.

The doors open. Kirk and his staff are piped aboard
by an electronic version of the boatswain's tradi-
tional whistle. Kirk salutes the Federation symbol
and steps forward to exchange salutes with Spock.

KIRK
Permission to come aboard, Captain?

SPOCK
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe
you know my trainee crew. Certainly
they have come to know you.

KIRK
(dryly to Saavik)
Yes, we've been through death and
life together.

Saavik stiffens slightly -- humor is not her forte.

KIRK
(continuing to Scotty)
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're
well?

SCOTTY
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy
pulled me through.

KIRK
Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?

Uncomfortable, Scotty exchanges a glance with Bones --

BONES
Shore leave, Admiral.

KIRK
Ah.

He stops before a BRIGHT-FACED FOURTEEN-YEAR OLD, stand-
ing so stiff he looks like he'll break -- in an
engineer's uniform.

KIRK
(continuing)
And who is this?

PRESTON
(breathless)
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston,
engineers mate, SIR.

A big salute. Kirk is amused, returns the salute.

KIRK
Your first training voyage, Mr.
Preston?

PRESTON
Yes, SIR.

KIRK
I see. Well, shall we start with
the engine room?

He moves, followed by his staff.

SCOTTY
(eyeing his prot g )
I believe you'll find all in order --

SPOCK
We'll see you on the bridge, Admiral.

KIRK
Very good, Mr. Spock.

Kirk and party leave. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON SPOCK AND
SAAVIK.

SAAVIK
He's not what I expected, Sir.

SPOCK
What did you expect, Lieutenant?

SAAVIK
(uncertain)
He's very human.

SPOCK
We can't all be perfect, Saavik.
You must control your prejudices
and remember that as a Vulcan as
well as a Romulan you are forever
a stranger in an alien land.
Around you are humans, and as a
member of the Starfleet you are
unlikely ever to escape their
presence or their influence.
You must learn to tolerance in addition
to all else I have taught you.
Tolerance is logical.

Saavik is humbled.

SAAVIK
As always, my mentor. Company dismiss.

33   INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM - LOOKING DOWN                  33

The inspection party dwarfed by the size. Silence as
Kirk looks around, runs a finger for dust, etc.
Scotty, his team and Preston, stand at attention.

34   ANGLE - FLOOR OF ENGINE ROOM                                34

FEATURING power room separated by glass from the rest
of the facilities. Bones, Sulu, Uhura, and some train-
ees watch as Kirk inspects one console, clearly the
responsibility of the bursting Midshipman Preston.

PRESTON
(blurting)
I believe you'll find everything
shipshape, Admiral.

KIRK
(sternly puts
him on)
Oh do you? Have you any idea,
Midshipman Preston, how many times
I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on
the Comm, telling me his troubles?
Have you any idea the ribbing I've
had to endure in the officers' mess
to the effect that the Enterprise
is a flying death trap?

PRESTON
(scandalized)
Oh, no, sir! This is the finest
engine room in the whole Star --

The repressed grins of the others, and a smile on Scotty's
face tell Preston he's being had. He stops, confused.

PRESTON
(continuing)
If the Admiral can't see the facts
for himself, then, with all due
respect, he's as blind as a Tiberion
bat. SIR.

Approving laughter. Kirk looks amused.

KIRK
Midshipman, you're a tiger.

SCOTTY
My sister's youngest, Admiral.
Crazy to get to space.

KIRK
Every young boy's fancy. I seem
to remember it myself.
(brisk)
Very well. Mr. Scott, are your
engines capable of handling a minor
training cruise?

SCOTTY
Give the word, Admiral.

KIRK
Mr. Scott, the word is given.

SCOTTY
Aye, sir.

He moves off, followed by Preston, who gives one last
salute as Kirk leaves, followed by Bones.

BONES
(dry)
What about the rest of the
inspection, Admiral?

KIRK
The inspection will continue once
we're underway, Doctor.

They step into the Turbo Lifts.

35   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                      35

The real one, no doubt! CAMERA REVEALS the maze detail:
winking and blinking displays, all HANDS at station,
a hum of activity, Uhura and Sulu in familiar chairs,
Spock is in the Captain's chair, Saavik in the First
Officer's position. Kirk and Bones stand towards the
rear.

INTERCOM VOICE
This is Starfleet operations.
Enterprise is cleared for departure.

SULU
Admiral on the bridge!

SPOCK
Very well, Mr. Saavik, clear all
moorings.

SAAVIK
Aye, sir.

Saavik punches data into her console.

The dock slowly folds away from the ship.

37   INT. BRIDGE, ENTERPRISE                                     37

Saavik watches instruments, punches data in response.

SAAVIK
All moorings are clear, Captain.

SPOCK
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.

Spock casts a glance at Kirk, then, to Saavik:

SPOCK
(continuing)
Lieutenant, how many times have you
piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?

SAAVIK
Never, sir.

Kirk tries to conceal his reaction. Spock enjoys it.

SPOCK
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.

SAAVIK
Aye, sir.

Saavik settles herself in the chair, looks again at
the console -- Spock looks at Kirk.

SPOCK
There's a first time for everything,
Admiral.

KIRK
(casual)
To be sure, Captain.

They all stifle their responses. Kirk is like a father
watching his kid drive the family car for the first time.

SAAVIK
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.

SULU
Aft thrusters, sir.

Activity hums.

SAAVIK

Kirk starts to say something, but doesn't. Bones looks
at him.

BONES

Would you like a tranquilizer?

Kirk shakes his head, takes a breath --

SULU
Ahead one quarter impulse power.

The ship clears the dock and begins heading into space.

Kirk quietly lets his breath out.

SULU
We are clear and free to navigate.

SAAVIK
Course heading, Captain?

Spock turns inquiringly to Kirk.

KIRK
Captain's discretion.

Spock digests this with a slight smile.

SPOCK
Mr. Sulu, you may follow your nose.

Khan occupies the Captain's chair. We PULL BACK: the
crew of the RELIANT has been replaced by Khan's fol-
lowers in their odd-looking clothes.

At the helm is Joachim, Khan's lieutenant. He is in the
largest and brightest of Khan's group. Terrell sits in
the First Officer's chair, Chekov at the Comm Console.
Their behavior is normal, save for subtle hesitation,
symptoms of their mind-controlled state.

JOACHIM
Steady on course. All systems normal.

KHAN
It's not much different from
Enterprise.
(beat)
When I was a guest aboard her some
years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed
me to memorize her technical manuals.
And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review:
You say you have no details of
Project 'Genesis' ?

CHEKOV
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is
classified information.

KHAN
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have
access to such information?

CHEKOV
I would think so, sir. He's on the
Fleet General Staff.

KHAN
Then to whom do you report directly
regarding Genesis?

CHEKOV
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian
director of the experiments on Space
Laboratory Regula I.

KHAN
(thinks)
I see. Helmsman?

HELMSMAN
Aye, sir.

JOACHIM
May I speak? We're all with you,
sir, but consider: we are free,
we have a ship and the means to
go where we will. We have
escaped permanent exile on Ceti
Alpha V. You have proved your
superior intellect and defeated
the plans of Admiral Kirk.
You do not need to defeat him
again.

KHAN
He tasks me -- and I'll have him. I'll
chase him round the moons of Nibia
and round the Antares maelstrom and
round perdition's flames before I give
him up.
(as no one speaks)
Prepare to alter course -- for Space
Station Regula I.

47   INT. CAROL'S LAB                                            47

Huge and busy. Among the scientists going about their
tasks are JEDDA, a Deltan; MARCH, thin intense;
MADISON, black, easy going. They are all young and
earnest. Carol and David huddle over a computer
console.

DAVID
Does that about do it?

CAROL
I don't think there's another piece
of information we could squeeze
into the memory banks. Next
time, we'll design a bigger
one.

DAVID
Who --

Jedda at the Comm Console overlaps.

JEDDA
Comm-Pic coming in on hyperchannel
... It's Reliant.

Carol moves forward as the others close in.

CAROL
On the screen, please, Jedda.

Buttons punched; the screen ebbs, flows and crackles
on. ON SCREEN is CHEKOV.

CHEKOV
... come in, please. This is Reliant
calling Regula I. Repeat. This is
USS Reliant --

CAROL
Commander, we are receiving. This
is Regula I. Go ahead.

CHEKOV
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route
to you and should be there in three
days.

CAROL
En route? Why? We weren't expecting
you for another three months. Has
something happened?
(pause)
Has something happened? Do you read
us?

CHEKOV
(fractional pause)
All went well. Nothing has happened.
Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.

Pleased reaction from the scientists.

CAROL
I still don't under --

CHEKOV
We have received new orders. Upon our
arrival at Regula I, all materials of
Project Genesis will be transferred to
this ship for immediate testing at
Ceti Alpha VI.

Consternation in the lab. David is livid -- the words
"Bullshit" are overlapped  by his mother.

CAROL
Will you please be quiet!
(back to console)
Commander Chekov, this is completely
irregular. Who gave the order you
are quoting? Who gave the order?

CHEKOV
(still smiling)
The order comes from Starfleet
command, Dr. Marcus, direct from
the General Staff.

CAROL
But Genesis is a civilian project,
under my control --

CHEKOV
I have my orders.

DAVID
Pin him down, mother! Who gave the
orders!?

Chekov hesitates, seems to be listening to someone off
the monitor.

CHEKOV
The orders come from Admiral James
T. Kirk.

Sensation in the lab.

DAVID
I knew it! I knew it! All along
the military has wanted to get their
hands on this --

He starts to press a button; Carol pushes his hand
away and communicates herself.

CAROL
This is completely improper,
Commander Chekov. I have no
intention of allowing Reliant or
any other unauthorized personnel
access to our work or materials.

CHEKOV
(pauses; listens)
I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor.
Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed.
Please prepare to deliver Genesis to
us upon our arrival. Reliant out.

The image fades.

CAROL
Commander Chekov -- !

48   INT. BRIDGE OF RELIANT                                      48

Chekov, in a matched cut, turns away as CAMERA WIDENS
TO REVEAL KHAN by his side. He is charming.

KHAN
Well done, Commander.

CHEKOV
You realize, sir, that they will
attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and
confirm the order.

Khan smiles, more charming than ever as we move in.

49   INT. REGULA I LAB                                           49

Everyone is talking at once.

CAROL
Will you please be quiet! We must
have order here.
(as they subside)
This has to be some sort of mistake.

DAVID
Mistake? We're all alone here.
They waited until everyone was on
shift-leave to do this. Reliant is
supposed to be at our disposal, not
vice-versa.

MADISON
It seems clear that Starfleet never
intended that --

CAROL
I know, but --

DAVID
I've tried to warn you. Scientists
are always pawns of the military --

CAROL
(angry)
Starfleet has kept the peace for
a hundred years, I cannot and
will not subscribe to your
interpretation of this event.

Silence.

JEDDA
(Deltan cool)
You may be right, Doctor, but what
about Reliant? She's on her way.

Carol reacts: this is certainly true.

CAROL
Get your gear together where it's
handy.

MARCH
Where are we going?

CAROL
That's for us to know and Reliant
to find out. We have only three
days. Let's not waste time.

They split off in different directions as ordered.

Kirk waits for the Turbo Lift, which opens at last. As
he gets in --

SAAVIK'S VOICE
Hold please -- !

Kirk holds and Saavik dashes in. She is surprised to
see him.

SAAVIK
(continuing)
Thank you, sir.

Kirk nods, the doors close. There is an uneasy forced
intimacy between them.

KIRK
Lieutenant, are you wearing your
hair differently?

SAAVIK
It is still regulation, Admiral.

She reaches out and touches a button. The lift stops.

SAAVIK
(continuing)
May I speak, sir?

KIRK
Lieutenant, self-expression does not
seem to be one of your problems.

SAAVIK
I wish to thank you for the high
efficiency rating.

KIRK
You earned it.

SAAVIK
I did not think so.

KIRK
You're bothered by your performance
on the Kobayashi Maru.

SAAVIK
I failed to resolve the situation.

KIRK
There is no correct resolution.
It is a test of character.

SAAVIK
May I ask how you dealt with the
test?

KIRK
(amused)
You may ask, Lieutenant.

She stares.

KIRK
(continuing)
That was a little joke.

SAAVIK
Humor... that is a difficult concept
... it is not logical...

KIRK
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.

She's a laugh a minute. Kirk pushes the button; the
elevator starts.

KIRK
(continuing)
You want my advice?

She studies him, considering. No doubt about it, the
attraction is mutual and she has no idea how to handle
it.

SAAVIK
Yes.

KIRK
Take the test again.

The lift stops and the doors open.

BONES
Who's been holding up the damn
elevator?

He reacts to them. Saavik exits demurely.

SAAVIK
Thank you, sir.

Bones enters and the doors close. Kirk studies the
ceiling.

BONES
Has she changed her hairstyle?

Kirk says nothing.

BONES

Wonderful stuff, that Romulan
ale --

UHURA'S VOICE

KIRK
Kirk here.

UHURA'S VOICE

Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr.
Carol Marcus.

KIRK

UHURA'S VOICE
Yes, sir.

Awkward silence.

BONES
It never rains but when it pours --

KIRK
As a physician you of all people
should appreciate the danger of
re-opening old wounds.

The elevator stops. Kirk leaves. The doors close.

BONES

himself)
Sorry.

KIRK
Uhura. Can't you augment?

UHURA

Carol's face appears. The image will never be stable
for long; sometimes the sound will be covered.

CAROL
Jim... read me? Can you read me?

KIRK
Message breaking up, Carol. What's

CAROL

let them have... without proper...

But the picture is irrevocably scrambled now. Kirk

strides in. Bones and Saavik react to the following:

KIRK
Stop engines.

SULU
Stop engines.

They look wonderingly. Kirk takes a breath --

KIRK
An emergency situation has arisen.
By order of Starfleet Command, as
of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming
command of this vessel. Duty officer
so note in the ship's log. Plot a
new course: for Space Laboratory
Regula I.

Mr. Scott?

SCOTTY'S VOICE
Aye, sir.

KIRK
We'll be going to warp speed --

SCOTTY'S VOICE
Aye, sir --

SULU

KIRK
Engage warp engines --

SAAVIK

stunned)
Prepare for warp speed.

SULU

KIRK
Mr. Sulu, go to Warp 5.

Sulu does, and with a great thrust of energy --

Spock is at meditation as Kirk enters quietly. Spock
looks up.

KIRK
We've got a problem.

Spock raises an eyebrow --

KIRK
(continuing)
Something may be wrong at Regula
I. We've been ordered to investigate.

SPOCK
Regula I is a scientific research
laboratory, if memory serves...

KIRK
I told Starfleet all we had was a
boatload of children but we're the
only ship in the quadrant. Spock:
those cadets of yours -- how good
are they? How will they respond
under real pressure?

SPOCK
Like all living beings, Admiral
each according to his gifts. The
ship is yours.

KIRK
That won't be necessary: just take
me to Regula I.

SPOCK
Excuse my presumption, but I do not
agree. As a teacher on a training
mission, I am content to command a
Starship. If we are to go on actual
duty, it is clear that the senior
officer aboard must assume command.

KIRK
But it may be nothing; garbled
communications. Why don't you...

SPOCK
You proceed from a false assumption.
I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.

Kirk smiles in bemused wonderment.

KIRK
You are going to remind me that
logic alone dictates your actions.

SPOCK
I was going to remind you of nothing,
least of all that which you know well.
(pause)
Your mistake, if I may be so bold,
was promotion. Commanding a Starship
is your first best destiny. Anything
else is a waste of material.

KIRK
I would not presume to debate you.

SPOCK
That is wise. In any case, were I
to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates
that the needs of the many outweigh
the needs of the few.

KIRK
Or the one.

Spock inclines his head.

SPOCK
You are my superior officer. You
are also my friend. I have been
and always shall be yours.

Kirk is moved. He starts to speak, can't -- finally:

KIRK
Will you accompany me to the bridge?

SPOCK
I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first
so that he may, in his own words,
explain the situation to his cadets.

Kirk's face tells us the wisdom of Spock's choice.

UHURA

Dr. Marcus. Please respond, please
-- it's no use; no response from
Regula I.

SPOCK
But no longer jammed?

UHURA
No, sir. No nothing.

Spock considers, moves to Kirk.

SPOCK
There are two possibilities, sir
they are unwilling to respond, they
are unable to respond.

KIRK
How far?

SPOCK
Twelve hours and forty-three
minutes, present speed.

KIRK
Give up Genesis, she said. What in
God's name does that mean? Give it
up to whom?

SPOCK
It might help my analysis if I knew
what Genesis was.

Kirk looks at him, nods; rising now.

KIRK
Uhura, ask Dr. McCoy to join us in
my quarters. Mr. Saavik, take the
con.

They start for the Turbo Lifts as Saavik reacts --

CAROL
-- Unleashing, almost instantan-
eously, what we call the Genesis
effect. Particulate matter is
reorganized and electrified --
with life introduced results.
Instead of a dead moon, a living
breathing planet, capable of sus-
taining whatever life forms we
see fit to deposit on it... The
reformed object you see represents
the merest fraction of the Genesis
potential, should the Federation
wish to pursue these experiments to
their logical conclusion.

67A   BACK TO CAROL IN LAB                                       67A

CAROL
When we consider the problems of
population and food supply, the
usefulness of this process begins
to become clear.
This concludes this demonstration
tape. Thank you for your attention.
The Genesis team eagerly awaits the
decision of the Federation regarding
the next phase of our work.

The tape becomes snowy and blinks off.

Kirk looks at Bones and Spock -- they are stunned.

SPOCK
It literally is Genesis...

KIRK
The power of creation --

SPOCK
Have they proceeded with their
experiments?

KIRK
The tape was made a year ago. I
can only assume they've reached
Phase Two by now --

BONES
But dear Lord, are we intelligent
enough to -- Suppose, this
thing were used where life already
exists?

SPOCK
It would destroy such life in favor
of its new matrix --

BONES
It's new -- have you any idea what
you're saying?

SPOCK
I was not attempting to evaluate
its moral implications, Doctor.
As a matter of cosmic history, it
has always been easier to destroy
than to create --

BONES
Not anymore! Now you can do both
at the same time! According to myth,
the earth was created in six days.
Watch out: here comes Genesis;
we'll do it for you in six minutes --

SPOCK
I don't dispute that in the wrong
hands --

BONES
Would you like to tell me whose
are the right hands, my cold-blooded
friend? Are you in favor of these
experiments?

KIRK
Gentlemen, this isn't --

SPOCK
Really, Dr. McCoy; you cannot ban
the acquisition of knowledge
because you distrust the moral
implications of what you learn.
Logic suggests --

BONES
Logic?? We're talking about
universal Armageddon, you inhuman
bloodless...

SAAVIK'S VOICE
(intercom)
Admiral, sensors indicate a vessel
in our area, closing fast.

KIRK
What do you make of her?

SAAVIK'S VOICE
It's one of ours, Admiral... It's
Reliant.

SPOCK
What's she doing here?

KIRK
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?

68   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                      68

The whoosh of the turbo doors and Kirk, Bones and
Spock assume their posts. Saavik stands next to Kirk's
chair.

UHURA
She's not responding...

KIRK
Try the emergency channels...

UHURA
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in,
Reliant.

KIRK

Is it possible their COMM system

It would explain a great many things --

Khan and his crew; no sign of Chekov and Terrell. On
Khan's screen, the Enterprise grows larger --

KHAN

with joy)
Slow to one-half impulse power.
Let's be friends...

HELMSMAN
Slowing to one-half impulse.

JOACHIM
They're requesting visual
communications, sir.

KHAN
Let them eat static.

JOACHIM
They're still running with shields down.

KHAN
Of course. We're one big happy fleet.
Ah, Kirk, my old friend, do you know
the Klingon proverb that tells us
revenge is a dish that is best
served cold?
(pause)
It is very cold in space.

72   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                      72

SPOCK
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware
of the Regulations.

SAAVIK
Aye, sir.

KIRK
(watches the
screen)
This is damned peculiar.
(beat)
Yellow alert.

SAAVIK
Energize defense fields.

ALARMS SOUND. The lights on the bridge dim into the
soft reddish glow of battle illumination. ADDITIONAL
CREW troop in to man vacant consoles.

UHURA
I'm getting a voice message... wait
... short range band. They say their
Chambers coil is shorting their COMM

KIRK
Spock?

SPOCK
Scanning...

He steps to his station.

73   EXT. SPACE                                                  73

The two ships are very close, barely moving as they inch
toward each other.

JOACHIM
They still haven't raised their
shields.

Khan is half out of his seat, sweating with anticipation.

KHAN
Careful: Not all at once. The

prepare to fire.

JOACHIM
Locking phasers on target.

SPOCK
Their coil emissions are normal...
Wait: their shields are going up.
They're locking phasers -- !

KIRK
Raise shields! Energize phasers,

But the ENTIRE BRIDGE is ROCKED by a shock impact, some
of the crew sent flying.

76   EXT.SPACE                                                   76

Reliant firing phasers at Enterprise. A hit in the rear
of the engine room area, debris flying into the void.

77   INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM                                 77

An explosion rips through the facility, sending yellow-
ish green GAS hurtling down the long facility towards us.
Crewmen are hurled through the air, screaming.

SCOTTY
Respirators! Get back! Use your
respirators!

And he puts his own respirator on, as do some of the
veterans. Preston dons his respirator -- and stays.

81   HIGH ANGLE - ENGINE ROOM                                    81

The angle we saw during inspection. The trainees, in
panic amid the gas crawl over each other trying to get
out. They scramble over each other's shoulders in the
efforts to escape, screaming and shouting.

82   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                      82

The bridge is slowly righting. Crew members getting
back to their stations. On speaker, we hear the CRIES
AND SHOUTS of the Engine Room.

KIRK
Mr. Sulu... The shields!

SULU
Trying, sir!

INTERCOM VOICE
Medical Alert: Engine Room.

Bones dashes out.

SULU
I can't get power, sir!

KIRK
Scotty!

Scotty's voice is faint, drowned by the screams and
cries from a dozen intercom stations.

KIRK
(continuing)
Uhura, turn off those damn
channels!!

Uhura does. There is a dead silence. Then:

UHURA
Mr. Scott on discrete.

KIRK
Scotty, let's have it.

83   INT. ENGINE ROOM - FAVORING SCOTTY                          83

Behind, the crew chief and a few others work feverishly
in respirators. Scotty, in respirator, with a throat
mike which filters his voice.

SCOTTY
Just hanging on, sir. Main energizers
out.

ON SCREEN computer graphics, red flashing lights indi-
cate damaged areas. Spock steps up to Kirk evaluating
the display.

SPOCK
They knew just where to hit us.

KIRK
WHO? Who knew just where to hit
us? And why?

SPOCK
(shakes head)
One thing is certain; we cannot
escape on auxiliary power.

KIRK
Visual!
(sees visual)
Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the
phasers --

SPOCK
(re screen)
Too late --

On VISUAL SCREEN, Photon torpedoes approach...

KIRK
Hang on!

The bridge is shaken badly, screens go dark, fires spark
and erupt. ALARMS and SOUND full. Crew personnel try
to put out electrical fires, help the fallen --

The firefighting continues.

KIRK
Scotty -- what's left?

SCOTTY'S VOICE
Just the batteries, sir. I can have
auxiliary power in a few minutes --

KIRK
We don't have minutes. Can you
give me phaser power?

SCOTTY'S VOICE
A few shots, sir.

SPOCK
Not enough against their shields.

KIRK
Who the hell are they?

UHURA
Admiral... Commander Reliant is
signaling.
(a pause)
He wishes to discuss terms of our
surrender.

There is a moment. Kirk looks around the battered
bridge, and his eyes meet Spock's, and Saavik's.

KIRK
On screen.

UHURA
(hesitating)
Admiral --

KIRK
Do it, while we have time.

All eyes go to the SCREEN. After momentary visual
confusion, Khan's face appears, smiling --

KIRK
(continuing; dumbfounded)
Khan!

SAAVIK
Who?

KHAN
You still remember, Admiral. I
cannot help but be touched. Of
course, I remember you.

KIRK
What is the meaning of this attack?
Where is the crew of the Reliant?

KHAN
Surely I have made my meaning plain.
I mean to avenge myself upon you,
Admiral. I've deprived your ship of
power and when I swing round I mean
to deprive you of your life --

88   EXT. SPACE                                                  88

We can see Reliant making a large arc as she prepares to
come back for another round.

89   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                      89

KHAN
(on screen)
-- But I wanted you to know first
who it was who had beaten you: I,
Khan Noonian Singh, the eagle you
attempted to cage forever.

KIRK
Khan, listen to me -- if its me you
want, I'll have myself beamed aboard.
All I ask is that you spare my crew.

KHAN
That is a most intriguing offer.
Typical, I must say of your sterling
character. Let me think.

90   EXT. SPACE                                                  90

Reliant continues her slow arc.

91   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                      91

KHAN
(on screen)
I make you a counter-proposal, I will
agree to your terms, if in addition
to yourself, you turn over to me all
data and material regarding the
project called Genesis.

Reactions from Spock and Kirk.

KIRK
Genesis, what's that?

KHAN
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is
on the phaser control --

KIRK
Give me some time to recall the data
on our computers --

KHAN
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.

Kirk turns from the screen --

SPOCK
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...

KIRK
At least we know he hasn't got it.
Just keep nodding as though I'm
giving orders. Saavik, punch up the
data charts of Reliant's command
console -- hurry...

SAAVIK
Reliant's command...

KIRK
HURRY.

SPOCK
The prefix code?

KIRK
It's all we've got.

SAAVIK
On screen...

KIRK
(to Khan)
We're finding it.
(urging)
Please, please -- you've got to
give us time -- the bridge is
smashed, computers inoperative...

KHAN
Time is a luxury you do not have,
Admiral: forty-five seconds...

92   EXT. SPACE                                                  92

Reliant, her arc completed, is coming back.

93   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                      93

SAAVIK
I don't understand --

Kirk puts on his spectacles --

KIRK
You've got to learn WHY things
work on a Starship.
(to Khan)
It's coming through now, Khan...

SPOCK
(descends)
The prefix code is 16309. All
commands from each Starship bridge
are relayed electronically; each
ship has its own prefix combination
code...

KHAN
Thirty seconds...

KIRK
... to prevent an enemy from doing
just what we're attempting; using
our console to tap in a message,
an order to lower Reliant's damn
shields...

SPOCK
(at the weapons console)
Let's hope he hasn't changed the
combination. He's quite intelligent...

KIRK
(grim)
Wait for my signal, Spock -- too
soon and he'll have time to figure
it out and raise them again.

Spock nods; Kirk turns to the screen --

KIRK
(continuing)
Khan, how do I know you'll keep
your word?

KHAN
(on screen)
I've given you no word to keep,
Admiral. In my judgment, you simply
have no alternative.

KIRK
I take your point. Stand by to
receive our transmission.

He turns from the screen again, softly:

KIRK
(continuing)
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target
and await my command...

SULU
(quietly)
Phasers locked...

They're all sweating.

KHAN
Time's up, Admiral...

KIRK
(dry)
Here it comes. Now, Spock.

Sir -- our shields are dropping!

KHAN
Raise them --

Joachim punches frantically --

JOACHIM
They won't --

KHAN
Where's the over-ride??

All monitors are haywire now that Enterprise is tapped
in. They search wildly for the right switch, but...

Enterprise fires at Reliant inflicting heavy damage.

100   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE                                        100

A shambles -- debris flying; Khan knocked to the deck.
He struggles to his feet through wiring --

KHAN
(enraged)
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE!
Why can't you?

JOACHIM
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged
the photon controls and the warp
drive. We must withdraw!

KHAN
No!

JOACHIM
Sir, we must!
(desperate urging)
We must repair the damage. Enterprise
will wait; she's not going anywhere.

Khan calms as the other holds him; he breathes deeper.

101   EXT. SPACE                                                 101

Reliant turns away.

102   ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                          102

They watch on screen as Reliant hauls off.

SULU
(breathless)
Sir, you did it.

KIRK
(enraged)
I did nothing -- except get caught
with my britches down. I must be
senile. Mr. Saavik, you just keep
right on quoting regulations.
Meantime, let's find out what the
hell is going on and see how bad
we've been --

The turbo doors whoosh open as Kirk reaches them.
Scotty stands there, tears streaming down his face;
he holds the body of Midshipman Preston. Both of them
are covered in blood. He sways into Kirk's arms as
the others rush forward.

103   EXT. SPACE                                                 103

104   INT. ENGINE ROOM                                           104

The CREW, wearing respirators amid the motionless ball
of gas, work frantically at a dozen jobs, trying to put
things aright, splicing wires, etc. Some TRAINEES who
panicked are back.

105   FEATURE THE CREW CHIEF                                     105

making a final adjustment.

CREW CHIEF
Hit your blowers!

A TURBO WHINES and a great wind of suction pulls the
gas towards appropriate vents. The Crew Chief watches,
then yanks off his respirator; wipes his brow.

106   INT. SICK BAY                                              106

MANY CASUALTIES IN EVIDENCE. Kirk enters and LEADS
CAMERA THROUGH them; he has a word or two for men he
doesn't know by name. Kirk leads us to the operating
theatre, where Bones works over Preston. Scotty stands
by, his lips trembling. Preston opens his eyes, sees
Scotty and Kirk.

PRESTON
(faint)
Is the word given?

KIRK
(soft)
The word is given: warp speed.

PRESTON
(almost smiles)
Aye...

He dies. Pause. Scotty looks across the body at Kirk.

SCOTTY
WHY?

KIRK
(looks at Preston)
He wants to kill me for passing
sentence on him 14 years ago -- and
he doesn't care who stands between
him and his vengeance.

BONES
Scotty, I'm sorry...

SCOTTY
He stayed at his post. When the
trainees ran, he stayed.

KIRK
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.

SPOCK'S VOICE
Admiral, this is Spock.

Kirk hits a wall intercom --

KIRK
Yes, Spock.

SPOCK'S VOICE
Engine room reports auxiliary power
restored. We can proceed at impulse
power.

KIRK
(thinks)
Best speed to Regula I. Kirk
out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any
chance of getting the mains back on
the line?

SCOTTY
I dinna think so, sir, but you'll
have my best --

With an effort, he gets to his feet --

SCOTTY
(continuing)
Thanks -- I know you tried, Doctor...

Squeezes his shoulder and limps off -- We NOW HEAR
the sound of impulse power taking effect.

KIRK
Are you all right?

Bones shrugs unhappily, looks at Preston.

BONES
Doctors lose patients sometimes.
Damn. I'm still in the dark: How'd
he know about Genesis?

KIRK
At the moment that question takes
a back seat to preventing him from
laying his hands on it. You said it
yourself; we're talking about a bang
that would re-arrange the universe...

BONES
There may still be time... you gave
as good as you got.

KIRK
(looks him in the eye)
I got beat. We're only alive because
I knew something about these ships
that he didn't.

He turns and leaves as Bones watches, looks again at
Preston.

As before, Uhura's image, imploring a response.

UHURA
I say again. Space Station Regular.
This is Starship Enterprise. Please

During this, CAMERA HAS PANNED CLOSE AMONG the techni-
cal clutter. Then suddenly. SOUND -- eerie, frightening.
Our ears cannot place it... and before we can, it is gone
a warning.

111   BACK TO BRIDGE                                             111

UHURA
... No response, sir.

KIRK
Sensors, Captain?

SPOCK
Scanners and sensors still inoperative.
There's no way to tell what's  inside
the station.

KIRK
And no way of knowing if Reliant
is still in the area...

SPOCK
Affirmative, Admiral.

KIRK
(with irony)
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat.
What do you make of the plantoid
beyond?

SPOCK
Regula is class "D'. It consists of
various remarkable ores. Essentially,
a great rock in space.

KIRK
Reliant could be hiding behind that rock.

SPOCK
A distinct possibility.

KIRK
Engine room... Scotty, do we have
enough power for the transporters?

SCOTTY'S VOICE
Just barely, sir.

KIRK
(the decision)
I'm going down to the station.

He starts out. Bones stops him.

BONES
Khan could be down there!

KIRK
He's BEEN there and hasn't found
what he wants. Can you spare
someone? There may be people
hurt.

BONES
I can spare me...

SAAVIK
Begging the Admiral's pardon:
General Order 15: 'No  flag officer
shall beam into a hazardous area
without armed escort.'

KIRK
There is no such regulation.

Saavik's gaze falters --

KIRK
(continuing)
All right, join the party.
Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.

SPOCK
Aye sir --

KIRK
Establish a parking orbit around
the station and send me a complete
damage report when you've talked
with Mr. Scott.

SPOCK
Be careful, Jim...

Kirk, Bones and Saavik head for the turbo doors.

112   EXT. SPACE - SPACE STATION REGULAR I                       112

CLOSER ANGLE now. The silence is ominous.

113   INT. SPACE STATION REGULAR I - CAROL'S LAB                 113

empty, except for the hums and crackles of abandoned
equipment. With a FAMILIAR SOUND, BONES, KIRK and
SAAVIK MATERIALIZE. All have phasers, communicators
and tricorders.

For a moment they look around, seeing emptiness. Like
being in a haunted house.

KIRK
Hello...! Anybody here?

A WEIRD ECHO reverberates his cries.

SAAVIK
(raises tricorder)
Indeterminate life signs.

KIRK
Phasers on stun. Move out.

They separate. Each begins to search.

114   ANGLE WITH SAAVIK                                          114

She moves to the electronic and data area, examines the
consoles, the equipment, then settles for the data bank.
She starts keying sequences with the computer.

115   INT. SPACE STATION - BONES                                 115

He shows signs of fear as he walks through the deserted
place, like a scuba diver exploring a cave. We want
him to go back.

A NOISE. Bones reacts with brave apprehension.

Rounding a corner, he starts: A RAT scuttles right in
front of him.

Bones sighs with relief and moves forward. We think
he's safe.

SUDDENLY SOMETHING FALLS RIGHT ON HIS FACE: an upside
down human ARM.

116   SAME LOCALE - LATER                                        116

Kirk helps Bones cut down the last of the five BODIES
from where they were hanged, upside down.

Having recovered his composure, Bones examines the
corpses. We RECOGNIZE Madison, March, among others.

One is clearly the COOK.

KIRK
(stunned)
They even killed the galley chief.

BONES
This one looks like a Steward.
They're not warm, but rigor hasn't
set in. This didn't happen all that
long ago, Jim.

Kirk looks around, despairingly --

KIRK
Carol...

117   INT. SPACE LAB DATA BANK                                   117

WITH SAAVIK working with console. Something puzzles
her. She frowns, but a NEW SOUND distracts her. She
looks up and moves off.

118   FULL SHOT - IN THE LAB                                     118

A moan is heard. All three now converge on the area.
As they near it, Saavik's tricorder hums furiously. Be
this a room, a locker of some other place, this time
they -- "open the door." The limp bodies of Chekov and
Terrell fall out.

UHURA'S VOICE
(on screen)
Admiral Kirk, Enterprise. Come in,
please. Come in please.

She will continue sporadically.

KIRK
My God!

Chekov emits a live, reassuring moan.

BONES
That's Clark Terrell, Jim, I've
served with him.

Bones is passing his medical tricorder over Chekov.

BONES
(continuing)
Brain disturbance. Appears to be
drug induced.

He reaches into his kit. He shoots Chekov moves off
to Terrell. Uhura, voice continues in the b.g.

KIRK
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her
we're all right.

119   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - FAVORING UHURA                    119

UHURA
I say again. This is Enterprise.
Please acknowledge signal. Please --

Saavik's face appears on her screen.

SAAVIK
(on screen, hurried)
Commander Uhura, this is Lt. Saavik.
We're all right. Please stand by.
Out.

UHURA
(baffled)
Aye, aye.

120   INT. SPACE STATION - TIGHT GROUP                           120

Chekov opens his eyes, and stares into Kirk's.

CHEKOV
Oh, God, Admiral...!

He weeps like a child, and Kirk holds him. Meanwhile,
Terrell opens his eyes and stares at Bones.

BONES
It's Dr. McCoy, Captain. Do you
remember me?

TERRELL
McCoy? Yes. Oh, yes.

121   ANGLE FAVORING CHEKOV AND KIRK                             121

Chekov breaks the embrace in high relief and anxiety.

CHEKOV
Oh, sir. It was Khan! We found him
on Ceti Alpha V.

KIRK
Easy, Pavel... Tell me what you
can...

CHEKOV
No life signs -- but he was there.
Captured us. He -- he put creatures
in our bodies. To control our minds.

Bones takes over Chekov --

BONES
It's all right, you're safe...

CHEKOV
... Made us say -- lies... Do...
things... But we beat him... The
Captain and me. -- He thought he
controlled us, but he didn't ...
The Captain was strong.

Chekov breaks into tears. Kirk looks at Terrell, who is
more composed.

KIRK
Captain. Where is Dr. Marcus?
Where are the Genesis materials?

TERRELL
He couldn't find them. Some of
the scientists were still here,
but everything else, even the data
banks -- were empty.

SAAVIK
That's true, Admiral. All the
memory cells have been emptied.

KIRK
(ponders)
Erased...

TERRELL
He tortured those people. None of
them would tell him anything. He
went wild, strung them up and slit
their throats. He wanted to tear
the place apart, but he was late:
he had to get back to Reliant in
time to blow you to bits.

KIRK
He came damn close...

CHEKOV
He left us.
(with irony)
We were no longer of use.
SAAVIK
Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?

TERRELL
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's
completely mad, Admiral. He blames
you for the death of his wife...

KIRK
I know what he blames me for.
(thinks)
The escape pods are all in place.
(looks around)
Where's the transporter room?

122   INT. SPACE STATION TRANSPORTER ROOM                        122

Kirk, wearing his spectacles, studies the transporter
consoles. ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL the transporter pods,
and the others, b.g.

KIRK
Did he make it down here?

Chekov and Terrell look at each other; they seem a bit
stronger.

CHEKOV
It was not my impression. He spent
most of his time trying to wring the
information out of the people.

Saavik approaches Kirk:

SAAVIK
Anything?

Kirk looks at her over the rims of the glasses:

KIRK
Somebody left the unit on. If
everyone else was dead, it implies
that no one remained to turn it off.
Those people back there bought escape
time for Genesis with their lives.

Saavik studies the console.

SAAVIK
It doesn't make sense. These
coordinates are well within
Regula -- a plantoid we know to be
lifeless and airless.

KIRK
(wheels turn)
If Stage Two was completed, it was
underground -- she said it was going
to be underground.

SAAVIK
Stage Two of what?

Kirk gets it.

KIRK
(on communicator)
Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report,
Spock?

SPOCK'S VOICE
Admiral, if we go by the book, like
Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem
like days.

KIRK
(beat)
I read you, Captain. Let's have it.

Fractional pause.

SPOCK'S VOICE
The situation is grave, Admiral. We
won't have main power for six days
at least. Auxiliary power has
temporarily failed, but maybe we can
restore that in two days. By the
book, Admiral.

Kirk frowns.

KIRK
Meaning you can't even beam us back?

SPOCK'S VOICE
Not at present.

Kirk looks at Saavik and Bones, decides --

KIRK
Captain Spock, if you do not hear
from us within one hour your orders
are to restore what power you can,
take the Enterprise to the nearest
Star Base and alert Starfleet
command when you are out of jamming
range.

UHURA'S VOICE
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!

KIRK
Uhura, if you don't hear from us,
there won't be anybody behind. Kirk
out.
(to Terrell and Chekov)
You gentleman can remain here, or...

TERRELL
If it's all the same, Admiral, we'd
like to share the risk.

KIRK
(hesitates)
Very well. Let's go.

BONES
Go? Where are we going?

KIRK
(points to console)
Where they went. Saavik.

Kirk walks onto the pods as Saavik works the console,
rolling in electronic coding. The others join Kirk.

BONES
But what if they went -- nowhere?

KIRK
Then this will be your big chance
to get away from it all.

SAAVIK
Ready.

She presses a button, joins them on the pods. Slowly
they VANISH.

123   EXT. SPACE - THE PLANTOID REGULA                           123

CAMERA MOVES TOWARD it as the BEAM SOUND continues,
with irregularity. The plantoid is ugly and dead.
The sound frightens us, and climaxes with:

124   INT. ROCKY CAVERN - REGULA                                 124

The BEAM SOUND screeches, then settles into its comfort-
able mode as the FIVE FIGURES FLUCTUATE, FADE, then
APPEAR. They look around in wonder and relief.

SAAVIK
Admiral --

She indicates something O.S. They cross as CAMERA
reveals a cave wall stacked with technical materials
and crowned by a LARGE PROJECTILE, a giant version
of the model we saw earlier. They stare. (N.B. FEATURE
GENESIS ARMING CONTROL BOX.)

BONES
Genesis, I presume.

They walk by a group of crates. It all happens very
fast: David leaps out and tackles Kirk, throwing him to
the ground and landing atop him, a knife at his throat.

At the same time, Bones and Saavik reach for their
phasers, but Jedda, already armed, steps out. He has
them covered and helpless.

125   ANGLE FAVORING DAVID                                       125

DAVID
You're the sonavabitch who
committed mass murder up there.

He raises the knife --

KIRK
I'm Admiral Kirk...

DAVID
We were still there, you dumb
bastard! We could hear the screams
all the way to the transporter room --

Again he raises the knife --

KIRK
Where's Dr. Marcus --

DAVID
I'm Doctor Marcus!

Carol reaches the tunnel entrance to the cave --

CAROL
David --

DAVID
Mother, go back!

Carol sees Kirk --

CAROL
Jim --

DAVID
Go back. I'm going to kill him.

CAROL
(takes a breath)
You do that and you'll have murdered
your father.

All react. David and Kirk, facing each other, are
turned to stone. Bones, Jedda and Chekov turn to look
at Carol, wondering. Terrell very casually takes the
phaser from Jedda.

126   NEW ANGLE (FORMERLY SCENE 134)                             126

TERRELL
(cool)
I'll hold onto this.

But Kirk and Carol ignore them and walk towards each
other. There are tears in Carol's eyes. She reaches
up, trying to smile and touches his hair --

CAROL
You've got a little grey --

She can't. Kirk takes her and holds her tightly, look-
ing at David, over her shoulder. He stands there,
stunned, looking back.

KIRK
Carol. Is that true?

She nods --

KIRK
(continuing)
Why didn't you tell me?

DAVID
She's making it up! My father was
Professor --

CAROL
David, you're just making this
harder --

TERRELL
I'm afraid it's even harder than you
think, Doctor.

He and Chekov have their phasers trained on them.

TERRELL
(continuing)
Please don't move --

KIRK
Chekov -- !

CHEKOV
I'm sorry, Admiral.

Terrell speaks into his wrist recorder.

TERRELL
Your excellency, have you been
listening?

KHAN'S VOICE
(filtered)
I have indeed, Captain. You have
done well...

DAVID
I knew it -- !

David makes a reckless break for Terrell; Saavik
instantly throws herself on him bringing him down as
Terrell fires, hitting Jedda, who was behind David --
a killing ray. Jedda dematerializes. Carol SCREAMS
and David reacts with horror and guilt.

Most importantly, Chekov begins to tremble. Terrell
himself is shaken by his reflexive action. He's in
semi-panic.

TERRELL
Don't move -- any of you!

127                                                              127

136   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE - FAVORING KHAN                        136

Joachim over his shoulder. Others in evidence. Khan
speaks into his console.

KHAN
Captain... We're waiting. What's
the delay?

137   INT. ROCKY CAVERN (INTERCUT AS DESIRED)                    137

TERRELL
All is well, sir. You have the
coordinates to beam up Genesis...

KHAN
First things first, Captain. Kill
Admiral Kirk.

Reactions by all -- only Kirk and Bones are unsurprised.
David and Saavik, dazed, fight the urge to do something.
Chekov is close to a seizure. Terrell fights conflicting
mental signals.

TERRELL
Excellency... it is difficult.
I try to obey, but --

KHAN'S VOICE
Kill him.

As though tearing off a leach, Terrell grabs at the
wrist recorder and flings it to the ground. A shock-
wave of pain hits Terrell. He recovers, trembling and
tries to obey. Chekov is shaking badly. Terrell aims
his phaser at Kirk. Chekov slowly raises his phaser
and aims at Terrell, though his hands are like lead.
We THINK Chekov is going to do the right thing. Then,
shockingly: Terrell turns his phaser on himself.

KHAN'S VOICE
(still emanates from
wrist recorder)
Kill him, Terrell. Now.

Terrell does, blowing himself into oblivion.

138   ANGLE - FAVORING CHEKOV                                    138

He SCREAMS, horribly, drops his phaser, clutching his
head.

Bones leaps to his side, pulls an injection device from
his belt pack, jabs it into Chekov's arm. Chekov,
almost with a sigh of relief, drops.

KHAN'S VOICE
Terrell? Chekov -- !

BONES
Jim -- for God's sake!

They rush to his side, as do Carol and David.

139   ANGLE - FAVORING CHEKOV                                    139

From the fallen man's ear, something begins to emerge.

140   VERY CLOSE - CHEKOV'S EAR                                  140

The Ceti eel crawls out. It has grown quite large.

141   SCENE                                                      141

Horror from all. Kirk picks up a phaser. As the eel
clears Chekov, he fires and destroys it. He shudders,
then sees the wrist recorder and grabs it.

KIRK
Khan, you bloodsucker, they're
finished! You'll have to do your
own dirty work now. Do you hear me?
Do you?

142   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE                                        142

Khan reacts to Kirk's VOICE: electronic shock. He
clutches the communicator, his eye-whites rolling.

KHAN
Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive --
my old friend...

INTERCUT AS DESIRED WITH

143   ROCKY CAVERN - FAVORING KIRK                               143

KIRK
Still, 'old friend.' You've
managed to kill just about everyone
else, but like a poor marksman, you
keep missing the target.

KHAN
(ironic)
Perhaps I no longer need to try.

He punches several buttons.

In the Rocky Cavern the transporter beam locks on to the
Genesis torpedo and its arming control box.

As Kirk and the others watch, horrified, Khan beams up
the materials. David tries to reach the torpedo, but
Saavik holds him fast --

DAVID
Let go -- he can't -- !

SAAVIK
Only half of you would get there.

The beam disappears and Genesis with it, leaving them
alone.

KIRK
(desperate)
Khan, you have Genesis, but you
don't have me! You were going to
kill me, Khan, it was your sole
purpose. You'll have to come down
here to do it! You'll have to
come down!

KHAN'S VOICE
I've done far worse than kill you,
Admiral. I've hurt you. And I
wish to go on hurting you. I
shall leave you, as you left me --
where no one will ever find you:
poetic justice; marooned for
eternity in the center of a dead
planet -- buried alive.

KIRK
Khan -- !

KHAN
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't
count on Enterprise. She can't
move. My next act will be to blow
her out of the heavens.

KIRK
KHAN!

Khan closes his eyes in voluptuous satisfaction.
Joachim enters and Khan looks at him.

KHAN
Well?

JOACHIM
Warp drive still inoperative. All
other systems should be restored
shortly.

Khan sighs, contentedly.

KHAN
Excellent. We have all the time
in the world.

146   INT. ROCKY CAVERN                                          146

As before, Saavik is on the communicator.

SAAVIK
This is Lt. Saavik, calling Enterprise...

She keeps trying. Chekov stirs --

BONES
He's alive!

Bones goes and tends Chekov who moans, tries to sit up.

KIRK
Pavel?

Chekov tries to smile; Kirk takes his hand --

SAAVIK
No use, Admiral, they're still
jamming all channels.

BONES
(looks across Chekov)
It wouldn't make any difference.
If Enterprise obeyed orders she's
long since gone. And if she couldn't
obey, she's finished.

DAVID
So are we, it looks like.

CAROL
I don't understand.
Who's responsible for all this?
Who is Khan?

KIRK
It's a long story.

DAVID
We appear to have plenty of time.

BONES
(dry)
You and your father can catch up on
things.

DAVID
(bitter)
My father. I hope you realize
another man has just been killed
because of...

BONES
Because of you, son. You shouldn't
have tried to rush someone holding
a primed phaser. Anyway it isn't
one man dead, it's two, in case
you've lost count.

David has been effectively spiked. Long silence.

KIRK
Do you have anything to eat? I
don't know about anyone else, but
I'm starved.

BONES
How can you think of food at a time
like this?

KIRK
Our first order of business is survival.

CAROL
There's food in the Genesis cave,
enough to last a lifetime -- should
that be necessary.

BONES
We thought this was Genesis.

Carol laughs -- there's an edge of hysteria to it.

CAROL
This? It took the Starfleet corps
of engineers ten months in space
suits to tunnel out all this. What
we did in there -- we did in a day.
David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy
and the Lieutenant our idea of food.

DAVID
But we can't just sit here -- !

KIRK
(unruffled)
Oh, yes we can. Is there really
something to eat?

David looks at his father, who checks his watch, putting
on his spectacles.

CAROL
David. Please.

DAVID
(to Kirk)
This is just to give us something
to do, isn't it?
(he shrugs)
Come on.

Saavik and Bones make to follow. Saavik turns to Kirk --

SAAVIK
Admiral?

KIRK
As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond
of saying: I like to think there
always are possibilities.

Carol sits on the ground, Chekov's head in her lap,
looking at Kirk.

CAROL
David was right, wasn't he? It's
just to keep them busy.

KIRK
Why? Why didn't you tell me?

CAROL
How can you ask me that? Were we
together? Where we going to be?
You had your world and I had mine.
I wanted him in mine, not chasing
through the universe with his father.

Kirk turns away, overcome. She watches him.

CAROL
(continuing)
He's a lot like you in many ways.
Nothing I could do about it. He's
smarter, of course; that goes without
saying. Most of Genesis is really
his.

Her joke doesn't take effect. He doesn't turn.

CAROL
(continuing)
This is it, isn't it? We're never
going to get out of here.

Kirk says nothing.

CAROL
(continuing)
Please. Tell me what you're feeling.

Kirk hesitates, comes back and sits next to Chekov; he
changes Bones' compress on the ear as he finally speaks.

KIRK
There's a man I haven't seen in
fifteen years who thinks he's killed
me. You show me a son who'd almost be
happy to help him. My son. My life
that could have been and wasn't. What
am I feeling? I'm feeling old --
worn out.

Carol studies him; gently she sets Chekov's head down
on a sweater, then stands.

CAROL
Let me show you something that will
make you feel young -- young as when
the world was new.

She offers her hand. Kirk looks at Chekov, who smiles,
faint assurance.

CAROL
(continuing)
He'll be all right. Come.

After a moment's hesitation, Kirk takes her hand and
she leads him to the tunnel.

150B   INT. TUNNEL                                               150B

TRUCKING BEFORE Carol and Kirk. A rising light falls
on their faces as they walk, then run with excitement
toward the source. Kirk races ahead...

150E   FULL SHOT - THE GENESIS CAVE (MATTE AND FX) (FORMERLY     150E
SCENE 130)

A huge cavern. Kirk is actually standing at the middle
of it. Space extends vastly above and below his point
of view. Like Eden, lush growth everywhere, water-
falls, and a cobalt blue sky high, high above where a
round orb glows sending light and warmth downward.
There is a path from where Kirk stands down to the lower
level where Bones, and the others are waiting and calling
to him. Mist and haze waft gently across the cavern.

Where IS she?

159   INT. GENESIS CAVE PLATFORM                                 159

Kirk and the others eat fruit from the huge (matte)
forest beyond. Chekov has been moved to join them.

159A   ANGLE FAVORING DAVID AND SAAVIK                           159A

who watches him.

DAVID
What are you looking at?

SAAVIK
The Admiral's son.

DAVID
Don't you believe it.

SAAVIK
Oh, I believe it.

She almost smiles. David returns her stare and it
throws her.

SAAVIK
(continuing)
What are you looking at?

DAVID
(confused)
I don't know.

159B   INT. GENESIS CAVE - WIDER ANGLE                           159B

Saavik rises, paces. Kirk puts down his food.

KIRK
Now that's what I call a meal.

BONES
It's like the Garden of Eden...

CAROL
Only here, every apple comes from
the Tree of Knowledge.

Kirk watches Saavik.

KIRK
What's on your mind, Lieutenant?

SAAVIK
The Kobayashi Maru, sir.

DAVID
The what?

BONES
The no-win scenario -- and with
what philosophy a commander faces
defeat.

KIRK
Are you asking me if we are playing
out that scenario now, Lieutenant?

SAAVIK
On the test, sir, will you tell me
what you did? I'd really like to
know.

Kirk looks at Bones, who smiles --

BONES
Lieutenant, you are looking at the
only Starfleet cadet who ever beat
the no-win scenario --

KIRK
And almost got tossed out of the
Academy...

He looks at his watch again, using his glasses --

SAAVIK
How?

KIRK
I reprogrammed the simulation so it
was possible to rescue the ship.

SAAVIK
WHAT?

KIRK
I changed the conditions of the
test. I received a commendation for
original thinking.
(pause)
I don't like to lose.

SAAVIK
Then -- you never faced that
situation -- faced death...

BONES
Until now.

KIRK
We each face death every day we're
alive, Saavik.

He picks up the communicator.

KIRK
(continuing)
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours.
Are you about ready?

SPOCK'S VOICE
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just
give us your coordinates and we'll
beam you aboard.

The others are on their feet, stunned with amazement --

KIRK
Right. I don't like to lose.

He clicks off.

David gapes at his father.

161   EXT. SPACE DARK SIDE OF REGULA                             161

WE CAN SEE NOW where Enterprise is: she has slipped
behind the plantoid, clockwise, even as Reliant was
rounding into the lighted side.

162   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - ENTERPRISE                         162

Kirk, David, Saavik, Carol and Bones, holding the semi-
conscious Chekov MATERIALIZE. Spock is there to greet
them.

SAAVIK
But the damage report -- we were
immobilized...

KIRK
Come, come, Lieutenant, you of all
people go by the book. Hello,
Spock. You remember Dr. Marcus...

They are moving through the room as they talk --

SPOCK
Certainly...

SAAVIK
(overlapping)
By the book...

KIRK
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions
are being monitored during battle...'

SAAVIK
'... no uncoded messages on an open
channel...'

Saavik steps in front of Spock.

SAAVIK
(continuing)
You lied.

SPOCK
I exaggerated.

KIRK
Hours instead of days, Saavik; now
we have minutes instead of hours --

BONES
(behind)
I'm taking this bunch to sick bay.

CAMERA STAYS WITH THEM, HOLDS ON DAVID, awed.

163   INT. CORRIDOR ENTERPRISE                                   163

Saavik and Kirk follow Spock. They stop at a Turbo
Lift --

SPOCK
They're inoperative below C-deck.

164   INT. ANOTHER ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR                           164

They race down corridors as they speak --

KIRK
What IS working around here?

SPOCK
Not much, Admiral. We have partial
main power...

KIRK
That's it?

SPOCK
Best we could do in two hours.

165   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     165

Admiral on the bridge --

KIRK
Battle stations.

ALARMS, SIRENS, ETC. CREW RUSH INTO PLACE AS Kirk,
Spock and Saavik approach the big screen.

KIRK
(continuing)
Tactical.

We see the Enterprise emerging from the dark side of
Gamma Regula, where Reliant is now a moving blip.

KIRK
(continuing)
Uh oh.

SPOCK
She can out-run us and out-gun us.
But there is the Mutara Nebula at
153 mark four.

KIRK
(studies his console)
Scotty, can we make it inside?

SCOTTY
The energizer's bypassed like a
Christmas tree -- so don't give me
too many bumps.

KIRK
No promises, Mr. Scott. On your way.

SAAVIK
Trouble with the nebula, sir, is all
that static discharge and gas clouds
our tactical display. Visuals won't
function and shields will be useless.

Kirk looks over the rims of his glasses at Spock; they
smile with faint amusement.

SPOCK
What's sauce for the goose, Mr.
Saavik. The odds will be even.

166   VARIOUS CORRIDORS, ENTERPRISE                              166

Carol, David and Bones react to the light change and
the sirens -- Bones works on Chekov...

DAVID
I'm going up there.

BONES
You'll be in the way, Dr. Marcus...
best stay here.

Carol and David are civilians on a battleship.

168   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     168

Reacting. Saavik approaches Kirk and Spock.

SAAVIK
Admiral... what happens if Reliant
fails to follow us into the nebula?

Kirk and Spock exchange looks --

SPOCK
I think we can guarantee she'll
follow us, Mr. Saavik. Remind me
to explain to you the concept of
human ego.

KIRK
Best speed, Scotty...

169   EXT. SPACE                                                 169

The Enterprise whooshes by CAMERA leaving Regula
behind. Reliant now appears in far b.g. and CAMERA
BEGINS A MOVE to her.

170   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE                                        170

-- so much the better...

171   EXT. SPACE                                                 171

Reliant moves to and past CAMERA in hot pursuit.

172   EXT. SPACE - SERIES OF SHOTS                               172

Call them SPACE-BYS. Enterprise rushes TOWARD US,
flashes BY and CONTINUES towards the swirling nebula.

THEN Reliant does the same, closer in pursuit. At
this moment, half the distance between Regula and
the nebula has been covered.

The ship reverberates with the near miss. Chekov wakes
up, looks wildly about --

BONES
Take it easy --

CHEKOV
But I must --

BONES
Listen to me, Pavel; you haven't
the strength or the equilibrium --

CHEKOV
But --

As they talk, David, unnoticed, leaves the area. The
Enterprise is buffeted again --

CAROL
Dr. McCoy, I can't just sit here.
Tell me what I can do.

BONES
(grim)
You can help get my surgery squared
away. I'm expecting customers.

She whitens in fear. ANOTHER SHOT reverberates.

179   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     179

SAAVIK
That was close --

KIRK
(unfazed)
They just don't want us going in there.

SPOCK
One minute to nebula perimeter.

The bridge door slides open and David enters. He
stares in wonder. Saavik reacts to David.

SPOCK
(continuing)
Admiral, they're reducing speed.

KIRK
Uhura, patch me in --

UHURA
Aye, sir.

180   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE                                        180

KHAN
Why are we slowing?

JOACHIM
We daren't follow them into the
nebula, sir -- our shields will be
useless...

KIRK'S VOICE
This is Admiral Kirk.

Khan's eyes bulge --

KIRK'S VOICE
(continuing)
We tried it once your way, Khan.
Are you game for a rematch?

Khan's eyes bulge --

KIRK'S VOICE
(continuing)
Khan -- ! I'm laughing at the
"superior" intellect.

KHAN
Full impulse power!

JOACHIM
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever
you want --

KHAN
Full power damn you!

And he reaches across and executes it himself.

181   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     181

KIRK

I'll say this for him: he's
consistent.

182   EXT. SPACE - THE MUTARA NEBULA                             182

WE'RE VERY CLOSE NOW, and SEE CLEARLY the swirling,
slowly moving gases, magenta, purple, etc. There are
veils of luminescent materials and through all an
interlace of unpredictable electrical charges.

Like lightning, these intermittent great flashes
illumine whole sections of the nebula. OUR VIEW is
moving slowly forward...

183   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     183

As Enterprise whooshes into the PICTURE headed into the
purplish gas -- and disappears into a cloud bank of
the stuff.

A moment then Reliant APPEARS, pursues Enterprise into
the gloom, also disappears.

185   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE                                        185

ON SCREEN the picture is squirrelly purple, breaking
up. Blindness. Panic.

KHAN
Tactical!

JOACHIM
(tries)
Inoperative.

KHAN
Raise the shields...

Electrical forces raging without are also reflected on
the circuits within. It's bumpy, on top of everything
else. Electronic WHINING.

JOACHIM
As I feared, sir. Not functional.
I'm reducing speed.

Khan does not argue.

186   EXT. SPACE - PURPLE - SERIES OF SHOTS                      186

Cautiously Reliant emerges from a massive "cloudbank."
Electrical discharges abound. Barely moving, she feels
her way forward. Alone.

187   AS THE ANGLE WIDENS                                        187

A treat: Enterprise is above and behind Reliant.

188   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - ON SCREEN                         188

Reliant's image is breaking up.

SULU
Phaser lock inoperative, sir.

KIRK
Best guess, Mr. Sulu. Fire when
ready.

Sulu strains, then fires -- just as an electrical dis-
turbance bounces the bridge --

189   EXT. SPACE NEBULA                                          189

The bounce causes Sulu's phaser shot to go wide of
Reliant, amid CRACKLING discharges --

190   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE                                        190

191   EXT. SPACE NEBULA                                          191

Reliant is wide of the mark with a Photon torpedo.
A BLINDING ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE. When it clears,
Enterprise appears to be alone.

192   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     192

Hold your course. Look sharp...

SAAVIK

SUDDEN GLIMPSE: Reliant boring in on collision course!

196   INT. ENTERPRSIE BRIDGE                                     196

A sudden clearing ON SCREEN: Reliant!

KIRK
Evasive starboard!

Hard over, but not fast enough. Reliant fires a phaser.

197   SERIES OF SHOTS                                            197

Reliant's phaser shot hits the Enterprise torpedo room
in Dorsal Fin area of ship.

198   INT. ENTERPRISE TORPEDO ROOM                               198

An EXPLOSION rocks the room and...

199   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     199

The Bridge rattles from the explosion below; Sulu is
thrown from his chair. Saavik leaps to her post --

KIRK
Phaser bank one, fire!

200   EXT. SPACE NEBULA        200

The Enterprise fires a phaser and delivers a raking shot
-- which rips along the side of Reliant's primary hull.

200A   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE (FORMERLY SCENE 205)                 200A

The bridge is damaged; Joachim and others are wounded...

KHAN
Joachim!

For the first time, his friend wounded, Khan hesitates,
holds him --

JOACHIM
Yours... is... the superior...

KHAN
I shall avenge you --

200B   NEW ANGLE                                                 200B

into a deep purple mass.

201   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     201

202   INT. ENGINE ROOM                                           202

Bones is there, helping some crewmen. The Reactor Room
flashes a red warning light and glows with a blue
light. The air is heavy with smoke but the doors,
damaged earlier, still hold.

SCOTTY
Admiral, I've got to take the mains
off the line. The energizer's shaken
loose and I can't get in there to
fix her -- radiation --

203   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     203

KIRK
All right, we'll do the job with
auxiliary power.

The bridge door opens and closes; Chekov, faint,
stands there.

CHEKOV
Could you use another hand, Admiral?

KIRK
Man the weapons console, Mr. Chekov.

ANGLE FAVORING David as the others react to Chekov
taking his place. Quiet.

KIRK
(continuing)
Spock?

Spock is bent over the scanner --

SPOCK
Sporadic energy readings port side,
aft. Could be an impulse turn.

KIRK
He won't break off now. If he
followed me this far he'll be back.
But from where...?

SPOCK
He's intelligent, but not experienced.
His pattern indicates two dimensional
thinking...

Kirk looks at him, smiles.

KIRK
Mr. Saavik, all stop.

SAAVIK
All stop, sir.

KIRK
Descend ten thousand meters. Stand
by photon torpedoes.

204   EXT. SPACE NEBULA                                          204

almost tranquil place. Reliant, moving slowly, stops,
as if looking around.

207   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE                                        207

Reliant motionless in the f.g. amid occasional flashes.
Now, behind Reliant and from below, like a great whale
rising from the depths, Enterprise rises vertically,
slowly passing the unsuspecting enemy. When Enterprise
is above, behind and quite close:

209   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     209

Reliant ON SCREEN, intermittent but clear.

CHEKOV

Reliant, now a scarred, battered hulk, her main hull
still intact, but dead in space.

212   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     212

No cheers, just deadly professionalism.

KIRK
Cease fire. Look sharp.

SAAVIK
Power levels quite low, sir.

KIRK
(to intercom)
Mr. Scott, can you get the mains
back on line?

SCOTTY'S VOICE
(breaking up slightly)
I'll need ten minutes, sir, 'til
the radiation dissipates.

KIRK
Uhura, send to Commander, Reliant:
prepare to be boarded.

UHURA
Aye, sir.

213   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE                                        213

Amid the smoke and ruins, WE SEE no signs of life.

UHURA'S VOICE
Commander, Reliant, this is
Enterprise. Surrender and prepare
to be boarded. Repeat...

In f.g., chillingly, Khan rises INTO SHOT by the main
console. He is horribly burned, and it is clear that
he is clinging to life by his will.

KHAN
No... Kirk. The game's not over.

As Uhura's voice continues O.S., Khan pulls himself
into a chair at the console, one of his hands useless
at his side.

KHAN
(continuing)
To the last I will grapple with thee!

Painfully, with one good arm, he starts arming the
Genesis console.

213A   INT. RELIANT TRANSPORTER ROOM                             213A

There sits the Genesis torpedo: lights start blinking
in response. As we watch, the CHILD we met on Ceti Alpha
walks to the torpedo and smiles at the lights.

214   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     214

UHURA
Enterprise to Reliant: you are
ordered to surrender your vessel.
Respond!
(to Kirk)
Nothing, sir.

KIRK
We'll beam aboard. Alert
transporter room --

SPOCK
Admiral. Scanning an energy source
on Reliant. A pattern I've never
seen.

David peers closer over Spock's shoulder, reacts.

DAVID
It's the Genesis Wave!

KIRK
What?

DAVID
He's on a build up to detonation!

KIRK
How soon --

DAVID
We encoded four minutes --

KIRK
We'll beam aboard and stop it --

DAVID
You can't!

The briefest stunned moment. Kirk hits intercom:

KIRK
Scotty, I need warp speed in three
minutes or we're all dead!

STATIC.

KIRK
(continuing)
Scotty!

Spock leaps from his place and disappears through the
bridge doors.

KIRK
(continuing)
Saavik, get us out, best speed!

SAAVIK
Aye, sir.

215   EXT. SPACE NEBULA                                          215

Enterprise backs away from Reliant. Her speed is pain-
fully slow.

216   INT. RELIANT BRIDGE                                        216

ON SCREEN, Enterprise, intermittent image, backs away.
Khan smiles triumphantly through his pain. An elec-
tronic power SOUND has been building.

KHAN
No... You can't get away... From
hell's heart I stab at thee...
(amid the pain)
For hate's sake... I spit my last
breath at thee!

Khan topples forward, dead. The WHINE continues to
build chillingly.

217   INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM                                217

Spock rushes in. Bones ministers to Scotty, b.g.

Spock sizes up the situation, starts for the radiation
room, Bones intercepts him.

BONES
Are you out of your Vulcan mind?
No human can tolerate the radiation
loose in there!

SPOCK
But, as you are so fond of observing,
Doctor, I'm not human.

BONES
You're not going in there -- !

SPOCK
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss
this logically --

He gives Bones the Vulcan nerve pinch. Bones goes
down.

Spock presses the access button and enters the Reactor
Room, a separated area behind radiation-proof glass
and metal, RED FLASHING LIGHTS and an iridescent blue
glow within.

218   ANGLE - SCOTTY AND BONES                                   218

SCOTTY
(in horror)
Spock -- get out of there!

219   INT. ENTERPRISE REACTOR ROOM                               219

Bathed in blue light, arcing energy around him, Spock
is a silhouetted figure as he goes to work, door clos-
ing behind him.

220   EXT. SPACE - RELIANT                                       220

danger...

221   EXT. SPACE NEBULA - ENTERPRISE                             221

A snail's pace compared to the escape speed needed.

222   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     222

KIRK
Time from my mark...

SAAVIK
Two minutes, ten seconds.

KIRK

Engine room! What's happening?!

223   INT. ENTERPRISE REACTOR ROOM (INTERCUT AS                  223
REQUIRED)

Outside the glass, Scotty and Bones screaming:

SCOTTY
Captain, please!

BONES
Get out! Get out, man! Oh, dear
God...!

224   WITHIN                                                     224

WE CAN SEE the silent urging of Bones and Scotty.
Spock is oblivious. Amid the fire-blue arcs, he moves
to the control panel. Between his hands and the con-
trols, power arcs insanely. Spock is in an inferno,
a radiation hell, fighting now with all his strength
to control it. Slowly, the damping rods move out.
Spock moves to a manual control, begins to turn it.

225   CLOSE - SPOCK'S HANDS                                      225

226   HIS FACE                                                   226

His face, using all the self discipline he is capable
of to control the pain, continuing to work --

227   WITHOUT                                                    227

Bones and Scotty react in helpless horror.

228   EXT. SPACE NEBULA                                          228

Enterprise still well within the nebula, Reliant a
figure still visible in b.g. She's crawling still.

229   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     229

Reliant, now symbol of death, ON SCREEN.

KIRK
Time!

SAAVIK
Three minutes, thirty seconds.

KIRK
Distance from Reliant...

CHEKOV
Four hundred kilometers.

Kirk looks at David, but David shakes his head: No
way. Then:

CADET
Sir! The mains are back on line -- !

KIRK
Bless you, Scotty. Go, Saavik!

She increases power and --

F)   EXT. MUTARA NEBULA - MASTER EFFECT

As Reliant goes, so goes the nebula. The "Genesis
Effect" WE SAW in its earliest experiments, now
seems familiar on a gigantic, cosmic scale.

The blinding flash at first, followed by the same
tumbling turbulence of the miniature test. It is
awesome.

231   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     231

The bridge doors open and Carol appears. Instinctively
she draws near her son.

Finally, Kirk turns, sees Carol --

KIRK
Reduce speed. My God, Carl. Look
at it.

ON SCREEN and INTERCUT -- GENESIS TUMBLES and starts
evolving. A moment in history.

KIRK
(continuing, on
intercom)
Engine Room. Well done. Scotty?

BONES' VOICE
(after a beat)
Jim, you'd better get down here. Hurry.

The tone frightens Kirk.

KIRK
Saavik, take the con.

He moves through the doors quickly, leaving the rest
staring at the new world evolving.

232   INT. STAIRWAY TO ENGINE ROOM                               232

It is endless. Kirk runs forever, feet pounding down,
down, down --

233   EXT. SPACE AND ON SCREEN                                   233

The clouds tumble and move, new things lie beyond --

234   INT. STAIRS                                                234

Kirk races --

235   INT. ENTERPRISE ENGINE ROOM                                235

Kirk emerges to encounter Scotty and Bones. Their
looks tell him. He sees the flashing light over the
Reactor Room. He dashes for the control panel. Bones
grabs him.

SCOTTY
No, sir! You'll flood the whole
compartment...!

KIRK
He'll die -- !

BONES
(also holds him)
He's dead already, Jim.

Kirk's eyes bulge.

KIRK
Oh, God.

236   ANGLE AT REACTOR ROOM GLASS DOOR                           236

With stunned understanding, Kirk stumbles to the door,
sees Spock on his knees, hands blackened, face cracked
with radiation lines and scars.

Spock shakes his head. With a feeble hand he reaches
the intercom button: filtered communication.

KIRK
Spock!

SPOCK
The ship -- out of danger?

KIRK
Yes --

Spock is satisfied; he fights for breath --

SPOCK
Don't grieve, Admiral -- it's
logical: the good of the many
outweighs --

He almost keels over. Kirk has tears streaming down
his face.

KIRK
... the good of the few...

SPOCK
Or the one.

He props a hand on the glass to support himself. Kirk's
hand reflexively goes to match Spock's on the other side
of the glass --

SPOCK
(continuing)
I never took the Kobayashi Maru
test -- until now. What do you
think of my solution?

KIRK
Spock...!

SPOCK
I have been -- and always will be
-- your friend... Live. Long. And.
Prosper.

Spock falls. Bones and Scotty react.

KIRK
No...!

SAAVIK'S VOICE
(intercom)
Admiral, you've got to see this!
There's new life -- a whole new
world, a Genesis world -- !

But Kirk is past hearing or caring. He is huddled up
against the glass, destroyed. Bones looks on, helpless.

DISSOLVE TO:

the Ship's Company in full dress uniforms assembled for
ship's burial service. Over the PULLBACK, we HEAR:

KIRK
In accordance with the traditions
of Starfleet and of Article 184
Starfleet Regulations, we are
assembled here today to pay final
respects to our honored dead.

Carol and David are PROMINENTLY FEATURED. David watching
Kirk attentively. So are Sulu, Uhura, Chekov, and Saavik.
Bones stands next to Kirk. Scotty carries his bagpipes.
Saavik wears her hair down.

KIRK
(continuing)
And yet, in the midst of our sorrow
it should be noted that this death
takes place in the shadow of new
life, the sunrise of a new world,
a world that our beloved comrade
gave his own life to protect and
nourish. He did not feel that
sacrifice a vain or empty one --
and we will not debate his profound
wisdom, in these proceedings. Of
my friend, I can only say this, that
of all the souls I have encountered
in my travels, his was the most --
(he falters)
-- human.

He tries to go on, but catches Bones' face: Bones is
streaming tears. Kirk can't go on.

KIRK
(continuing)
Lieutenant Saavik.

Saavik steps forward.

SAAVIK
We commend the soul of our brother
departed. We love we commit his
body to the depths of space.

SULU
Honors -- hup!

All Starfleet personnel salute. Scotty begins to PIPE,
an odd blare which mellows into Amazing Grace. Kirk
nods a signal.

SULU
Return -- hup!

The salute drop.

KIRK
Lieutenant.

She steps to him and they exchange salutes --

KIRK
(continuing; very
quietly)
After you dismiss the company, you
will take the watch. Set course
for Ceti Alpha V and we'll pick up
survivors.

SAAVIK
Aye, sir.

KIRK
I'll be in my quarters if needed,
but I would prefer...

SAAVIK
Understood, sir.

KIRK
(aloud)
Dismiss the company.

They salute. She about-faces as Kirk walks towards
the  Turbo Lift. Saavik issues dismissal and posting
orders, but WE TRUCK with Kirk until CAMERA STOPS and
he leaves FRAME and WE HOLD on David. He finally
understands.

245   INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS                                       245

After a long moment, the CAMERA DISCOVERS Kirk. He
pours a drink, then decides not to have it.

He sits wearily, not knowing how to shake the ghosts.
Then he sees the book.

Kirk picks up the battered volume, the gift from his
friend, and closes his eyes a moment. Almost idly
he starts turning pages, looking for a clue. But he
can't see the writing -- he rummages through his
pockets and pulls out the half-glasses --

One of the lenses is broken. It has a deep impact on
Kirk. He puts down the book and glasses and covers
his eyes.

A SOFT BONG. Kirk clears his throat.

KIRK
Yes... come.

The door whooshes open and closes to admit David. The
last person Kirk expected to see.

DAVID
I don't mean to intrude.

KIRK
Uh, no...
(rises)
I should be on the bridge.

DAVID
Are you running away from me?

David's strength is turning a corner with Kirk --

KIRK
I suppose I was.
(pause)
I poured a drink. Would you like
it?

DAVID
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you
expected.

KIRK
(rueful)
I didn't expect anything.

DAVID
That makes two of us.
(he studies his
father)
Lieutenant Saavik was right: you
never have faced death --

KIRK
(hoarse)
Not like this -- no. I haven't faced
death, I cheated death. I tricked
my way out of death and patted myself
on the back for my ingenuity. I
know nothing.

DAVID
You knew enough to tell Saavik that
how we face death is at least as
important as how we face life --

KIRK
It was just words.

DAVID
But good words. That's where ideas
begin. Maybe you should listen to
them.

KIRK
I'm trying, David.

DAVID
So am I. My friends were killed,
too.

KIRK
I am truly sorry.

Pause. They study each other.

DAVID
I was wrong about you. And I'm
sorry.

KIRK
Is that what you came here to say?

DAVID
Mainly.
(he starts out,
then turns -- )
And also that I'm proud -- very
proud -- to be your son.

A stunned moment, then Kirk lets it all hang out: for
David, for Carol and for Spock. He hugs his son, hold-
ing onto him as if to life itself.

246   EXT. SPACE                                                 246

247   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     247

The door whooshes. Kirk strides on the bridge, David
with him. Carol is there with Bones; they are glad at
what they see.

SAAVIK
Admiral on the bridge!

KIRK
As you were, Mr. Saavik.

SAAVIK
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha.
All is well.

KIRK
Good, I believe you already know
my, uh, son --

Saavik comes close to blushing --

KIRK
(continuing)
Yes, well, why don't you show him
around and...

SAAVIK
Aye, sir --

She takes him off, deadpan amusement --

SAAVIK
(continuing)
So you turn out to be the dumb
bastard.

They stare at her.

SAAVIK
(continuing)
That is a little joke.

Kirk has a smile. He joins Bones and Carol facing the
screen.

BONES
She's changed her hair again.
(pause)
Will you look at that? Think
they'll name it for you, Doctor?

CAROL
Not if I can help it. We'll name
it for our friend.

KIRK
(quietly)
It is a far far better thing I do
than I have ever done before... a
far better resting place I go to
than I have ever known...

CAROL
(soft)
Is that a poem?

KIRK
Something Spock was trying to
tell me. On my birthday.

He shakes his head, remembering --

BONES
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?

KIRK
(considers; smiles)
Young. I feel young, Doctor.

He turns to Saavik and David --

KIRK
(continuing)
Lieutenant, new course: 'Second
star to the right and straight on
till morning.'

The bridge crackles with lights and CHATTER as we...

OPENING CREDITS


INT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

We hear the rhythm of funky seventies SOUL MUSIC.

Then SHE steps into FRAME.

She is JACKIE BROWN, a stewardess dressed in her CABO AIR
uniform. (A little shuttle airline that flies from Los
Angeles to Cabo San Lucas. Approximate flight time: forty
five minutes)

Jackie stands still as a people-mover slowly inches her
through the airport. The CREDITS APEAR and DISAPPEAR in
front of her.

Jackie Brown is a very attractive black woman in her mid
forties, though she looks like she's in her mid-thirties.

The people-mover reaches the end of the line, she steps
off.

She breezes through Customs and we follow her with a
STEDICAM as she strides through the airport... She gets
to her gate disappears inside the plane for a moment
comes back out sans flight bag picks up the microphone.

JACKIE

EXT. FIRING RANGE - DAY

VIDEO

A chorus line of six beautiful bikini-clad women, all
holding different automatic weapons, BLASTING away.

The cheap VIDEO TITLES to:

"CHICKS WHO LOVE GUNS"

Play over this image.

One bikini beauty is singled out. She's a gorgeous
brunette named SIDNEY. Sidney stands facing camera
holding a TEC-9 and describing it.

SIDNEY
(to camera)
Hi, I'm Sidney. And I love to TEC-9.
The popular TEC-9 is advertised by
its makers as being tough as the
toughest customer.

SIDNEY'S STATISTICS: Age, height, measurements, date of
birth, appear at the bottom left-hand corner. As Sidney
continues her sales pitch demonstration, a BLACK MAN'S
VOICE begins talking over the video.

BLACK MAN (O.S.)
That's a TEC-9. It's a cheap ass
spray gun outta South Miami.

After a CLOSEUP of the TEC-9, Sidney FIRES the weapon.

BLACK VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Cost three-eighty retail. I get them
for two hundred and sell 'em for
eight.


INT. MELANIE'S BEAHC APARTMENT - NIGHT

The Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL
ROBBIE.

Ordell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes.
Stylish, athletic wear (Reebok), heavy, black leather
jackets (Hugo Boss), warm-colored berets and baseball
caps to cover his balding head are Ordell's "look." At
this moment Ordell's wearing an open silk shirt.

Ordell narrates the video playing on the big-screen V.
(the most expensive thing in the apartment). He holds a
cocktail in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice)
and the remote control in the other, pacing the floor in
his I-can-talk-anybody-into-anything voice.

LOUIS GARA, who looks like he does his shopping at the
Salvation Army (dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and
dungarees), sits on the sofa staring blankly at the
video, drinking Jack Daniels on ice. Louis, white, also
in his mid forties, has lived over half of his life in
penal institutions. The experience has affected both his
body language and his thought process.

While acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a
correction facility, in the real world his timing is
thrown. It's like a song he doesn't know the lyrics to
but attempt to sing anyway.

The third person watching the video is the person who
lives in this apartment, MELANIE RALSTON. Melanie, thirty-
three, is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like
the kind you se in the old Crown International movies
from the seventies like "Pom Pom Girls" "Malibu Beach"
and "Beach Girls," except Melanie is older than any of
those girls ever are. She's dressed in her Melanie-
uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top.
So far Melanie has been able to make a living out of
lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man
more than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs.
In her prime (twenty two) it was Japanese industrialists,
film production guys, and Middle Eastern businessmen who
kept Melanie. And it was places like the Bahamas,
Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept her.

But now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in
Hermosa Beach, California that Ordell pays for an drops
in and out of. She's curled up in a reclining chair,
smoking weed from a pipe, reading Movieline Magazine and
paying no attention to the video.

ORDELL
This TEC-9? They advertise it as
being the most popular gun in
American crime. Can you believe that
shit? It actually says that on the
little booklet that comes with it.
"Most Popular Gun in American Crime,"
like they're proud of that shit.

Ordell hits the fast-forward on his remote control.

Sidney is rushed off the screen and replace by CINDY, a
pretty, blonde bodybuilder clad in a red, white and blue
bikini, holding a Styer Aug.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Check out this body-builder chick...
Now see what she got. That's a Styer
aug. Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker.
Listen.

Ordell punches up the volume.

Cindy BLASTS the Styer Aug, loud.

Ordell imitates the sound of the weapon.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Shit's expensive, man. Comes from
Austria. My customers don't know shit
about it, so there ain't no demand.
(to Melanie)
Baby, I could use some more ice.

Melanie puts down the magazine, takes his cocktail glass
from him and moves to the kitchen.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
But put that bad boy in a flick,
every motherfucker out there want
one. I'm serious as a heart attack.
Them Hong Kong movies came out, every
nigga gotta have a forty-five. And
they don't want one, they want two,
cause nigga want to be "The Killer."
What they don't know, and that movie
don't tell you is a .45 has a serious
fuckin' jammin' problem. I always try
and steer a customer towards a 9-
millimeter. Damn near the same
weapon, don't have half the jammin'
problems. But some niggas out there,
you can't tell them anything. They
want a .45. The killer had a .45,
they want a .45.

Melanie comes back, hands Ordell his screwdriver, then
sits where she was.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Thanks, Baby.

LOUIS
Who's your partner?

Ordell sits down on the couch. Melanie's reading
"Movieline Inside" magazine.

ORDELL
Mr. Walker. He runs a fishing boat in
Mexico. I deliver the merchandise to
him, gets it to my customers. On all
my bulk sales, anyway. Nigga didn't
have a pot to piss in or a window to
throw it out 'fore I set 'em up. Now,
motherfucker's rollin' in cash. He
got himself a yacht, with all kinds
of high tech navigational shit on it.
(back to video)
AK-47, the very best there is.

GLORIA, a tall, Amazonian, bikini-clad, black woman faces
camera and describes the AK-47.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
When you absolutely, positively,
gotta kill every motherfucker in the
room, accept no substitute. That
there is the Chinese one. I pay eight-
fifty and double my money.

The phone rings.

ORDELL(CONT'D)
Get that for me, will ya baby?

MELANIE
You know it's for you.

Ordell just stares at her.

ORDELL
Girl, you better not make me go over
there and put my feet to ya.

Louis keeps staring at he screen.

Melanie gets up, goes over to the counter that separates
the living room from the kitchen, picks up the phone,
says:

MELANIE
Hello.

Puts the phone down and says;

MELANIE (CONT'D)
It's for you.

Before Ordell knows it, Melanie is back in the reclining
chair, reclining back all the way.

Ordell, pissed, looks at her a moment before taking the
phone.

ORDELL
(into phone)
Yeah.
(pause)
Hey, Junebug, what's up

Louis sits on he couch, drinking his Jack Daniels,
watching the video.

Melanie lies back on the reclining chair, takes a hit off
her pipe, then says in a 'holding in smoke' voice;

MELANIE
(referring to the tape)
It's boring, isn't it?

LOUIS
I can sit through it once.

MELANIE
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.

LOUIS
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.

MELANIE
He's just repeating shit he
overheard. He ain't any more a gun
expert than I am.

Holding up her pipe.

MELANIE
Want a hit?

LOUIS
Sure.

Louis takes a hit off the pipe.

MELANIE
When did you get out of jail?

LOUIS
Four days ago.

MELANIE
Where at?

LOUIS
Susanville.

MELANIE
How long?

LOUIS
Two months shy of four years.

MELANIE
Four years?

LOUIS
Uh-huh.

MELANIE
What for?

LOUIS
Bank robbery.

MELANIE
Really, I'm impressed.

Louis takes a drink of whiskey.

MELANIE
Four years that's a long fuckin time.

Louis nods his head in agreement.

Ordell hangs up the phone.

Ordell comes back, sitting down on the other side of
Louis.

ORDELL
See, what did I tell you? Man in New
York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and
Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want
it? It's the gun that nigga on "New
York Undercover" uses. Because of
that nigga, I can sell it to this
nigga for twelve-fifty.

LOUIS
What's your cost?

ORDELL
As low as two.

LOUIS
Are you serious?

ORDELL
That's what I been tellin' you. Start
adding these motherfuckin' figures
up, and you tell me this ain't a
business to be in.

The phone rings again.

Ordell looks at Melanie.

Melanie looks at Ordell.

They have a bit of a staring contest before she gets up
and gets the phone.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
I got me five M-60 machine guns.
These came straight from the Gulf
War. I sold me three of them so far,
twenty grand a piece.

LOUIS
That's good money.

ORDELL
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna
make me a million dollars out of
this. I already got me a half-a-
million sittin' in Mexico. When I do
this last delivery, I'm gonna make me
another half-million.

LOUIS
Then what?

ORDELL
I get out. Spend the rest of my life
spending.

Melanie sits back down in he chair.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Who is it?

MELANIE
It's Beaumont.


KITCHEN

Ordell, drink in hand, picks up the receiver.

ORDELL
(into phone)
Beaumont Ordell. What's the problem?
(pause)
What the fuck you doin' in jail?
(pause)
What the fuck you doin' that for?
(pause)
Ain't you got better sense than to be
drivin' drunk carrying a goddam
pistol?

He listens to Beaumont on the other line - it's obvious
Beaumont's starting to freak out. Ordell changes his
tone.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
- Beaumont. Beaumont. Listen to me.
Number one, you need to chill out,
nigga. Bad as this shit is, this shit
ain't as bad as you think it is.
(pause)
Course you're scared. That's what
these motherfuckers get paid for
scarin' the shit outta ya. That's
their job. And my job is to get you
the fuck home so let me tell you what
is gonna happen... May I speak?...
Thank you... You gonna spend the
night in jail; it's too late to get
you out now. Tomorrow, they gonna
take you into court. I'm gonna be
there. Judge gonna set your bail. I'm
gonna pay your bail, they gonna cut
you loose. By tomorrow night, you'll
be back home, I promise.
(pause)
So just calm your ass down, and I'll
see you tomorrow.
(pause)
You owe me a helluva lot more than
one, nigga.
(laughs)
See you.

Ordell hangs up the phone.

CUT TO:


EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY

The store front window of Cherry Bail Bonds in Inglewood,
California. The name of the business is spelled out on
the window, which also includes a drawing of a fat red
cherry.

Ordell's BLACK MERCEDES CONVERTIBLE pulls up.

Ordell in the driver's seat. Louis in shotgun position.


INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY

Inside Cherry Bail Bonds, looking out through the picture
window. We can read the name on the glass backwards.
Ordell and Louis appears in the window and enter the
building. Ordell carries a L.A. Lakers athletic bag.

An unidentified MALE VOICE, obviously on the telephone,
can be heard.

Ordell goes toward the voice and tells Louis to "hang
back."

MALE VOICE (O.S.)
... the judge doesn't give a fuck
about that. He's ready to habitualize
you. Is that what you want - you
wanna look at ten years?

The voice belong to MAX CHERRY, bail bondsman. Max, a
regular-Joe-type white guy in his fifties, sits behind
his desk talking on the phone. His eyes raise as he sees
Ordell approach him.

MAX (CONT'D)
(on phone)
Just overnight is all. Tomorrow I'll
get you out, I promise. But it means
I gotta pick you up tonight.

Ordell motion to the chair in front of Max's desk. Max
motions for Ordell to take a seat.

MAX (CONT'D)
(on phone)
Reggie, there ain't no two ways about
it. You're spending the night in
jail, but I already told you I'll get
you out tomorrow. Now where are you?
(pause)
You're at your mother's house, aren't
you?

Ordell lights up a cigarette. (Viceroy).

He notices a picture on the wall of Max with his arm
around a big, powerfully built black man. They're both
grinning.

Louis pours himself some coffee from a coffeemaker into a
small, white styrofoam cup. He picks up a jar of powdered
non-dairy creamer that's so dry he has to break off a
rock. Louis adds the rock of coffeemate to his beverage.

MAX (CONT'D)
(on phone)
Okay. Just stay put till I come for
you.
(pause)
Reggie, do yourself a really big
favor and be there when I get there.

He hangs up the phone.

Ordell sits in front of the desk, smiling at him and
smoking.

MAX (CONT'D)
How can I help you?

ORDELL
(indicating the Viceroy)
Where would you like me to put my
ash?

Max looks at him for a moment.

MAX
Use that coffee cup on the desk.

Ordell picks up the coffee cup, which still has a little
bit of coffee in it, and flicks his ash.

ORDELL
And I need me a bond for ten
thousand.

Max throws a look past Ordell to Louis.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Oh, that's just my white friend,
Louis. He's got nothing to do with my
business. We just hangin together.
We're on our way to a cocktail
lounge.

From across the room, Louis nods his head in Max's
direction.

Max looks at him a moment, then back to Ordell.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
(returning to the photo)
Who's that big Mandingo nigga you
gotcha arm around?

Max looks at him a moment and says;

MAX
That's Winston. He works here.

ORDELL
He's a big one. You two tight?

MAX
Yeah.

ORDELL
It was our idea to take the picture,
wasn't it?

Max looks at Ordell, getting his drift, then says;

MAX
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar
bond. What've you got for collateral?

ORDELL
Gonna have to put up cash.

MAX
You have it with you?

Ordell picks up his Lakers bag and puts it in the empty
chair next to him.

ORDELL
It's in my bag.

MAX
You have cash. What do you need me
for?

ORDELL
C'mon, you know how they do. Black
man comes in with ten thousand, they
wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they
gonna wanna know where I got it.
Second, they gonna keep a big chunk
of it - start talkin' that court cost
shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go
through you.

MAX
Cost you a thousand for the bond.

ORDELL
I know that.

Louis just stands, feeling uncomfortable, in the other
room drinking coffee.

MAX
Who's it for? A relative?

ORDELL
Fella named Beaumont. They have him
up at county. It started out drunk
driving, but they wrote it up
"possession of a concealed weapon."
Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.

MAX
Ten thousand sounds high.

ORDELL
They ran his name and got a hit. He's
been in before. Besides, Beaumont's
from Kentucky, and I think they're
prejudiced against black men from the
South out here.

MAX
He takes off and I gotta go to
Kentucky to bring him back, you pay
the expenses.

ORDELL
You think you could do that?

Max taking papers out of the drawer...

MAX
I've done it.

... picking up the pen...

MAX (CONT'D)
What's his full name?

ORDELL
Beaumont. That's the only name I
know.

Max looks at Ordell, but doesn't ask him the obvious
question.

Max picks up the phone.

MAX
(on phone)
Records office.

Max on hold, looks at Ordell.

Ordell smiles.

MAX (CONT'D)
(back on the line)
Hello, this is Max Cherry. Cherry
Bail Bonds. Who's this?
(pause)
Hi, Vicki. Look, Vicki, I need you to
look up the booking card and rough
arrest on a defendant named Beaumont.
(pause)
That's all I have. I believe it's a
surname but I'm not sure. Thanks.

Louis enters the area, standing over Ordell.

LOUIS
I'm going to wait in the car.

ORDELL
Sure.
(to Max)
We almost done, ain't we?

MAX
Getting there.

ORDELL
You go wait in the car. Wait a
minute.

Ordell pulls out a heavy-duty keychain with a shitload of
keys on it.

ORDELL
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.

LOUIS
Which one is for the car?

Ordell finds it. While he goes through the keys, Vicki
comes back on the line.

Max speaks with her as he fills out his papers.

ORDELL
(holding a key)
This one's for the ignition...
(holding a little black
box)
... but you gotta hit this thing to
shut the alarm off and unlock the
door.

LOUIS
What do I do?

ORDELL
You ain't got to do nothing. Just
point at it and push the button.
You'll hear the car go "bleep." That
means the alarm's off and the doors
are open.

LOUIS
Okay.

ORDELL
Now play the volume as loud as you
want but don't touch my levels. I got
them set just the way I want 'em.

Louis nods and goes out.


EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY

Louis walks out of the office. He goes up to Ordell's
black Mercedes. He points the little black box at it. The
car goes BLEEP.

He gingerly approaches it, opens the door and climbs
inside.


INT. MAX CHERRY'S OFFICE - DAY

Max hangs up the phone.

MAX
(to Ordell)
Beaumont Livingston.

ORDELL
Livingston, huh?

MAX
On his prior, he served nine months,
and he's working on four years'
probation.

ORDELL
You don't say.

MAX
Do you know what he's on probation
for?

ORDELL
Haven't a clue.

MAX
Possession of unregistered machine
guns.

ORDELL
Will they consider this a violation
of his probation?

MAX
They do consider this a violation of
his probation. Your boy's looking at
ten years, plus the concealed weapon.

ORDELL
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont
don't got a doin' time disposition.

MAX
I need your name and address.

ORDELL
Ordell Robbie. O-R-D-E-L-L. R-O-B-B-I-
E. 1436 Florence Boulevard. Compton
90222.

MAX
House or apartment?

ORDELL
House.

MAX
Now I need you to count your money.

Ordell hands him the Lakers bag. Max takes the money out
putting it on the desk.

ORDELL
Hope you don't mind me askin' where
you keepin' my money till I get it
back. In your drawer?

Max begins counting it.

MAX
Across the street a Great Western. It
goes in a trust account. You'll need
to fill out an Application for
Appearance Bond, an Indemnity
Agreement, a Contingent Promissory
Note. That's the one, if Beaumont
skips and I go after him, you pay the
expenses.

ORDELL
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.
(he takes a pen out of
his pocket)
Where do I sign?

Max pulls the forms from his desk, and lays them in front
of Ordell. Max goes back to counting the money. Ordell
reads the first agreement then says;

ORDELL (CONT'D)
(reading the form)
Hey, Max.

MAX
(still counting money)
Yes.

ORDELL
(still reading form)
I was wondering. What if before the
court date gets here, Beaumont gets
hit by a bus or something and dies.
(he puts the form down
and looks at Max)
I get my money back, don't I?

CUT TO:


A BLACK FINGER

Pressing a BLACK BUTTON next to the name, "BEAUMONT
LIVINGSTON".


INT. BEAUMONT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

BEAUMONT LIVINGSTON, wearing no shirt, sweatpants, and
smoking a fatty answers the intercom, which buzzes
loudly. We can hear JAY LENO interviewing a CELEBRITY on
TV OFFSCREEN.

BEAUMONT
(into the speaker)
Who is it?


EXT. BEAUMONT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ordell stands outside the security gate of Beaumont's
Hollywood apartment.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - Ordell's lips talking into the intercom
speaker.

ORDELL
It's your benefactor, nigga. Buzz me
up.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - Beaumont's finger pressing the entry
button.

EXTREME CLOSEUP - The doorknob on the security gate,
BUZZING. Ordell's hand comes into frame twisting it open.

Beaumont opens his apartment door, fatty between his
fingers. He sees Ordell approach.

Ordell greets him, arms spread out in hug mode, with a
big smile across his face.

ORDELL
Look at you and your free ass. Come
over and give me a motherfuckin' hug.

Ordell and Beaumont embrace.

BEAUMONT
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious,
man. What the fuck can I say? Thank
you... thank you... thank you.

ORDELL
Who was there for your ass?

BEAUMONT
You were there for me.

ORDELL
Who?

BEAUMONT
You.

Laughing his hustler's laugh and bumping Beaumont's fist
hard.

ORDELL
You goddam right!

Beaumont laughs.

ORDELL
You see, it works like this. You get
your ass in trouble, I get your ass
out. That's my job. And I don't mind
tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.

BEAUMONT
I'm still scared as a motherfucker,
Ordell. They talkin' like they
serious 'bout me doin' that machine
gun time.

ORDELL
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a
fright in your ass.

BEAUMONT
If that's what they want to do,
they're doin' it.

ORDELL
How old is that machine gun shit?

BEAUMONT
Three years.

ORDELL
Three years. That crime's old, man.
They ain't got room in prison for all
the motherfuckers out there killin'
people. How they gonna find room for
you?

BEAUMONT
That's not what they're tellin' me.

ORDELL
That's why they call it "fuckin' with
ya." Now you wanna hear how we
retaliate?

Beaumont takes a hit off the fatty and nods his head.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Tomorrow I pick you up, take you to
Century City, meet my lawyer. Now let
me tell you a little bit about my
lawyer. His name is Stacin Goins and
this nigga is a junkyard dog! He's my
own private Johnie Cochran. In fact,
he'd kick Johnie Cochran's ass. And
like Johnie Cochran, dude hates
fuckin' cops. I'm serious, this man
lives to fuck with the police. So as
a favor, I had him look at your case.
Stacin told me you aint got shit to
worry about. They just fuckin' wit
ya. So we sic the junkyard dog on
their ass, make 'em -
(he bumps fist with Beaumont)
... Stop fuckin' wit ya!

Beaumont gesture inside his apartment.

BEAUMONT
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just - you
know - smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.

ORDELL
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was
kinda hopin you could come with me.

BEAUMONT
What'd ya mean?

ORDELL
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga,
does a nigga a favor - then BAM -
hits a nigga up for a favor in
return. But I'm afraid I gotta be
that kinda nigga.

BEAUMONT
What?

ORDELL
I need a favor.

BEAUMONT
That requires me goin out tonight?

ORDELL
A bit.

BEAUMONT
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on
goin no place. It's twelve o'clock,
man. I'm home, I'm high -


ORDELL
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I
spent ten thousand dollars gittin'
your ass home.
(changes tone)
Look, I gotta problem. I need help,
and you can help me.

This has the desired effect.

TIME CUT:


WITH ORDELL WAITING OUTSIDE THE DOOR

Beaumont comes out of the apartment, sporting Nikes and a
Queen Latifah t-shirt. He locks his front door and walks
with Ordell to his car. They talk the whole way. We
STEDICAM in front of them the whole way.

BEAUMONT
What's the problem?

ORDELL
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a
situation. Remember I sold those
three M-60 machine guns outta the
five I got?

BEAUMONT
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight.
This group of Koreans in Koreatown
have started a Neighborhood Watch
kinda thing. And they want a few
weapons so the neighborhood niggas
know they mean business. So I'm gonna
sell 'em my two machine guns tonight.
Only problem, I aint never dealt with
these Koreans before. Now I aint
worried. Asians are by and large real
dependable. They don't want no
trouble. You might argue about price,
but you aint gotta worry about them
shootin' you in the back. But I got
me kind of a rule. Never do business
with nobody you ain't never done
business with before without backup.
That's why I need you, backup.

BEAUMONT
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out
nowhere -

ORDELL
- Let me finish. Can I finish?

BEAUMONT
Go ahead.

CUT TO:


TRUNK

The trunk of a car is opened.

Ordell bends down into the trunk and pulls out a pump
action shotgun. Beaumont obviously doesn't want any part
of any Ordell game that requires a pump action shotgun as
a playing piece.

ORDELL
Now you're gonn be in the trunk
holding onto the shotgun. And I'm
going to tell them I'm opening up my
trunk to show 'em my goods. I open up
the trunk, you pop up, rack that bad
boy.

BEAUMONT
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin'
anybody.

ORDELL
What the fuck I tell you. You don't
hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the
gun. They'll get the idea.

BEAUMONT
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.

ORDELL
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll
be in there - ten minutes.

BEAUMONT
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk
no minutes. Why don't I just ride
with you?

ORDELL
You can't ride with me. The surprise
effect is ninety percent of it.

BEAUMONT
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't
gittin' in that trunk.

ORDELL
I can't believe you do me this way.

BEAUMONT
I ain't doin' you no way. I just
ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a
problem with small places.

ORDELL
Well, my ass has got a problem
spending ten thousand dollars of my
own goddam money to get ungrateful,
peanut-head niggas outta jail, but I
do it -

BEAUMONT
Look, man, I know I owe you -

ORDELL
- Well, if you owe me, git your ass
in the trunk.

BEAUMONT
- I wanna help you, but I don't wanna
be locked in the trunk of no car.

ORDELL
You think I wanted to spend ten
thousand dollars on your ass?

Beaumont starts to speak -

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Answer the question, nigga. Do you
think I wanted to spend the thousand
dollars on your ass? Yes or no?

BEAUMONT
Course you didn't.

ORDELL
But the only way to help you was to
do that, so I did it. (pause) Okay,
how 'bout this? After we're through
fuckin' with these Koreans, I take
you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
My treat.

Beaumont smiles. So does Ordell.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Just think, man. That Scoe's special,
smothered in gravy and onions. Get a
side of red beans and rice.
Uuuuummmmm, that's some good eatin'.

Beaumont and Ordell laugh together... the Beaumont says;

BEAUMONT
Now exactly how long I gotta be in
this motherfucker.

CUT TO:


TRUNK

Beaumont in the trunk, holding the shotgun. The trunk lid
is SLAMMED closed.


EXT.   INT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT

Ordell walks around the car, climbs into the plush
interior of the Olds and turns on the engine. It comes to
life with a SOFT RUMBLE. He puts a tape in the player
inside the dash.

The tape is labeled "ORDELL'S JAMS."

Cool, old-school R B fills the cab.

Ordell cruises, moving his head to the rhythm and
mouthing the words.

He drives for awhile, just groovin' on the music...

... then stops.

Ordell switches the engine and the music off. The cab
goes black.

He leans over the passenger seat, opening the glovebox. A
tiny light turns on when the glovebox is opened. It's the
only light in the cab. Ordell leaves it on.

In silence he takes one glove out and puts it on his
right hand. Then with his gloved hand, reaches in the
glovebox and pulls out a five-shot .38 snubby. He closes
the glovebox.

The cab goes black.


EXT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT

The Olds is parked out in the middle of some urban
nowhere.

Ordell gets out, sticks the snubby in his pants, and
walks to the back of the Olds. He sticks his key in the
trunk and says;

ORDELL
Don't worry. It's just me.

The trunk opens. Beaumont is hunched on his side with the
shotgun.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
I was wondering. Did any federal
people come visit you in jail and I
should be watching my ass?

Beaumont doesn't say anything.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
You wouldn't tell me if they did and
I wouldn't blame you.

Ordell takes the snubby out of his pants.

Beaumont quick-racks the pump shotgun, pulls the trigger,
and hears the click you hear from an empty weapon. He
racks it again, CLICK then BAM. Beaumont is shot hard in
the chest. He goes back into he trunk.

Ordell puts one more shot in his head, BAM, tosses the
weapon on top of the dead body and closes the trunk.

Ordell's Beaumont problem is solved. He climbs back into
the cab, turns on the engine. We hear the old-school R B
song come back on, but VERY LOW.

Ordell drives the Olds away.

CUT TO:


INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

Louis sits on a bed in a flophouse motel room, flipping
from one channel to another with a remote control,
drinking cocktails from a can.

The phone rings. He answers it.

LOUIS
Hello.


INT. OLDSMOBILE (PARKED) - NIGHT

Ordell is sitting parked in the comfy-cozy cab of the
Olds, listening to soul music with his tiny cellular
phone next to his ear.

ORDELL
Louis, my man. Watcha doin'?

LOUIS
Oh, I dunno. Watching TV.

ORDELL
Whatcha watchin'?

LOUIS
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back
and forth. They had some black girl
from some black show on Jay Leno. I
watched that for a bit, but I kept
flippin channels cause I didn't know
who she was.

ORDELL
Guess where I am?

LOUIS
I dunno.

ORDELL
I know you don't know. I said guess.

LOUIS
The moon - I dunno

ORDELL
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy-
cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked
outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.

LOUIS
You're outside?

ORDELL
Uh-huh.

LOUIS
C'mon in.

ORDELL
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm
comfortable. I ain't about to walk
into that roach motel and get
uncomfortable. You bring your ass out
here.

LOUIS
I'm in my underwear.

ORDELL
Then put your goddam drawers on, and
get your ass out here. I got
somethin' to show you.


EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

Louis, having just thrown on some pants, walks outside
his room and sees Ordell's big, black Oldsmobile parked
in front of the motel.

As he approaches, the power window on the driver's side
comes down, revealing a comfortable Ordell sitting back
in his seat looking up at Louis.

ORDELL
You know what your problem is, Louis?

Louis doesn't say anything, he just puts his hands in his
pockets.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
You think you're a good guy. When you
go into a deal you don't go in
prepared to take that motherfucker
all the way. You go in looking for a
way out. And it ain't cause you're
scared neither. It's cause you think
you're a good guy, and you think
there's certain things a good guy
won't do. That's where we're
different, me and you. Cause me, once
I decide I want something, aint a
goddam motherfuckin' thing gonna stop
me from gittin' it. I gotta use a gun
get what I want, I'm gonna use a gun.
Nigga gets in my way, nigga gonna get
removed. Understand what I'm saying?


CLOSEUP: KEY GOING INTO TRUNK

Trunk opens showing Beaumont shot in the chest with half
his head blown off.

Louis looks inside, see Beaumont, looks at Ordell, then
back to Beaumont.

Ordell closes the trunk.

LOUIS
Who was that?

ORDELL
That was Beaumont.

LOUIS
Who was Beaumont?

ORDELL
An employee I had to let go.

LOUIS
What did he do?

ORDELL
He put himself in a situation where
he was gonna have to do ten years in
the penetentiary, that's what he did.
(taking out a Viceroy and
lighting it up)
And if you know Beaumont, you know
there aint no way in hell he can do
no ten years. And if you know that,
you know Beaumont's gonna go any
goddam thing Beaumont can to keep
from doin' those ten years including
telling the Federal government
everything they want to know about my
ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear
case of him or me. And you best
believe it aint gonna be me. You know
what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on
this with me, you gotta be prepared
to go all the way. I got me so far
over a half-a-million dollars sittin'
in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San
Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one
more delivery, I'm gonna have me over
a million. You think I'm gonna let
this little cheese eatin' nigga here
fuck that up? Shit, you better think
again. 'Fore I let this deal get
fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in
the head, and ten niggas look just
like em.
(pause)
Understand what I'm sayin'?

LOUIS
Yeah.

ORDELL
So we on the same page then?

LOUIS
I follow.

Ordell smiles (not his hustler smile, but a genuine
smile).

Louis grins.

They both bump fists.

FADE TO BLACK:


TITLE CARD:

"JACKIE BROWN"

The sound of airplanes landing and taking off can be
heard underneath this...


INT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

A SUBTITLE reads:

"LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE"

We look down a row of cars in an enclosed parking garage
at LAX. Jackie Brown, the Cabo Air stewardess from the
opening credits, walks into frame. We dolly behind her as
she walks down the row of cars.

VOICE (O.S.)
Miss Brown.

She turns towards the voice camera.

Young plainclothes cop, MARK DARGUS, walks up to her,
holding open his I.D. case.

DARGUS
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus.
L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in
that bag?

JACKIE
The usual things. I'm a flight
attendant with Cabo Air.

Young plainclothes cop RAY NICOLET, enters the scene.

NICOLET
Can I be of some assistance?

As Jackie pulls the cigarettes (Davidoffs) from her
purse, she says to Ray;

JACKIE
I doubt it.
(to Dargus)
Who's your friend?

DARGUS
This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet
with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
Would you mind if we looked in that
bag?

Jackie lights her cigarette with a yellow Bic lighter.

JACKIE
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?

DARGUS
You have the right to say "no." And I
have the right to make you wait here
with Ray while I go get a warrant.
And if I don't want to go through all
that trouble, I could just take you
in on suspicion.

JACKIE
Suspicion of what?

NICOLET
All he wants to do is peek in your
bag. I'll watch he doesn't take
anything.

Jackie shrugs and says;

JACKIE
Go ahead.

Dargus lays the flight bag on the pavement, gets down on
his haunches, and starts feeling through her things.


CLOSEUP FLIGHT BAG

A soiled blouse, uniform skirt, - then a manila envelope,
a fat one, nine-by-twelve.

Jackie watches him straighten the clasp...


ENVELOPE

Opens it. Out drops several packets of one hundred dollar
bills secured with rubberbands.

Nicolet whistles.

Dargus looks up at her.

DARGUS
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty
thousand dollars here. What would you
say Ray?

NICOLET
That looks like fifty thousand
dollars from here.


JACKIE

Not saying anything at the moment.

DARGUS
This is your money?

JACKIE
If I were to tell you "no it
isn't..."

Dargus smiles.

DARGUS
You should know if you bring in
anything over ten thousand you have
to declare it. You forgot or what?
You could get a two hundred and fifty
thousand dollar fine, plus two years
in prison. Now you want to talk to us
about it, or you want to talk to
Customs?

JACKIE
I'm not saying another word.

NICOLET
Listen, Jackie, Hope you don't mind
if I call you Jackie. They're a bunch
of fuckin' pricks in Customs.
Something about that job makes them
kinda hard to get along with. Now, do
you want to talk with a bunch of
suspicious, disagreeable people like
them, or a couple good-hearted guys
like Mark and myself.

Nicolet smiles.


CLOSEUP JACKIE

Doesn't smile back.

DISSOLVE TO:


CLOSEUP JACKIE

Sitting in a chair facing the two offscreen detectives.
Jackie lights up a cigarette. We don't leave the CLOSEUP
until noted.


INT. DARGUS OFFICE - DAY

DARGUS (O.S.)
Hey, this is my office. There's no
smoking.

JACKIE
Arrest me.

Nicolet laughs O.S.

DARGUS (O.S.)
We could, smart ass... or we could
work out what's known as a
Substantial Assistance Agreement.
That is if you're willing to
cooperate. Tell us who gave you the
money and who you're giving it to.

Jackie doesn't sat anything... she just smokes.

NICOLET (O.S.)
You got a good lawyer?

DARGUS (O.S.)
Can she afford a good one is the
question. Otherwise she'll be in
Sybill Brand three weeks easy before
the Public Defender gets around to
her.

NICOLET (O.S.)
Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont
Livingston?

Not a word.

NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Don't know Beaumont? That's funny
'cause Beaumont knows you. Well he
did know you, Beaumont was found in
the trunk of a car - dead. Shot
twice. Once in the head and once in
the chest.

Jackie, she puts the "ool" in "cool."

NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)
I had the chance to talk to Beaumont
yesterday. You see, like you,
Beaumont found himself in some hot
water. He was looking at ten years he
was pretty sure he didn't want to do
and was understandably concerned. Now
maybe you don't know Beaumont, but
Beaumont knew you, and maybe so does
the guy who blew Beaumont's head off.

Not a word.

DARGUS (O.S.)
If you don't want to talk to us, I
guess we'll just have to hand you
over to Customs.

Jackie puts out her cigarette.

JACKIE
Okay, let's go.

She stares down the cops.


DARGUS AND NICOLET

We cut to the detective and the special agent for the
first time in the scene.

DARGUS
You know, Miss Brown, there's
basically three types of people that
we come along in the performance of
our duty. One is, INNOCENT PEOPLE.
Victims, witnesses, innocent
bystanders... You ain't any of these.
Then there's two; CRIMINALS. These
sonabitches have dedicated their
lives to a life outside the law. That
ain't you either. Where you belong is
the third category. The category we
refer to as LOSERS.

Jackie's eyes don't even narrow at the insult. She just
says without expression;

JACKIE
I'm not a loser.

DARGUS
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were
flying for TWA and got busted for
carrying drugs. You were carrying
them for a pilot husband of yours. He
did time and you got off. But that
ended your career with the big
airlines. Cut to thirteen years
later. You're forty-four years of
age. You're flying for the shittiest
little shuttle-fucking piece of shit
Mexican airline that there is. Where
you make a whopping twelve-thousand
dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva
lot to show for a twenty year career.
And to top it off, you're going to
jail. Now true, the judge, even with
your prior, will probably only give
you a year or two. But this doesn't
seem like the time of life you got
years to throw away.
(pause)
Now, we don't like trying losers like
they're criminals. But in the absence
of a criminal, we will try you. Now,
wasn't this money given to you by an
American living in Mexico by the name
of Cedric Walker?

Jackie remains unmoved by this monologue.

Nicolet joins back in.

NICOLET
You know, ol' Beaumont wasn't much
for talkin', either. Yeah, he told us
about you and Mr. Walker, but whoever
the hell it was he worked for out
here, he wouldn't say. Could it be
the same person you were supposed to
deliver this money to?

Jackie just stares at them, saying nothing.

Dargus sits behind his desk, with Jackie's flight bag on
it.

DARGUS
I'd like your permission to open this
again. So we'll know exactly how much
money we're talkin' about here.

Jackie gets up from her chair, walks over to the desk,
unzips the bag, takes out the manila envelope and drops
it on the desk.

JACKIE
Help yourself.

DARGUS
While you're at it, let me see what
else is in there. You mind?

She reaches in the bag and brings out a pocketbook.

JACKIE
My pocketbook.

DARGUS
What's in it?

JACKIE
Beauty products.

Nicolet takes the manila envelope.

NICOLET
I'll count the money.

Dargus points at a clear plastic bag with pills and
packets in it.

DARGUS
What's this?

JACKIE
That's my diet shit.

Nicolet takes out the bills from the envelope.

DARGUS
Let's see what else is in there.

Nicolet takes the bills and looks inside the envelope.
His expression changes to a shit-eating grin.

NICOLET
Oh, Miss Brown?

JACKIE
Yeah?

Nicolet pulls out a clear cellophane sandwich bag with a
half-inch or so of white powder inside.

NICOLET
And what would this be, Sweet and
Low?

JACKIE
What the fuck is that shit?

NICOLET
I know what it looks like.

JACKIE
You planted that shit on me.

Nicolet and Dargus laugh at that.

JACKIE
Look, that shit ain't mine.

NICOLET
(to Dargus)
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but
how 'bout Posession with the Intent
to Distribute?

DARGUS
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. What with
all the cash, I think I could go with
Conspiracy to Traffic.

JACKIE
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin'
about that fuckin' shit.

NICOLET
Well then, Miss Brown. Why don't you
have a seat and tell us who might
know something about this fuckin'
shit.

Jackie just looks at the two grinning Cheshire cats as
the balance of power rolls over on her.

CUT TO:


EXT. TORRANCE MUNICIPAL COURTHOUSE - DAY

A Los Angeles County Jail bus pulls up behind the
Torrance Court House.


INT. COUNTY JAIL BUS - DAY

Jackie, now wearing County Jail blues, sits next to
another BLACK WOMAN. Their hands cuffed together.

The bus stops. A rough-looking FEMALE COUNTY SHERIFF
unlocks the gate that encloses the prisoners. Then
explains in a you-better-do-exactly-what-I-say manner,
how they're going to leave the bus.


EXT. COUNTY JAIL BUS - DAY

MANY WOMEN, including Jackie, all wearing county blues
and handcuffed to each other, exit the bus.

The SHERIFFS lead them into the back entrance to the
court house.


INT. HALLWAY COURTHOUSE - DAY

Dargus and Nicolet confer with the PUBLIC DEFENDER, an
attractive blonde woman in a nice business suit.

DARGUS
If she'll cooperate with us, we'll
turn possession with intent into
plain ol' Possession, and she can
bond outta here for one thousand
bucks. If she doesn't help us, we'll
go for the Intent and request a
twenty-five-thousand dollar bond.


INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Jackie and the Public Defender. Jackie, in her county
blues; Public Defender in her nice suit.

JACKIE
You tell those guys they'll have to
do one helluva lot better than that
before I'll even say 'hi' to them.

PUBLIC DEFENDER
Well, that's the State's offer. If
you plead to possession and tell
L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your
bond will be set at one-thousand
dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will
request one at twenty- five thousand
based on your prior record and risk
of flight. If you don't post it or
don't know anyone who can, you'll
spend six to eight weeks in County
before your arraignment comes up.

JACKIE
Who's side are you on?

PUBLIC DEFENDER
I beg your pardon?

JACKIE
What if I plead guilty?

PUBLIC DEFENDER
And cooperate? You might get
probation.

JACKIE
If I don't cooperate?

PUBLIC DEFENDER
With the prior? You could get
anywhere from a year to five
depending on the judge. You want to
think about it? You got two minutes
before we're up.


COURT IN SESSION

It's a full schedule in court today. Jackie sits with a
bunch of other females wearing county blues in the
defendant's area (where the jury sits during a jury
trial)

Dargus and Nicolet sit in the courtroom.

The JUDGE reads the next case.

JUDGE
Brown. Case number 700324.

Jackie rises amongst the other defendants.

The P.D. rises.

Dargus, the arresting officer, rises.

JUDGE
The charge is possession of Narcotics
with the Intent to Distribute. How
does your client plead?

PUBLIC DEFENDER
She wishes to stand mute, your honor.

JUDGE
Very well...
(to Dargus)
... Detective Dargus - You're the
arresting officer in his case,
correct?

DARGUS
That's correct, your honor.

JUDGE
You have a recommendation for bail?

DARGUS
Yes, I do, your honor. Based on the
defendant's prior conviction and the
extreme possibility of flight due to
her occupation, the State requests a
bond of no less than twenty-five
thousand.

The Judge looks at the report, then at Jackie...

JUDGE
I'll set bond at ten thousand and set
the date of August 14th for the
arraignment.

JACKIE
When is that, your honor?

JUDGE
That's six weeks from now, Miss
Brown. We'll continue this matter
then. Owens, case 72242.

Jackie sits down.

Dargus sits down next to Nicolet. They smile and giggle
together.

Jackie sees them giggle like fifth graders. It fucking
pisses her off.


DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE

We go from a CLOSEUP of a boiling Jackie, to a
perspective from the back of the courtroom.

We see Jackie in the defendant's area.

We see the two happy detectives walk past us on their way
out of the courtroom.


ORDELL

Sits in the back, watching the proceedings without any
expression. When he's seen enough, he stands up and out
of the shot leaving an EMPTY FRAME.

FADE TO BLACK


TITLE CARD

"MAX CHERRY"

FADE UP ON:


INT. MAX CHERRY'S OFFICE - DAY

The bathroom door in Max's office. We hear a toilet flush
behind it. The door opens, and Max Cherry emerges,
zipping up his pants with a TV guide in his hand.

He looks up and stops dead.

Ordell sitting oh-so comfortably in the chair in front of
Max's desk.

ORDELL
Unh... unh... unh... I din't hear you
wash your hands.

Max looks at Ordell, then takes his place behind his
desk.

MAX
Comfortable?

ORDELL
The door was opened, so I just came
right in.

MAX
I can see that. Why?

ORDELL
I got some more business for ya.

MAX
Oh, yeah? What did he do?

ORDELL (O.S.)
She is an airline stewardess. Got
caught coming back from Mexico with
some blow. They set her bond this
afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what
I was thinkin', you could use the ten
thousand you owe me from Beaumont and
move it over on to the stewardess.

MAX
The bond for possession is only a
thousand.

ORDELL
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin'
it Possession with Intent. A black
woman in her forties gets busted with
less than two ounces on her, they
call that shit Intent. Same shit
happened to a movie star. It's
Possession.

MAX
It still sounds high.

ORDELL
She had, I believe it was... fifty
grand on her, too. There was a cop at
the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D.
wanted her bond set at twenty-five
thousand, saying there was a risk of
flight. Jackie being a stewardess and
all.

MAX
Before we start talking about
stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of
the way first.

Sitting back in the chair - almost grinning - but not
quite.

ORDELL
Somebody already did.

MAX
What?

ORDELL
You didn't hear?

MAX
Hear what?

ORDELL
Somebody with a grudge blew
Beaumont's brains out - hey, that
rhymes - blew Beaumont's brains out.

MAX
Did the police contact you?

ORDELL
Very first motherfuckin' thing they
did. They see I put up a big money
bond on my boy, they start thinking
with that where-there's-smoke-there's
fire logic. They roust my ass outta
bed, ten o'clock in the morning.
Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half
to death. She thought they were gonna
take my ass away for sure.

MAX
The stewardess. Do you know her last
name?

ORDELL
(smiles)
Brown, Jackie Brown.

MAX
What does she do for you?

ORDELL
Who says she does anything for me?
She's my friend. When my friends get
into trouble, I like to help 'em out.

MAX
Beaumont worked for you.

ORDELL
That's what the police thought. I
told them I'm unemployed, how could I
have anybody work for me? Now I bail
out Jackie, I'm liable to have the
police on me again, huh? Wanting to
know was she doing things for me, was
she bringing me that money!

MAX
Was she?

ORDELL
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer-
client relationship? The lawyer can't
tell nothing he hears?

MAX
You're not my client until you get
busted and I bond you out.

ORDELL
If there's no - what do you call it -
confidentiality between us? Why would
I tell you anything?

MAX
Cause you want me to know what a
slick guy you are. You got
stewardesses bringing you fifty
grand.

ORDELL
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty
grand?

MAX
You want me to speculate on what you
do. I'd say you're in the drug
business, except the money's moving
in the wrong direction. Whatever
you're into, you seem to be getting
away with it, so more power to you.
Okay you want another bond, and you
want to move over the ten thousand
you put down on Beaumont to the
stewardess. That means paperwork. I
have to get a death certificate,
present it to the court, fill out a
receipt for return of bond
collateral, then type up another
application. An indemnity agreement -

ORDELL
- Jackie aint got time for all that
shit -

MAX
- I'm telling you what I have to do.
What you have to do, in case you
forgot, is come up with premium of a
thousand bucks.

ORDELL
I got it. I just don't got it on me.

MAX
Well, come back when you do, and I'll
bond out the stewardess.

ORDELL
Man, you know I'm good for it.
Thousand bucks ain't shit.

MAX
If I don't see it in front of me,
you're right. It ain't shit.

ORDELL
Man, you need to look at this with a
little compassion. Jackie ain't no
criminal. She ain't used to this
kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters
don't give a fuck - but for the
average citizen, coupla nights in
County fuck with your mind.

MAX
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you
don't have a tab.

ORDELL
Just listen for a second. We got a
forty-year-old, gainfully employed
black woman, falsely accused -

MAX
Falsely accused? She didn't come back
from Mexico with cocaine on her?

ORDELL
Falsely accused of Intent. If she had
that shit - and mind you, I said "if"
- it was just her shit to get high
with.

MAX
Is white guilt supposed to make me
forget I'm running a business?

Ordell gives up and takes an envelope out of his pocket.

ORDELL
Okay, man. I got your money. But
don't you ever ask me for no fuckin'
favor.


INT. MAX'S CADILLAC (MOVING) - NIGHT

It's early evening; and Max's powder-blue Seville is
driving to the County Jail with a client, a young
Hispanic woman of twenty named ANITA.

MAX
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation
officer. Karen's a good kid, but
she's mad at you, because you lied to
her. This business about your
grandmother's funeral

ANITA
I went. I did. I took my mother and
little brother.

MAX
But you didn't ask permission. You
broke a trust. If you had asked,
Karen probably would have let you.
I'm sure she would.

ANITA
I know. That's why I went.

MAX
But then you told her you were home.

ANITA
Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I
could go.

Max gives up.

MAX
I don't know. Maybe it's a language
problem.
(getting stern)
Anita, you ever cause this much
heartache over something that could
easily be avoided, I'll never write
you again. You understand?

ANITA
I understand.

MAX
I mean it. I don't care how many
times your mother calls or how much
she cries.

Like an exasperated teenager.

ANITA
I understand.

MAX
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."

ANITA
Yes, Max, I understand.


INT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT

POV THROUGH A WIRE MESH CAGE

Max and Anita, side by side. Anita's hands are cuffed
behind her back.

MAX
Dropping off and picking up. Dropping
of Lopez, Anita. Picking up Brown,
Jackie.

We're at the admitting desk of the L.A. County Jail. Max
undoes Anita's handcuffs, while a SHERIFF waits to take
her away.

ANITA
So you're gonna call Karen tomorrow?

MAX
I'll call her.

ANITA
Won't forget?

MAX
I won't forget.

She kisses Max on the cheek and the Sheriff takes her
away.

ANITA
Thanks, Max. See you later.

Max puts the cuffs away, sits on a bench, takes out a Len
Deighton paperback and begins to read.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:


MAX

Still reading his novel. We hear offscreen, a SHERIFF'S
voice.

SHERIFF (O.S.)
Max! Here she comes.

Max puts his book down and see -

Jackie being led into the Admitting Area by TWO SHERIFFS.
She's wearing her stewardess uniform and carrying a small
envelope with her belongings in it and her shoes. When
Max was imagining a woman in her forties, he had someone
with a bit of wear and tear on them in mind. But this
Jackie Brown's a knockout.

As he watches her, she steps out of the County Jail
slippers she was wearing and slips into her shoes.

He approaches, handing her his card.

MAX
Miss Brown... I'm Max Cherry. I'm
your bail bondsman.

She takes the card and shakes his hand saying nothing.

MAX (CONT'D)
I can give you a lift home if you'd
like?

JACKIE
Okay.


INT. MAX'S CADILLAC - NIGHT

Max puts his key in the ignition, when Jackie asks;

JACKIE
Are you really a bail bondsman?

MAX
Who do you think I am?

She doesn't answer.

MAX (CONT'D)
I gave you my card there.

JACKIE
Can I see your I.D.?

MAX
You're serious?

She waits.

Max digs the case out of his pocket, hands it to her,
then reaches up and turns on the light above them for her
to see.


MAX'S ID: SURETY AGENT LICENSED BY THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA

JACKIE
Who put up my bond? Ordell?

MAX
In cash.

She looks straight ahead.

Max shifts into drive.

Max rolls down his window at the front gate. A DEPUTY
comes out of the gatehouse and hands through the window
Max's .38 revolver, cylinder opened. Max hands the Deputy
his pass in exchange for the gun, says "thanks", then
puts the .38 in his glovebox in front of Jackie. He
drives on.


MAX AND JACKIE (MOVING)

JACKIE
Can we stop for cigarettes?

MAX
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?

JACKIE
I don't think so.

MAX
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.

JACKIE
Couldn't we just stop at a seven-
eleven?

MAX
I thought you might want a drink?

JACKIE
I'd love one, but not there.

MAX
We could stop at the Hilton by the
airport.

JACKIE
Is it dark?

MAX
It's kind of a sports bar

JACKIE
That doesn't sound dark.

MAX
Why does it need to be dark?

JACKIE
'Cause I look like I just got outta
jail, that's why. You droppin' me off
at home, right? There's a place by
me.

MAX
Great.

CUT TO:


EXT. THE COCKATOO INN - NIGHT

A big neon sign of a cockatoo sits on op of a red brick
inn.


INT. THE COCKATOO INN - NIGHT

CLOSEUP - A KNOB is pulled out.

Jackie picks up a pack of Mild Seven's cigarettes from
the bottom of a cigarette machine. She crosses the bar to
join Max, sitting at a small table waiting for her to
return.

The Cockatoo Inn is just what Jackie was looking for. A
dark and red cocktail lounge in Hawthorne off of
Hawthorne Boulevard by the apartment where the stewardess
lives (about ten minutes from LAX)

The clientele of the Cockatoo is an older, black crowd
and an even older white crowd who'd been coming here
years before it became a black bar.

A JUKEBOX plays soft, old-school R B.

Jackie and Max sit side by side at a small table, lit by
a bar candle in a red glass thing.

Max drinks Bushmills over crushed ice. Jackie drinks
white wine. Jackie opens her Mild Sevens, offering one to
Max.

MAX
No thanks, I quit three years ago.

As she lights her cigarette.

JACKIE
You gain weight?

MAX
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back
on.

JACKIE
That's why I don't quit. If I can't
fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch
of a time gettin' my brand.

MAX
What's your brand?

JACKIE
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico.
They're hard to find here. I was
locked up with the last two getting
legal advice from a woman who was in
for bustin' her boyfriend's head open
with a baseball bat.

MAX
Was she helpful?

JACKIE
She was more helpful than the fuckin'
Public Defender.
(she takes a sip of wine)
I don't know - I guess what I need is
a lawyer, find out what my options
are.

MAX
You know, I figured out the other day
I've written something like' fifteen
thousand bonds since I've been in the
business. I'd say about eighty
percent of them were at least drug
related. If you want, I can help you
look at your options.

Jackie takes the talk in a different direction.

JACKIE
You're not tired of it?

MAX
(smiles)
I am, as a matter of fact.

A moment of silence between them, they both take drinks.

MAX (CONT'D)
What have they told you?

JACKIE
So far I've been told I can cooperate
and get probation, maybe. Or, I can
stand mute and get as much as five
years. Does that sound right?

MAX
I'd say if you're tried and found
guilty you won't get more than a year
and a day. That's State time. Prison.

JACKIE
(under her breath)
Shit.

MAX
But they won't want to take you to
trial. They'll offer you simple
Possession, a few months of County
time, and a year or two probation.
(pointing to her drink)
How 'bout another?

JACKIE
Sure.

Max gestures to an older black cocktail waitress named
ROWEN for two more.

MAX
You know who put the dope in your
bag?

JACKIE
Yeah, but that's not what this was
about. They were fuckin waitin' for
my ass. They knew I had that money,
they even knew the amount. The one
who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D.,
Dargus, hardly even looked at it.
"Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand
here. What would you say?" But all
they could do was threaten me and
hand me over to Customs, and I could
tell they didn't want to do that.

MAX
They wanted you to tell them what you
know.

JACKIE
I had 'em too. I burnt those two
Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down.
Then their asses lucked out and found
that coke.

MAX
What did they want to know?

JACKIE
Who gave me the money and who I was
giving it to. And some guy they found
in a trunk with his head blown off.
Said it was him who told them 'bout
me.

The Waitress comes with the drinks.

ROWEN
Can I get you two some popcorn?

MAX
No, thanks.

Rowen exits.

MAX (CONT'D)
That would be Beaumont Livingston.

JACKIE
That's him. How do you know 'em?

MAX
I wrote him on Monday. They found him
dead on Tuesday.

JACKIE
Ordell pick up his bond?

MAX
Same as you. Ten thousand.

JACKIE
The federal agent kinda half hinted
Ordell might of done Beaumont.

MAX
You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D.,
but you didn't mention the Federal.

JACKIE
I didn't?

MAX
No, you didn't. What branch?

JACKIE
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms.

Max puts it together.

MAX
He's the one who wants you.

JACKIE
It was the other guy who busted me.

MAX
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play
hell bonding out of federal court. He
doesn't want you mad at him, he wants
you to tell him what you know. He
uses you to get a line on Ordell,
make a case, then take him federal.
You know what Ordell's into?

JACKIE
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell
aint no bootlegger and I doubt he's
smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only
leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would
be interested in.

Jackie waits a moment before answering, weighs things in
her mind and makes a decision.

JACKIE
I used to bring over ten thousand at
a time. That's the legal limit, so I
never brought more than that.

MAX
How many trips did you make?

JACKIE
With ten thousand? Nine.

MAX
He's got that kinda money?

JACKIE
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico
bank. But he's got a problem. He's -
what do you call it when you got
money, but don't have cash?

MAX
Cash poor?

JACKIE
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on
me till I finally said okay. I'll
bring whatever fits in a nine-by-
twelve envelope. I got paid five
hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr.
Walker, in Mexico gave me the
envelope.

MAX
If you knew bringing anything over
ten thousand was against the law, why
not pack a hundred grand?

Jackie gets exasperated.

JACKIE
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag
and not hit you in the face if the
bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my
problem. I gotta figure out a way to
either keep my job or get out of
trouble. I'm of today, but if I can't
leave the country I'm out of a job.
And if I don't got a job, I can't
hire a lawyer.

MAX
Ask A.T.F. They might give you
permission.

JACKIE
Yeah, if I cooperate.

MAX
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're
gonna have to give 'em something.

JACKIE
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's
name - I don't really know shit about
what he does or how he does it - That
don't give me much to bargain with.

MAX
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help.
Show a willingness to be helpful. You
want to stay out of jail, don't you?

Max looks at Jackie thinking about something.

MAX (CONT'D)
What'dya think?


CLOSEUP JACKIE

JACKIE
I think maybe I have more options
than I thought.

DISSOLVE TO:


CLOSEUP: ORDELL

Sitting in his black Mercedes, parked across the street
from Jackie's apartment building in Hawthorne. Johnny
Cash is playing inside his car.


EXT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

ORDELL'S POV

Through the windshield, he sees Max's powder-blue
Cadillac Seville pull up to Jackie's apartment. She gets
out, ten bends down and talks to him through the window
of the passenger side door. Then makes a goobye gesture
and turns, walking into her apartment complex. Max drives
off.


ORDELL

While Johnny Cash continues crooning, Ordell puts on his
gloves. Then opens up his glovebox, taking out a little
Targa .22 pistol. He steps out of the car, slipping the
pistol into his coat pocket. We STEDICAM in front of him
as he walks across the street to Jackie's apartment. Once
inside the complex, Ordell passes us and WE FOLLOW BEHIND
HIM, up to Jackie's ground-floor apartment door.

He gives it a soft knock with one knuckle. He waits a
moment, then Jackie opens the door.

ORDELL
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?

JACKIE
I was expecting you. Come in.

Jackie holds the door open for him.


INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ordell steps inside. He moves over by a halogen lamp in
the living room.

ORDELL
You got some booze?

Jackie still standing by the door. She doesn't look
frightened.

JACKIE
I got some vodka in the freezer.

ORDELL
Got some o.j.?

JACKIE
Yeah.

Ordell turns the halogen lamp to dim.

ORDELL
Well, then, why don't you be a good
hostess and make me a screwdriver?

JACKIE
Sure.

Jackie moves into the kitchen area. Ordell follows her,
hanging in the doorway, while she makes the drink. Jackie
doesn't turn on the light.

ORDELL
You gonna thank me?

Taking a glass from the cupboard.

JACKIE
For what?

ORDELL
Who you think got your ass outta
jail?

Opening the freezer and filling a glass with ice cubes
and taking out vodka.

JACKIE
The same guy who put me in, thanks a
lot.

ORDELL
Hey, you get caught with blow, that's
our business.

Opens refrigerator, light cuts into the kitchen. She
takes out orange juice, then closes the door.

JACKIE
It wasn't mine.

Ordell has to stop and think.

Jackie makes screwdriver.

ORDELL
Oh, shit. I bet it was that present
Mr. Walker was sending Melanie.
Yaaaah, he's the one musta put it in
there if you didn't. Oh, man, that
shit's uncalled for, baby, and I
apologize. I 'magine they asked you a
shitload of questions about it, huh?
All that money, want to know where
you got it?

Jackie doesn't answer. She just walks up to Ordell
handing him his yellow drink in the darkness. Ordell
takes it, continues to look at Jackie.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
I'magine they asked who you givin' it
to, too.

JACKIE
They asked.

ORDELL
And what was your answer?

JACKIE
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.

ORDELL
You positive about that? You weren't
nervous and let something slip by
mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I
just gotta know.

Jackie says to his face;

JACKIE
You're not asking the right
questions.

Then she walks past him back to the living room. She goes
over to the halogen lamp, turning the light up brighter,
then moves by the door, still standing and looking at
Ordell in the kitchen doorway.

JACKIE
Beaumont Livingston.

ORDELL
I knew it.

JACKIE
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.

Ordell by the halogen lamp. He turns it back to dim.

ORDELL
Yeah?

JACKIE
I didn't tell 'em anything.

Ordell moves slowly towards Jackie.

ORDELL
My name come up?

Jackie slowly shakes her head "no."

Ordell directly in front of Jackie, he gently places his
gloved hands on her shoulders.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
You say anything about me?

Jackie shakes her head "no."

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Well, that's mighty honorable of you.

Ordell's gloved fingertips move up her collarbone to her
throat, gently touching her skin. Jackie locks eyes with
his, but still shows no fear.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
This fella Beaumont, they say what
happened to him?

JACKIE
They told me.

At this moment the film becomes a:


SPLIT SCREEN

On the RIGHT-HAND SIDE is Ordell with his hands barely
touching Jackie's throat. On the LEFT-HAND SIDE is Max
driving home in his Seville.


MAX IN CAR

Max drives home, an almost moony romantic look no his
face. He can't stop thinking about Jackie. During the
night she'd have a gleam in her eyes, the look saying;
"WE COULD HAVE FUN". Unless she was appraising kinda him
with the look, making a judgment and what it said was; "I
COULD USE YOU". Either way it was a turn-on.

Max pulls into the driveway of his small house in
Torrance.


ORDELL AND JACKIE

ORDELL
Yeah, somebody musta been real mad at
Beaumont. Or  they were afraid of
what he might say to keep from doin
some time. I'magine from time-to-time
they asked you a whole shitload of
questions. And you didn't give 'em no
answer?

Jackie shakes her head from side to side.

Ordell moves his thumbs from her collarbone to the middle
of her throat.

ORDELL
You scared of me?

Jackie shakes her head from side to side without her eyes
leaving his. Reaches over the seat

ORDELL
You got a reason to be nervous with
me?

With his hands on Jackie's throat, staring into the
woman's eyes, from BELOW FRAME then feels something hard
the fuck against his crotch. Neither break eye contact.

Ordell hears a CLICK.

Can't believe it.


MAX IN CAR

Max takes his keys, then to the glove box...


THE GLOVE BOX

The gun is gone.

MAX
Where is it?


A CLOSEUP OF MAX'S GUN IN ORDELL ORDELL'S CROTCH

ORDELL
Is that what I think it is?

JACKIE
What do you think it is?


CLOSEUP GUN IN CROTCH

ORDELL
I think it's a gun pressing against
my dick.

JACKIE
You thought right... Now take your
hands from around my throat, nigga.

Ordell flashes his hustler's smile and lets go.

END OF SPLIT SCREEN

Jackie turns Ordell around, gun firmly in his back, and
pushes him against the wall.

ORDELL
What the hell you doin'?

JACKIE
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!

Jackie has Ordell against the wall and is frisking him
the way a cop would. She finds the .22 pistol in his
pocket

ORDELL
Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do
with you. I just carry that. You been
listenin' to them cops too much.

JACKIE
The cops didn't try and strangle my
ass.

ORDELL
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with
you.

JACKIE
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm
gonna unload both these
motherfuckers, you don't do what I
tell you. Understand what I'm saying?

ORDELL
Baby, I ain't come here -

She shoves both guns in Ordell's back.

JACKIE
I said, you understand what I'm
saying

ORDELL
I understand woman, damn!

JACKIE
Go sit over in that chair.

Ordell moves over to a chair across from the couch.
Ordell still tries bullshit...

ORDELL
I'm tellin' you, those cops been
fuckin' wit your mind. They turn
black against black, that's how they
do.

JACKIE
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit
down.

Ordell sits.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Put both hands behind our head.

Ordell does...

ORDELL
This shits gettin silly now...

Jackie turns the halogen lamp to light.

JACKIE
I gotta tell you to shut up one more
time, I'm gonna shut you up.

Jackie sits down on the couch, holding a gun in each
hand, both pointed dead at Ordell.

A coffee table lays between them.

Ordell, hands behind his head, continues to mumble...

ORDELL
I just came here to talk.

JACKIE
Way I see it, me and you only got one
thing to talk about. What you willing
to do for me?

Ordell looks at her a moment and says;

ORDELL
Well, I can get you a good lawyer -

Jackie shakes her head "no!"

JACKIE
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or
later they're gonna get around to
offering me a plea deal, and you know
that. That's why you came here to
kill me.

ORDELL
- Baby, I didn't -

JACKIE
- It's okay. I forgive you. Now,
let's say if I tell on you, I walk.
And if I don't, I go to jail.

Ordell, very interested.

ORDELL
Yeah?

JACKIE
One hundred thousand put in an escrow
account in my name, if I'm convicted
up to a year, or put on probation. If
I have to do more than a year, you
pay another hundred thousand.

Ordell just takes in what the woman said.

ORDELL
I got a problem...

JACKIE
All your money's in Mexico.

Ordell has to smile at the woman.

ORDELL
Yeah.

JACKIE
I been thinkin about that, too, and I
got me a idea.

TIME CUT:


DOORWAY

Ordell goes through FRAME, out the door, Jackie steps
into FRAME, and talks with him.

JACKIE
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and
tell you if it's on.

ORDELL (O.S.)
Talk to you tomorrow.

Ordell leaves.

Jackie shuts the door, and leaves FRAME.

FADE TO BLACK


OVER BLACK

We hear a knock-knock on the door.

FADE UP ON:


SAME SHOT DORWAY

Except it's day. Jackie in a bathrobe steps into FRAME
and opens the door. She says to the yet-unseen-by-camera
visitor;

JACKIE
You want your gun, don't you? Come
in. I'll go get it.

She leaves FRAME, and Max enters it, closing the door
behind him. Max stands by the door, a little surprised
and a touch pissed at the nonchalantness.

As he stands on the threshold to her living room, waiting
for her to return with the gun, feeling foolish, he
thinks about hauling her ass back to the stockade.
That'll change her expression, he'd bet.

She returns from the bedroom, gun in hand, wearing a sort
of sad smile.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Max, I'm sorry. I was afraid if I
asked to borrow it you'd say no.
You'd have to. Would you like some
coffee?

Then, as quickly as the anger rose in Max, it dissipates
completely, leaving only curiosity.

MAX
If you're having some.

JACKIE
I am. Have a seat.

Jackie head to the kitchen, making the coffee. Max sits
at the dining table off of the kitchen.

MAX
You get a chance to use it?

JACKIE
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk
went bad when I was in jail.

MAX
Black's fine.

She puts a finger in the coffeemaker and starts scooping
coffee in it.

MAX (CONT'D)
You want to hang on to it awhile? It
wouldn't be legal, but if it makes -

Jackie goes to the sink, filling the coffee pot.

JACKIE
Thanks, but I have my own now.

MAX
You went out this morning and bought
a gun?

She turns off the water.

JACKIE
What, I couldn't hear you?

MAX
You went out this morning and bought
a gun.

Pouring water into the coffee machine.

JACKIE
Let's just say I got one, okay?

She turns on the coffeemaker.

MAX
Somebody loan it to you?

JACKIE
Yeah.

Jackie leaves the kitchen.

Max's eyes follow her to the living room.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Want to hear some music?

MAX
Sure.

Jackie ends her knees and goes through a stack of records
leaned up against the wall on the floor.

JACKIE
I couldn't wait till I got home last
night and wash my hair.

MAX
It looks nice.

She finds a record, takes it out of the pile, removes the
album from the sleeve, and places it on her stereo
turntable.

MAX (CONT'D)
You never got into the whole CD
revolution?

JACKIE
I got a few. But I can't afford to
start all over again. I got too much
time and money invested in my
records.

The song starts; it's an old romantic soul music number
from the early seventies.

MAX
Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on
records.

Jackie picks up her cigarettes off the coffee table.

JACKIE
I don't buy new stuff that often.

Jackie enters the kitchen door frame by Max. She lights a
cigarette and stands.

Max listens to the soul song.

MAX
This is pretty.

JACKIE
Uh-huh.

MAX
Who is this?

JACKIE
The Delfonics.

MAX
'76?

JACKIE
'74, I think.

MAX
It's nice.

They listen for a moment.

JACKIE
I called in sick this morning. As far
as the airline knows, I'm still
available.

MAX
Are you?

JACKIE
I don't know yet. 'm going to talk
with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do
what you suggested. Offer to help and
see what happens.

MAX
What I meant was have a lawyer do the
negotiating for you.

JACKIE
I want to talk to them first. I know
more now about Ordell's money.

MAX
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one
who wants you, that'll only interest
him up to a point.

JACKIE
It's a lot of money. About a half-a-
million dollars. All of it in Cabo in
safe deposit boxes and more comin in.

MAX
How'd you find that out?

JACKIE
He told me last night.

MAX
He called you?

JACKIE
He came by.

MAX
What?... What'd you do?

JACKIE
We talked.

Jackie goes back in the kitchen. Coffee's almost there,
but not quite. She pulls down two mugs from a cabinet.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
He had his doubts at first. But he's
always trusted me an wants more than
anything to believe he still can.

MAX
Why?

JACKIE
He needs me. Without me all that
money is just gonna sit over there in
Cabo. Sugar?

MAX
No thanks. There's gotta be other
ways to get it out.

She pours the coffee.

JACKIE
Maybe, but 'm the only one he's ever
used. He can't trust his other
people. They're crooks. He can try
bringing I in himself, but Ordell
sure don't want to go through no
Customs line. Either he recruits
another Cabo stewardess, or he
continues to trust me. I made him
feel he still can.

Jackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and
sits down.

MAX
How do you get it out?

JACKIE
Same way I been don', but first they
got to let me go back to work.

MAX
You're gonna offer to set him up?

JACKIE
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck
'em.

MAX
It's very possible Ordell's killed
somebody.

JACKIE
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't
doin' that probation thing again.

Max watches her a moment

Jackie takes a drink of coffee.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
How do you feel about getting old?

MAX
You're not old. You look great.

JACKIE
I'm asking how you feel. Does it
bother you?

MAX
It's not really something I think
about.

JACKIE
Really?

MAX
Okay, I'm a little sensitive about my
hair. It started falling out ten
years ago. So I did something about
it.

JACKIE
How'd you feel about it?

MAX
I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of
done it, I did it to feel better
about myself, and I do. When I look
in the mirror it looks like me.

JACKIE
It's different with men.

MAX
You know, I can't really feel too
sorry for you in that department.

Jackie smiles.

MAX (CONT'D)
In fact, I'd make a bet that except
possibly for an Afro - you look
exactly the same as you did at twenty
nine.

Jackie smiles into her coffee.

JACKIE
My ass ain't the same.

MAX
Bigger?

JACKIE
Yeah.

Max smiles.

MAX
Nothin wrong with that.

Jackie's smile grows bigger.

MAX (CONT'D)
Does something else worry you?

JACKIE
I just feel like I'm always starting
over. You said how many bonds you
wrote?

MAX
Fifteen thousand.

JACKIE
Well, I've flown seven million miles.
And I've been waitin' on people
almost twenty years. The best job I
could get after my bust was Cabo Air,
which is about the worst job you can
get in this industry. I make about
sixteen thousand, with retirement
benefits , ain't worth a damn. And
now with this arrest hanging over my
head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I
gotta start all over again, but I got
nothin to start over with. I'll be
stuck with whatever I can get. And
that scares me more than Ordell.

DISSOLVE TO:


INT. LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

A.T.F. man, Ray Nicolet, moves down the hallway of the
big building... ten heads for the office of Mark Dargus.

He reaches the closed door... raps on it.

DARGUS (O.S.)
Come in.

Nicolet opens the door, revealing Dargus and Jackie Brown
sitting in the office talking.

DARGUS (CONT'D)
Great, you're here.

NICOLET
Hey, Jackie.

Jackie waves.

Dargus stands up and says to Jackie;

DARGUS
Let me have a word outside with Agent
Nicolet for a moment?

JACKIE
Take your time.

DARGUS
Thanks.

NICOLET
Well just be a minute.

JACKIE
Can I smoke?

DARGUS
Go ahead.

The two detectives step outside and close the door on
Jackie as she pulls out her cigarettes.

NICOLET
What's going on?

DARGUS
She wants to make a deal.

NICOLET
She sound scared?

DARGUS
She almost sounds scared.

NICOLET
What's she want?

DARGUS
She wants to go back to work.

NICOLET
What's she willing to give us?

DARGUS
She hasn't one into specifics yet,
she's been waiting for you.

NICOLET
She knows it's my case?

DARGUS
She ain't said it, but she's not
stupid, she knows it's you who wants
her.


CLOSEUP JACKIE

Inside Dargus' office, smoking a Mild Seven.

Dargus and Nicolet come back inside.

NICOLET
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell
me, what can we do for you?

JACKIE
I need permission to leave the
country so I keep my job.

NICOLET
We can look into that.

JACKIE
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show
up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.

NICOLET
You know what we want.

JACKIE
If I'm working, I can help you.

DARGUS
Help us do what?

JACKIE
Help you get Ordell Robbie.

NICOLET
Oh, so now you know him?

JACKIE
You never asked me if I did or not.

DARGUS
But now you're telling us now you do.

JACKIE
'Course I do - I deliver money for
him.

NICOLET
No shit. You know how he makes hi
money?

JACKIE
He sells guns.

NICOLET
You ever see him sell guns?

JACKIE
No.

NICOLET
Then how do you know he sells guns?

JACKIE
He told me. Besides, why else would
an A.T.F. man be after him?

NICOLET
How can you help us?

JACKIE
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do
everything I can to help you throw
his ass in jail. And in exchange for
my help, I need permission to leave
the country and immunity.

DARGUS
You don't want much, do you?

JACKIE
Can you do it or not?

The two cops look at each other.

DARGUS
(to Nicolet)
It's your call.

Nicolet looks at Jackie.

NICOLE
It's possible.

FADE TO BLACK


TITLE CARD:

"LOUIS GARA   MELANIE"

CUT TO:


FADE UP ON ON TV

Helmut Berger slaps a woman in the face with a newspaper,
proclaiming he's the "mad dog." The film is an Italian
Policier from the seventies.

Melanie sits in a comfy chair long-ways, bare legs
hanging over the arm. As she watches the TV, she picks up
a big bong with it's own handle. He takes a hit.
Melanie's dressed in her usual Melanie-uniform of shorts
and a loose top.

The front door opens, and Ordell and Louis walk through
it carrying shopping bags.

ORDELL
We're back.

MELANIE
'Ola!

We notice that Louis is sportin' new duds. Louis' new
"look" is a retro seventies-style bowling shirt and black
jeans.

Melanie notices the change.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got
some new clothes.

ORDELL
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy
running around lookin' like a bum on
the street.

LOUIS
I didn't look like a bum.

ORDELL
But you did have a Salvation Army-
thing going.

Ordell notices the bong in her hand and the smoke in the
air.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Goddam, girl. You gettin' high
already. It's only two o'clock.

Melanie smiles.

MELANIE
It's that late?

Louis sits on the couch. He smiles at the comeback.

ORDELL
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too
much of that shit. That shit robs you
of your ambition.

MELANIE
Not if your ambition is to get high
and watch TV.

Melanie and Louis laugh.

The phone rings.

ORDELL
You two a coupla Cheech and Chongs,
ain't ya.
(he moves towards the
phone - to Melanie)
Oh, that's okay, I'll get it.

He picks it up.

ORDELL
Hello.
(pause)
Hey, Jackie...
(throwing a hard look at
Melanie)

No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.

MELANIE
I was gonna tell you...

Ordell gives her a "silence" gesture and look.

Melanie trades a look with Louis like "I'm in trouble,"
all the while smiling like a shark.

Louis smiles to himself.

Melanie holds up the bong, offering him a hit.

Ordell's on the phone.

ORDELL
No, not on the phone, let's meet
somewhere. But you gotta make sure
they ain't followin' you...

Louis has the bong in front of him.

Melanie stays in her chair long-ways.

LOUIS
Is it ready to go?

MELANIE
Yeah, there's another hit left.

Louis takes it.

Ordell's on the phone.


INT. COCKATOO INN

Jackie sits at the bar talking on their phone. We see
both sides.

JACKIE
The Cockatoo Inn.

ORDELL
The Cockatoo Inn? Where's that?

JACKIE
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and
Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red
brick...

ORDELL
Oh, wait, you mean that place that
has the big sign with a rooster on
it?

JACKIE
It's a cockatoo.

Louis exhales his smoke, does an older man cough.

MELANIE
You okay?

LOUIS
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't
smoke or laugh now it seems without
coughing.

MELANIE
Coughing opens up the capillaries.
When you cough, you're getting air -
in this case smoke - to parts of the
lung that don't normally get used.
Coughing's good - gets ya higher. My
dad coughs when he smokes all the
time.

Ordell hangs up the phone.

ORDELL
(to Louis)
Hey, Louis, I have to go out awhile.
So since you like gettin' high so
much, why don't you stay here with
Melanie, get high, and watch
cartoons?

Louis with a smile.

LOUIS
Way ahead of you.

Melanie laughs.

Ordell takes the remote control and turns the station
till he finds a channel with cartoons.

ORDELL
So you just watch this for the next
three hours, and I'll be back. Then,
when I'm through with all my
business, I'll get high. I get high
at night. Walk me to the door, space
girl.

Melanie climbs out of the chair and walks Ordell to the
door,

Ordell says to her in the doorway;

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Hope you don't mind keeping him
company.

MELANIE
No problem.

ORDELL
Try not to rip his clothes off 'em
they're new.

Melanie gives him a sarcastic, "Oh, you're so funny"
look.

Ordell kisses her quick on the mouth, then says past her;

ORDELL (CONT'D)
I'll be back in an hour, man. Just
hang with Mel.

Ordell leaves and Melanie closes the door. She turns
around and looks at Louis.

MELANIE
Want a Metrix?

LOUIS
What's a Metrix?

She crosses to the kitchen.

MELANIE
It's like this major meal in a shake
you drink instead of having a big
meal.

LOUIS
It's a diet thing?

MELANIE
No, it's what body builders drink to
beef up.

LOUIS
No thanks.

She goes into the kitchen and starts making her Metrix
shake.

He looks around and spots something interesting.


TWO SMALL PHOTOGRAPHS

In a clear, plastic frame. Melanie, circa 1976, at about
sixteen wearing roller-disco skates. Melanie, in a green
setting, about five years ago, wearing a pretty Oriental-
style dress, with a "smile for the camera" look on her
face. The photo was obviously a picture of Melanie with
somebody else that's been cut in half. Somebody's
disembodied arm still rests on her shoulder.

Louis picks up the photo frame.

LOUIS
How old were you here?

She looks and sees what he's talking about.

MELANIE
Which one?

LOUIS
The roller disco one.

MELANIE
Fourteen.

Louis walks over.

LOUIS
You're fourteen years old here?

MELANIE
Yeah.

LOUIS
I thought you were sixteen.

MELANIE
I was pretty much the same height now
as I was then.

LOUIS
Were you a disco girl?

MELANIE
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides,
I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to
discos.

LOUIS
So where did you go?

MELANIE
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at
a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S.
girl. I hated disco.

She hits Whip on her blender. It makes an infernal noise
till she hits Stop!

Carrying the blender full of Metrix, she walks over and
looks at the picture.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
That was taken at a place called
"Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were
you in L.A. back then?

LOUIS
No.

MELANIE
Where were you?

LOUIS
Detroit.

MELANIE
With Ordell?

LOUIS
We had done time together already.

Melanie drinks her Metrix.

MELANIE
Were you a disco guy?

LOUIS
No.

MELANIE
C'mon, don't lie.

LOUIS
I don't like dancing.

MELANIE
Did you ever go I one?

LOUIS
I went to a few just to meet women.
But I don't like to dance, and it's
so fuckin; loud. During that whole
scene I just drank in bars.
(he points to the cut
picture)
Who didn't make the cut?

MELANIE
That's a picture of me in Japan.

LOUIS
You been to Japan?

MELANIE
I lived there for about nine months.

LOUIS
You lived in Japan, when?

MELANIE
About five years ago.

LOUIS
Who's arm is that?

MELANIE
That's the guy I lived with... his
name was... Hir.Hirosh.

LOUIS
Must of made quite an impression.

MEALINE
I never got to know him, really. I
couldn't speak Japanese, and his
English was terrible. But I couldn't
say anything, because his English was
better than my Japanese.

LOUIS
That sounds like a problem.

MELANIE
Not really. We didn't have much to
say to each other anyway. I never got
to know him that well, but I knew
enough to know I wasn't missing much.
I keep that, because of all the
fuckin' time I was there, that's the
only picture I got of me in Japan.
(she points beyond her

FADE UP:


LOUIS

Lies on the couch on his back and Melanie sits on top of
him. They're going at it like a couple of fuck monkeys.
Almost on the fade up, Louis cums.

MELANIE
That was fun.

She hops off and OUT OF FRAME.

LOUIS
Yeah, that really hit the spot.

MELANIE (O.S.)
Now that's over, let's get to know
each other.


INT. MUSIC STORE - DAY

CLOSEUP a rack of CDs all beginning with "D" are flipped
through, till it stops on one CD, "The Best of the
DELFONICS."

Max is standing in he soul music section o a music store.
He lifts out the CD and turns it over.

It has the song Jackie played this morning.

He smiles and takes the CD up to the register.

CLOSEUP the COCKATOO INN neon sign, unlit during the day.


INT. THE COCKATOO INN - DAY

Ordell walks into the dark red cocktail lounge in the
middle of the day and sees Jackie sitting at the bar
drinking a white wine. Old-school soul plays on the
jukebox. He sits next to her.

ORDELL
I gotta remember this place. This is
all right. Two minutes from your
crib, ten minutes from your work. Not
bad...

A black bartender named FLOYD approaches Ordell.

FLOYD
What's your drink, brother?

ORDELL
Screwdriver.

FLOYD
(to Jackie)
How you doin'?

JACKIE
I'm fine.

FLOYD
Yes, you are.

Jackie smiles.

Floyd makes Ordell's drink.

ORDELL
I bet you come here on a Saturday
night, you need nigga repellent keep
'em off your ass.

JACKIE
I do okay.

ORDELL
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I
bet you do a damn sight better than
okay. You think anybody followed you?

JACKIE
I don't think so, but it don't really
matter. They know I'm meeting you.

ORDELL
How the fuck they know that?

JACKIE
I told them.

Floyd comes back with Ordell's screwdriver.

FLOYD
Three twenty-five.

Ordell digs in his pocket and gives Floyd a five.

ORDELL
Keep it.

FLOYD
Thank you, sir.

Floyd leaves.

ORDELL
(to Jackie)
You told em? You told em it's me?

JACKIE
They already know it's you.

ORDELL
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta
confirm it!

JACKIE
Look, the only way I can get
permission to fly is if I agree to
help them. Which is what I have to
appear to be doing. So I give them
something they already know. You.

ORDELL
Didja tell 'em anything else?

JACKIE
I told them you got a half a million
dollars in Mexico, and you want me to
bring it here.

Ordell freaks.

ORDELL
You told them that?

JACKIE
It's true, isn't it?

ORDELL
What the fuck's that got to do with
it?

JACKIE
They know I'm delivering for you. I
mention the half-million - they don't
give a fuck about that - They want
you with guns. So I say, well, if you
want proof he's getting paid for
selling them, let me bring the money
in.

ORDELL
What did they say?

Jackie smiles.

JACKIE
Yes.

Ordell smiles.

They both slap palms.

CUT TO:


INT. MELANIE'S BEACH APARTMENT - DAY

CLOSEUP - Louis taking a hit off Melanie's bong.

Louis and Melanie are back in the living room, kicking
back, taking bong hits.

As Louis gets his hit, Melanie talks;

MELANI
... so first he tries to get into the
cocaine business but realizes right
away that shit's too competitive.
Piss the wrong person off, you get
shot. So he says, fuck that - moves
over to guns. You can sell guns
wherever there's a demand. No one
gives a shit. He acts like he's this
big international arms dealer, when,
come on, the only people he ever sold
to were dopers.

Louis finishes his hit and slides the bong back across
the coffee table to Melanie.

LOUIS
He seems to be making out.

Referring to the bong.

MELANIE
Is it dead?

LOUIS
Yeah.

She starts preparing a bowl.

MELANIE
Well, so far he is. But you have to
admit he's not too bright.

LOUIS
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.

Melanie still preparing her bowl.

MELANIE
He moves his lips when he reads, what
does that tell ya. Let's say he's
streetwise. I'll give 'im that. He's
still a fuck-up.

She takes a major bong hit... holds in the smoke... then
while holding in the smoke, says;

MELANIE (CONT'D)
He killed a man worked for him the
other night.

LOUIS
So what are you trying to tell me? I
should get out of here?

Melanie lets out her stream of smoke and flashes her
shark smile.

MELANIE
That's not what I'm saying at all.
(pause) You know where he went?

LOUIS
No.

MELANIE
He went to meet that stewardess.

LOUIS
Does that bother you?

Melanie lets out a sarcastic laugh.

MELANIE
Please.

LOUIS
You live with him.

MELANIE
I live here. He drops in and out. He
tell you about that half-million
dollars he's got in Mexico?

LOUIS
Uh-huh?

MELANIE
Course he did, he tells everybody
who'll listen. That's what he's doin'
with this stewardess. He's scheming
how he can get it over here.

LOUIS
And your point is?

MELANIE
Let him and that stewardess get that
money over here...

LOUIS
Uh-huh?

MELANI
... and just take it from him.


INT. COCKATOO INN - DAY

Jackie explaining the plan to Ordell.

JACKI
... I make two deliveries. The first
one with ten thousand, like a dry
run. They watch it. See how it works.
Then we do a second delivery, when I
bring in the half mill.

ORDELL
Naw, naw, that's too much exposure. I
ain't goin anywhere near that money.

JACKIE
You don't have to. I told 'em you're
real careful. You never pick up money
yourself. You always send someone,
and I never know who it is.

ORDELL
That's a good idea.

JACKIE
If you just listen, you'll see it's a
damn good idea. The first time I do
it they're lurking about. They see me
hand the ten thousand to someone.

ORDELL
Who?

JACKIE
I don't know. One of your friends.

ORDELL
A woman.

JACKIE
If you want.

ORDELL
Yeah, I think a woman.

JACKIE
The next trip, when I come with all
the money, it'll look like I hand it
to the same one I did before...

ORDELL
But you don't?

JACKIE
No, I give it to someone else first.

ORDELL
And they follow the wrong one
thinkin' she's bringing it to me.

JACKIE
That's the idea.

ORDELL
So we need two people, two women.

JACKIE
Can you cover that?

ORDELL
I got the woman covered. Where you
thinkin' about doin' this?

JACKIE
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In
the food court.

ORDELL
I suppose you see a piece of this for
yourself?

JACKIE
Well, it's my plan. We're in this
together.

ORDELL
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't
need me a partner.

JACKIE
I ain't your partner, I'm your
manager. I'm managing to get your
money out of Mexico, into America, in
your hands, and I'm managing to do
all this under the nose of the cops.
That makes me your manager, and
managers get fifteen percent.

ORDELL
Managers get ten percent.

JACKIE
That's an agent. Manager's get
fifteen percent.

ORDELL
I'll give ya ten.

JACKIE
Plus the same deal as before.

ORDELL
I can do that.

They clink their glasses together.


CLOSEUP DIGITAL CLOCK

It flips to 11:00 P.M.

It's now getting late at night. Jackie comes home. She's
dressed differently than she was at the Cockatoo. In
fact, she looks like she's coming home from a date.

She walks into her bedroom... kicks off her shoes...
takes her earring off, putting them on the night-stand by
the bed... she sees that her answering machine is
flashing. She hits play.

We begin a SLOW ZOOM into the answering machine. Never
seeing Jackie again.

The machine voice says;

MACHINE VOICE (O.S.)
You have on message. Sent at 8:06
P.M.

Max's voice comes out of the machine.

MAX'S VOICE (O.S.)
Hi, Jackie. It's Max. I was just
calling to find out how everything
went today with A.T.F. If you want to
call me, my home number is 555-6788,
or you can reach me at my office,
which is 555-B-A-I-L. That's also on
the card I gave you when we first met
- I don't know if you still have that
- but it's on it - Oh, let me give
you my beeper number. It's 555-7839.
Okay, so I'll talk to you later. Hope
everything's well. Bye-bye.

FADE UP ON:


EXT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY

We se the huge Del Amo Mall from the parking area.

A SUBTITLE reads:

"DEL AMO MALL TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA LARGEST INDOOR MALL IN
THE WORLD"


INT. DEL AMO MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY

The Del Amo Mall on a lazy midday in the middle of the
week. A few people, mostly black, mill around, but it's
not like it is on the weekend.

The international food court, where fast-food versions of
international cuisine are available to all the hungry Del
Amo Mall shoppers.

Jackie and Ordell sit at a table in the food court. She
drinks an iced tea from Teriyaki Donut. A collection of
Broadway shopping bags sit on the table.

We join in mid-conversation.

JACKIE
The money's in a Broadway shopping
bag. I get some food, and sit down
here in the food court. Then your
girl comes - you got somebody yet?

ORDELL
Uh-huh.

JACKIE
Who?

ORDELL
What'd you care?

JACKIE
Look, it's my ass facin' the
penitentiary. You send some hard-
headed roc whore, and she fucks
things up.

ORDELL
I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The
woman's cool, I promise.


INT. DEL AMO MALL - U.A. CINEMAS - DAY

We're outside the Del Amo UA Cinemas, a six-screen
theater that's been in the Del Amo Mall since the early
seventies. A small afternoon crowd is exiting the cinema,
having just watched their matinee. Max Cherry is among
them. He exits the theater, and strolls through the mall.


BACK TO JACKIE AND ORDELL

In the food court.

Ordell rises from the table.

Jackie moves a Broadway bag towards him.

JACKIE
Don't forget your bag.

He takes it.

We follow with Ordell out of the food court, when he
stops...

... He see Max Cherry strolling through the mall.

Ordell almost steps into a store to get out of view.
"What the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?"

As Ordell watches, he sees Max head towards the food
court.

MAX
walks into the food court. He stands
looking a all the international fast
food choices in front of him. As he
tries to decide, he hears from behind
him;

JACKIE (O.S.)
Max.

Max turns and sees Jackie siting there drinking her iced
tea, smoking her Mild Seven, and smiling up at him.

Max smiles back.

MAX
Well, hello.

JACKIE
Surprise.

He approaches her table.

MAX
I walked right past you.

JACKIE
I know, ignoring me. What're you up
to?

MAX
Catching a movie.

JACKIE
What'd ya see?

MAX
"American Prseident"

JACKIE
How was it?

MAX
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening
are goin steady.

JACKIE
Oh, are you? Does she know that?

MAX
No...
(sitting down at the
table)
... I don't believe she's ever heard
of me. But that doesn't mean we're
not going steady.


BACK TO ORDELL

Watching Max sit down and make himself comfortable at
Jackie's table.

ORDELL
(to himself)
What's up with this shit.


BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE

MAX
I think falling in live with movie
stars is something that happens to a
man as he gets older.

JACKIE
Does it happen to all men?

MAX
Well, I'd never be so bold as to
speak for all men, but as or myself
and a few of my friends, that's
definitely the case. There's a lot of
actresses out there you like, and
there's some you have crushes on. But
there's always one who you love. And
with her it's sorta like going
steady.

JACKIE
And Annette's it for you?

MAX
For now. These relationships never
last too long.

With a smile on her face;

JACKIE
That's a goddam man for ya. Can't
even be faithful to a fuckin' movie
star.

Max smiles.

JACKIE
Who was your girl before Annette?

MAX
Sandra Bullock. You know her?

JACKIE
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the
bus in "Speed." She's cute.

MAX
She's adorable. But I had to end it.

JACKIE
Why?

MAX
I'm old enough to be her father.

JACKIE
How old's Annette?

MAX
I don't care.

Gesturing to the Broadway bags on the table.

MAX
What're you, a bag lady?

JACKIE
I go back to work tomorrow.

MAX
You talk them into it?

JACKIE
They seem to like the idea.

MAX
Bring the money in and they follow
it?

JACKIE
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up.
Put the money in a shopping bag and
hand it to someone I meet here.

MAX
You don't actually do it that way?

JACKIE
He always just picked it up at my
place. But with A.T.F. involved, I
want to stage it. You know, make it
look more intriguing, like we know
what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's
up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T. F. guy to
follow the shopping bag.

MAX
Make the delivery somewhere in the
mall.

JACKIE
Right around here, in the food court.

MAX
Sit down, leave the bag under the
table?

Jackie nods her head "yes."

MAX (CONT'D)
Will Ordell go for that?

JACKIE
I'm helping him bring his money into
America. He loves the idea. You just
missed him.

MAX
He was here?

JACKIE
Yeah, we were goin' over everything.
That's why all the bags.

MAX
I called you last night.

JACKIE
I know, I got your message. Ray
wanted to have dinner. He wanted to
talk about the sting we're plotting.
That's what he calls it. A sting.
He's being real nice to me.

MAX
You think he's got a thing for you?

JACKIE
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be
something like he wants the money for
himself.

MAX
I don't follow your logic. What does
his being nice to you have to do with
him wanting Ordell's money?

JACKIE
He's setting me up to make a
proposition.

MAX
I see.

JACKIE
You don't propose something like that
unless you're pretty sure the other
person's into it.

MAX
Has he hinted around?

JACKIE
Not really. But I knew this narcotics
cop one time. Told me that in a raid,
the whole package never gets back to
the station. His exact words.

MAX
You know some interesting people.

JACKIE
We weren't bullshittin' either,
'cause later he was suspended and
forced to retire.

MAX
Has Nicolet told you any colorful
stories like that?

She shakes her head "no."

JACKIE
He tries to act cool.

MAX
No harm in that. He's a young guy
havin' fun being a cop. I know the
type, trust me on this. He's more
interested in Ordell than the money.
If he's gonna do anything suspect,
it'll be cutting corners to get the
conviction; but he wouldn't walk off
with the money. It's evidence.

JACKIE
What about you Max?

MAX
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?

JACKIE
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you
were somebody else.

MAX
If I saw a way to walk off with a
shopping bag full of money, would I
take it?

JACKIE
You know where it came from. It's not
like it's anybody's life savings. It
wouldn't even be missed.

MAX
A half-a-million dollars will always
be missed.

JACKIE
You're avoiding the question.

MAX
Okay, sure. I might be tempted.
Especially now, since I'm getting out
of the bail bonds business.

Jackie looks at him, "wow, that was a statement," but she
doesn't say anything.

Max continues.

MAX
I have to stand behind all my active
bonds, but I'm not writing any new
ones.

JACKIE
Why?

MAX
A lot of reasons. But the main one
would be I'm tired of it.

JACKIE
When did you decide?

MAX
It's been a long time coming. I
finally made up my mind - I guess it
was Thursday.

FLASH ON:


A RELEASE FORM

With a date on it. Jackie's hand is signing her name. We
WHIP UP and se her face, just as Max Cherry approaches
her, handing her his business card.

MAX
Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail
bondsman.


BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE

JACKIE
The day you got me out of jail?

MAX
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a
guy. I hear he's staying at this
house, so I sneak in, wait for him to
come home.

JACKIE
Wait a minute. After we were together
you went and snuck into a guy's
house?

MAX
Uh-huh.


FLASH ON

Max is dropping off Jackie at her apartment and saying
goodbye.

MAX (V.O.)
I dropped you off...

Max finding no gun in his glove box.

MAX (V.O.)
Went to my office, found out you took
my gun...

Max in his office, taking another pistol from his drawer,
and a stun gun.

MAX (V.O.)
Got another gun and a stun gun...


BACK TO MAX AND JACKIE

MAX
And went to this guy's house in El
Monte, and I waited for him.

JACKIE
What do you do when he comes home?

MAX
Shoot him with the stun gun. While
he's incapacitated, cuff him, take
'em to County.

JACKIE
You do that?

MAX
That's my job.

JACKIE
Did you do it that night?

MAX
He never came home. But I'm sitting
on the couch, in the dark, holding my
stun gun and the whole house smells
of mildew - So after a couple hours I
think, "What am I doing here?
Nineteen years of this shit? So I
made up my mind, that's it.

JACKIE
And is that it?

MAX
More or less.

Jackie takes a pause before saying;

JACKIE
I'm not sure you answered my
question.

MAX
Which one?

JACKIE
If you had a chance, unemployed now,
to walk off with a half-million
dollars, would you take it?

MAX
I believe I said I'd be tempted.

Jackie smiles at him behind cigarette smoke.

MAX
Don't even think about it. You could
get yourself killed go to prison...


CLOSEUP JACKIE

JACKIE
What if I've figured a way?

Hold for a few beats, then...

INT. LAX PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY

Jackie, wearing her stewardess uniform, walks into the
LAX parking structure, pulling her bad on wheels behind
her.

Nicolet and Dargus are waiting for her.

NICOLET
We gotta stop meeting this way.

Jackie smiles. They all fall in step towards Jackie's
Honda.


INT. JACKIE'S HONDA - DAY

The two cops and the black woman sit parked in her Honda.
She, behind the wheel, Nicolet next to her in the
passenger seat, Dargus in the backseat. Nicolet has the
flight bag in his lap. He's taking out the manila
envelope with the ten thousand inside. Their demeanor is
very different from the first time they met. The three
now almost act like friends.

DARGUS
How was your flight?

JACKIE
Fine.

DARGUS
Bet you're happy to be working again.

NICOLET
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet,
Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money
exchange trial run. It's three p.m.,
July 4th 1997. The location is the
parking structure at LAX.

JACKIE
What are you doing?

Pointing to a small mike on his lapel.

NICOLET
I'm recording this.

JACKIE
I thought you were going to let this
one through.

DARGUS
We are. Don't worry about it.

NICOLET
Every step of this goes in my report.
(back to report voice)
I am now taking a manila envelope
from the subject's flight bag.

He opens it and takes out the ten thousand dollars.

NICOLET (CONT'D)
The envelope contains currency... all
the same denomination, one-hundred-
dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.

DARGUS
What time do you have to be there?

JACKIE
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.

DARGUS
What's her name?

JACKIE
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow
her?

DARGUS
She leaves, somebody'll be on her.

JACKIE
But you're not going to stop her?

Nicolet finishes counting, then hushes them up.

NICOLET
The envelope contains ten thousand
dollars. The subject will be
delivering the currency in a...

JACKIE
A Broadway shopping bag.

She holds it up.

NICOLET
A Broadway shopping bag. A large bag
with handles and brown lettering.


EXT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY

The huge Del Amo Mall.


INT. DEL AMO MALL - FOOD COURT - DAY

The Del Amo Mall on another lazy midday in the middle of
the week.

Max rides up an escalator in the mall. He casually
strolls through the mall, goes into a cappuccino bar
called "BUSTA CAP" across from the food court. Walking up
to the counter;

MAX
Caf  mocha.

BUSTA CAP GIRL
You want whipped cream on that?

MAX
No, thanks.

Max checks his watch: 4:30. He looks over at the food
court and spots Jackie sitting at a table by herself.

FLASH ON:


INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jackie on the phone with Max, dressed for bed (long t-
shirt and panties).

JACKIE
Think of it as money that shouldn't
even be here. I mean does anybody
have a right to it?


INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT

Max in his office on the phone.

MAX
The feds. It's evidence.

JACKIE
It may be evidence once they get
their hands on it, but right now it's
only money.


BACK TO MAX AT THE MALL

He ponders his words as he watches her from a distance.


INT. FOOD COURT - DAY

Jackie sits at a table by herself, eating Japanese food
from Teriyaki Donut and drinking an iced tea. As she eats
she hears;

YOUNG GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
Is this seat taken?

Jackie looks up and sees a skinny YOUNG GIRL, black,
quite pretty, no older than twenty.

She holds a tray filled with tacos, enchiladas, rice and
beans and a giant-sized Coke. She also has a Broadway
shopping bag hanging from her arm.

JACKIE
Have a seat.

The Young Girl does.

Jackie looks at her tray of food.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
You're hungry?

YOUNG GIRL
Yes'm.

It would seem our Young Girl's from the South.

JACKIE
Put your bag on the floor, okay?
Under the table, right next to mine.

The Young Girl who hasn't looked right at Jackie since
sitting down, bends sideways to glance under the table.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Then when I leave, well, you know.
What's your name?

She looks up...

YOUNG GIRL
Sherona?

... then back down at her tray.

JACKIE
Go ahead, start eating.

Sheronda starts eating, head down, hunching close to the
tray.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Would it bother you if I smoked?

Without raising her head, she shakes it from side to
side.

Jackie takes out a pack of Davidoffs and lights one up
with her yellow Bic. As she does this she observes
Sheronda eating.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Sheronda, can I ask you a question?
Are you and Ordell married?

Without raising her head.

SHERONDA
He say we like the same thing as
married.

JACKIE
Do you live together?

Sheronda hesitates, then says without raising her head.

SHERONDA
Most of the times.

JACKIE
Not every day?

Sheronda looks up at her...

SHERONDA
Sometimes every day, for a while.

JACKIE
Then you don't see him for a few
days?

... She looks back down.

SHERONDA
Yes'm.

JACKIE
You know what's in the bag you're
taking?

SHERONDA
He say is a surprise.

JACKIE
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking
to you.

Jackie picks up Sheronda's bag and leaves.


INT. DEL AMO MALL - BUSTA CAP - DAY

Max drinking his caf  mocha sans whipped cream, watches
Jackie leave the Young Girl and with Broadway bag in
hand, walk out of the food court.

Max watches her walk down the mall when two young men in
sport coats, jeans, and cowboy boots step out of a B.
Dalton bookstore, stop her and begin talking. Knowing
they must be Nicolet and Dargus, he watches one of them
take the Broadway bag from Jackie and look inside. They
talk for a minute - it would seem about nothing too
serious. Jackie nods her head, listens to the two cops,
nods her head again, and then walks off.

As he watches her walk away from the cops...

FLASH ON:


JACKIE AND MAX ON PHONE

JACKIE
You said it yourself. Ray wants
Ordell, he don't give a shit about
the money. Money won't convict him,
guns will. Yeah, sure, if it falls in
their lap, they take it. If they know
they got it, they'll look for it...
but if they don't...


BACK TO MAX AT MALL

Max watches the two cops turn their attention to the
young girl eating in the food court.

Max watches her, too. The Young Girl continues to work
her way through her Mexican food, when she turns her head
to an OLDER BLACK WOMAN sitting at the next table. The
older woman says something, and the younger woman hands
her the ashtray Jackie was using.

Max watches the Young Girl finish her food and get up
from the table. She stoops down to get the Broadway
shopping bag and walks out of the food court.

Max watches Nicolet and Dargus let the Young Girl get a
little ahead, then follow after her. They're gone.

Max turns back on the older woman all alone.

She finishes the coffee she was drinking and stands up,
carrying - how about that? - A Broadway shopping bag. The
woman heads out of the mall.

Max follows her.

The older woman walks past us. She heads straight for the
exit.


EXT. DEL AMO MALL - PARKING LOT - DAY

Max follows the woman outside.

She walks down a line of cars, then gets in a big, tan
Mercury sedan. She drives of...

... but not before Max writes down her license plate
number.

FLASH ON:


MAX AND JACKIE ON PHONE

MAX
You're rationalizing.

JACKIE
That's what you do to go through with
the shit you start. You rationalize.
I can do this, Max, I know I can. But
I can't do it without you.


INT. MAX'S CADILLAC - DAY

Max climbs into his Seville, starts her up, and drives
out of the parking lot.


CLOSEUP MAX

Driving down the street, lost in thought.

MAX
(to himself)
It could work... If she handles the
cops right, I could work...

He hits 'play' on the dash CD player. The Delfonics fill

A garage door is lifted open, revealing Ordell and Louis.


EXT. STORAGE FACLITY - DAY

Ordell and Louis are at Mr. Robbie's storage facility. A
VAN is backed up nect to the opening. The facility is
pitch black. Ordell ahs a big flashlight in his hand.

ORDELL
Check this out.

He turns on the flashlight.

He shines the beam into darkness. We see the facility is
filled to the gills with machine guns, shotguns, uzis, a
rocket launcher, and handguns of many types.

LOUIS
How much is there?

ORDELL
Over half-million dollars worth of
merchandise.

Ordell opens the back doors of the van. They start
unloading machine guns and boxes of ammo.

LOUIS
Can I ask you about Melanie?

ORDELL
Sure.

LOUIS
What's your relationship?

ORDELL
She one of the women I got set up. I
got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent
Simone a small house in Compton, and
about four blocks away I got me this
nineteen-year-old country girl named
Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a
bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot,
country as a chicken coop. Took her
to my house in Compton, told her it
was Hollywood.

LOUIS
She believed you?

ORDELL
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass,
Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's
ever been, anyway.

They both laugh together.

LOUIS
Do you trust Melanie?

Ordell stops unloading.

ORDELL
If this is about you fucked Melanie,
I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool.
I leave you alone with a bitch like
Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that
twenty minutes after I'm out the
door. So say "thank you" and I'll
tell you, "you're welcome."

LOUIS
That's not what I meant when I asked
did you trust her.

Ordell looks at him.

ORDELL
She tryin' to work your ass against
me, ain't she?

LOUIS
Yep.

ORDELL
You didn't even hafta say it. I know
the woman.

LOUIS
Well, why the fuck keep her around?

ORDELL
(smiling)
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal.
She can't do me no harm. Fact she
think she can play you against me
shows how little she knows. You could
teach that bitch for days how it is
'tween me an you, she never
understand a damn word.

LOUIS
Why do you let someone know your
business you can't trust?

ORDELL
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.

LOUIS
What does that mean?

ORDELL
You can't trust Melanie. But you can
always trust Melanie to be Melanie.

Louis starts unloading.

LOUIS
I still don't understand why you keep
her around.

ORDELL
I told you, man.
(smiling)
She my fine little surfer gal.


EXT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

EXTREME CLOSEUP - Jackie's finger presses a small black
button next to the
handwritten name, "M. RALSTON."


EXTREME CLOSEUP SPEAKER BOX

MELANIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
(coming out of it)
What?


JACKIE

Bends down to talk in the speaker.

JACKIE
It's Jackie.


INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - DAY

Jackie walks down the hallway and finds the door.

She rings the doorbell.

The door opens, she sees Melanie (for the first time) on
the other side. Melanie, dressed in a t-shirt, cut offs,
doesn't say a word - just turns around and walks away.

Once Melanie leaves, she sees Ordell standing inside the
apartment, screwdriver in hand, yelling after Melanie;

ORDEL
... Now she's gonna pout...

He turns his attention to Jackie.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Hey, Jackie, c'mon in.

Jackie steps inside.

She sees Louis (for the first time) sitting on the couch.

Ordell says to Louis, but loud enough for Melanie in the
other room to hear;

ORDELL (CONT'D)
She gonna hafta find her sandals...
find her bag... find her
sunglasses... take twenty damn
minutes get her ass out the door.
(to Jackie)
Jackie - his is Louis, Louis -
Jackie. And the chick stompin' around
in the other room is Melanie.

Melanie comes out of the bedroom with her sunglasses,
sandals, bag strung across her shoulders and her keys in
her hand. She makes a bee-line towards the door without
saying nothin' to nobody.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
You have a nice time, hear?

The door SLAMS behind her.

Ordell looks to Jackie, raises his screwdriver and says;

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Drink?

JACKIE
I need to talk to you alone.


EXT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - BALCONY - DAY

Ordell and Jackie on the balcony.

JACKIE
I don't want no more fuckin'
surprises. We do this the way I laid
it out, or we don't do it at all.

ORDELL
What the hell you talkin' bout?

JACKIE
Sheronda passin' the money onto
someone else, that's what the hell
I'm talkin' 'bout.

ORDELL
How do you know she did that?

JACKIE
I was there, I saw her do it.

ORDELL
Well, you weren't supposed to be
there.

JACKIE
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I
figured you'd try an' pull some shit
like this.

ORDELL
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin'
no shit. It's my money, I can do
whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.

JACKIE
Not when it's my ass on the line you
don't. We do this my way or fuck it.

Ordell tries to stop the hostile back and forth.

ORDELL
Just chill the fuck out, Jackie. It
ain't no big thing. The woman you saw
was my friend, Simone. She's the one
gonna be receiving the money, so I
just wanted her to see how it works.
She'll be here any minute. Nice
woman, you'll like her.

Ordell opens the sliding glass and says to Louis in the
living room;

ORDELL
Louis, call Simone and tell her to
get her tail over here. We're waitin'
on her ass.

Louis gets up to make the call.

Ordell turns back to Jackie and smiles, holding up his
screwdriver.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
I'm about ready for a refill. Sure I
can't tempt you?


INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Ordell and Jackie sit on stools around the kitchen
counter bar. Louis sits with them on the phone, silent.

JACKIE
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the
airport and mark the bills.

ORDELL
Man, I don't like that part.

JACKIE
It washes off. I tell them we're
doing it the same way as before.
They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the
idea of leaving her for a fall.

ORDELL
She won't have no problems 'cause she
don't know nothin'.

JACKIE
Are you sure she don' know about the
money?

ORDELL
She don't know shit about the money.

JACKIE
What does she think she's gettin?

ORDELL
I told her this is a game us rich
folks play, exchanging gifts. Like a
scavenger hunt. She didn't know what
that was neither.
(to Louis)
No answer?

Louis shakes his head.

LOUIS
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
Hang it up, she's on her way. You
gotta listen to this. This involves
you.

Louis hangs up the phone and joins the debriefing.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
No, you gonna give her a
Robinson's May bag this time?

JACKIE
Right, the one Simone gives me.
Simone and I'll make the switch at
Robinson's May. She knows what I look
like?

ORDELL
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone
goes to the dress department with her
Robinson's May bag.

JACKIE
Designer clothes.

ORDELL
She waits for you to go in the place
where you try things on.

JACKIE
The fitting room. There's a sign over
the door.

LOUIS
Why we doin' I there?

JACKIE
I have a hunch they'll be watchin'
me. We can't risk switching bags out
in the open or even in the dining
area. That's why it has to be a
woman, 'cause we do the switch in the
fitting room.

ORDELL
So you come out with her
Robinson's May bag, go meet Sheronda.
Simone peeks out, waits for my man
Louis here to give her a signal
nobody's watchin'. She leaves the
store, gets in her car - mission
accomplished.

JACKIE
Where you gonna be during all this?

ORDELL
I'm gonna be sittin' at the titty bar
In downtown L.A. till my man over
here calls me and gives me the O.K.
sign.

Jackie's pager goes off. She looks at it.

JACKIE
I gotta go.


INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

Ordell walks Jackie to the elevator.

ORDELL
Who's paging you?

JACKIE
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.

ORDELL
That works on my nerves, you bein' so
buddy-buddy with him.

JACKIE
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now
once I deliver I'll have to trust
you.

ORDELL
Well, I've been trusting you all this
time, haven't I? We agreed on ten
percent of what you bring in and
that's what you gonna get.

They reach the elevator. She presses the button.

JACKIE
And a hundred thousand if I go to
jail.

ORDELL
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't
gonna screw you. You haven't told me
where I put it for you.

The elevator arrives. Jackie steps in.

JACKIE
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max
Cherry. He'll take care of it.

ORDELL
Max Cherry? You and him friends now?
You tell him about this shit?

JACKIE
He won't know where the money came
from. Only that it's money.

... the elevator shuts... As it shuts Ordell yells;...

ORDELL
Don't you know all them bail bondsmen
are crooks...

... the door shuts.


CLOSEUP ORDELL

He doesn't like the last piece of new information.


EXT. THE STRAND - DAY

The Strand is the hip surfer street in downtown Hermosa
Beach. Jackie leaves the apartment building. She walks to
her car when she spots a funky little beach bar called,
"Sally Leroy's."


INT. SALLY LEROY'S - DAY

Sally Leroy's is a beach bar with surfboards, different
beer signs, and pictures of Marilyn Monroe, Elvis
Presley, James Dean, Ann Margaret, and surfers riding
monster waves all over the place.

The JUKEBOX plays a loud seventies rock number.


BEGINNING OF SHOT

The camera picks Jackie up through the window, walking
into the place and going up to the bar...

A female bartender in her mid-twenties, wearing a plaid
workshirt, named WANDA, goes to Jackie.

JACKIE
Do you have a phone?

WANDA
Yeah, it's in the back.

JACKIE
Thanks.

... We follow with her to the back of the bar... the
MUSIC is LOUD... the phone booth is occupied by a fat
older GUY wearing surf clothes and sporting a mustache
like a walrus. Jackie waits for him to finish his call...
As she waits, the CAMERA MOVES BACK... until a blonde
head of hair comes into the f.g....

The CAMERA MOVES around to a CLOSEUP ON MELANIE, sucking
on a beer, moving her head to the music, and watching
Jackie. She smiles and steps OUT OF FRAME.

END OF SHOT

Jackie hears behind her;

MELANIE (O.S.)
Hey!

Jackie turns and sees Melanie holding a beer, standing
behind her.

JACKIE
Oh, hi.

MELANIE
Buy ya a beer?

JACKIE
I'm waiting for the phone.

MELANIE
Good luck. That guy's been in there
since I got here.

JACKIE
Well, I guess I better look for
another one, then. Thanks, anyway.

Jackie turns to leave.

MELANIE
I know what you and Ordell got goin'.
You sit down and have a beer with me.
I'll tell you a secret.

Jackie looks at her a moment.

JACKIE
Sure.

MELANIE
Great...
(calling to the
bartender)
... Wanda!

Wanda approaches.

WANDA
What?

MELANIE
This lady is thirsty.

WANDA
What do you want?

MELANIE
What's on tap?

WANDA
Coors, Sam, Rolling Rock, and
Killian's Red.

JACKIE
Killian's.

MELANIE
Better get me another Sam's.
(to Jackie)
Join me in a Jaeger shot?


JACKIE
Uh-uh.

MELANIE
Gimme one anyway.

WANDA
You got it.

Wanda goes away. Jackie and Melanie sit at the bar. The
MUSIC is LOUD, and they have to talk over it. Melanie
moves her head to it during the conversation.

JACKIE
How long you been with Ordell?

MELANIE
This time? Almost a year. I've known
him forever.

JACKIE
What were you two fighting about?

MELANIE
He told me to go outside.
(imitating Ordell's
voice)
"You may leave us now." It's all part
of his pathetic attempt to be "the
man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?

Jackie nods "yes."

MELANIE (CONT'D)
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about
Ordell.

JACKIE
That coke was yours, wasn't it?

Melanie makes a face to show pain.

MELANIE
Oh, man, listen. I'm sorry about
that. I hope they don't come down on
you on my account. Ordell shoulda
told you it was in your bag.

Wanda brings the drinks.

WANDA
Seven dollars.

Melanie digs in her purse for the money.

JACKIE
He said he didn't know about it.

MELANIE
(digging in her purse)
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess
you have to trust him.
(pulls out a ten)
I'd have second thoughts on that, but
then I know 'em.

Melanie takes her Jaeger shot, lets it go down, then
continues.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
He killed a guy who works for him the
other day.

JACKIE
Beaumont Livingston?

MELANIE
You already knew that?

JACKIE
Kinda.

MELANIE
So tell me. Having all that money in
your flight bag - Is it tempting?

Jackie nods 'yes', as she sips her beer.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
I tell you. If Ordell ever sent me to
carry in ten thousand dollars, that
would be the last motherfuckin' time
he saw me. The next trip you're gonna
have over half-a-million. If you
thought of cutting Ordell out, I sure
as hell wouldn't blame you.

Jackie smiles.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
You think I'm kidding?

JACKIE
Dreaming.

MELANIE
You know how easy it would be? He
won't be anywhere near that mall.
Pull one more switch, up front.
That's it. half-a-million dollars.
Need help?

JACKIE
(smiling)
Keep it between us girls?

MELANIE
What's that fucker ever done for us?

JACKIE
(getting off the
barstool)
I don't think so, but thanks for the
beer.

Jackie leaves.


CLOSEUP MELANIE

Watches her go.

MELANIE
(softly under her breath)
Chicken shit.


INT. STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT

Jackie and Nicolet sit at a steakhouse eating a steak
dinner. Nicolet drinks beer, Jackie drinks white wine.

JACKIE
Ordell has a white guy working for
him named Louis.

NICOLET
You two meet?

JACKIE
This afternoon before I came here. He
was with Ordell at an apartment in
Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he
lives there, but I can find out.

NICOLET
You talk to him?

JACKIE
Not really.

NICOLET
His full name is Louis Gara. He just
got out from serving four years in
Susanville.

JACKIE
What for?

NICOLET
Bank robbery? Do you know what he
does for Ordell?

JACKIE
I imagine shit needs to be done.

NICOLET
We've been following Mr. Gara, and
he's definitely working for Ordell.

FLASH ON:


NICOLET AND DARGUS

In a car, parked, on surveillance.


COPS POV

Louis with the van, at the storage facility.

NICOLET (V.O.)
They served two years together almost
twenty years ago in Soledad. But he
doesn't live in Hermosa Beach.
Ordell's got him staying at a house
in.


MUG SHOT SIMONE

The older woman in the mall.

NICOLET (V.O.)
... Compton with a fifty-six-year-
old petty thief - woman named Simone
Hawkins.


BACK TO BAR

NICOLET
Ever meet her, or they talk about
her?

JACKIE
Not yet.

NICOLET
Who's the other one?

JACKIE
White girl named Melanie Ralston.
Another girlfriend of Ordell's.

NICOLET
What's her story?

JACKIE
It was her coke I got busted with.
She knows everything, but she's not
part of it, and she's pissed cause
she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't
even let her stay at the meeting. She
tried to talk me into ripping off
Ordell.

NICOLET
And splittin' with her?

JACKIE
I'm sure that was the idea.

NICOLET
What did you say?

JACKIE
I smiled and walked away. She also
told me Ordell killed Beaumont.

NICOLET
She told you that?

JACKIE
Uh-huh.

NICOLET
Was she there?

JACKIE
She didn't say.

NICOLET
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?

JACKIE
Uh-huh.

NICOLET
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd
like to have a word with. So
everything's set for tomorrow?

JACKIE
Right. Everything's the same, except
one change...


INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Max sits on the couch in Jackie's apartment drinking
white wine.

Jackie paces in front of him, white wine in one hand,
Davidoff in the other, going over the details of
tomorrow. One could notice a slight change in Jackie.

There's a bit of an edge to Miss Brown that's bubbling
underneath her cool surface. It's understandable. After
all, she's been the architect of this half-a-million
dollars switcheroo. She's moved heaven and earth to make
all the pieces fall into place, and all the players thnk
what she wants them to think.

As she talks to Max she knows tomorrow all her hard work
will either fail or succeed. But don't take this
difference the wrong way. This edge I'm referring to is
not one born out of fear (Jackie's nervous, but she's not
afraid). It's more the edge an athlete might feel before
an all-important competition.

JACKIE
I told them Ordell's changed the
amount he's bringing in.

MAX
Do you think they bought it?

JACKIE
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking
Ordell's real nervous. They love
thinking he's scared of them.

MAX
You know, a good cop won't let you
know he knows you're fulla shit.

JACKIE
All he needed was a reasonable
explanation.

DISSOLVE TO:


BACK TO JACKIE WITH NICOLET

MEDIUM JACKIE

JACKIE
Right. Everything's the same except
one change. Ordell thinks it's just
too hot right now to bring in all his
money. He knows you're watching him,
and he's paranoid. He's keeping his
stash where it is, but he wants to
bring in fifty thousand for bail in
case he needs it.

CUT TO:


BACK TO JACKIE AND MAX

MAX
It'll be more than that.

JACKIE
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.

MAX
But you still have to show him the
money at the airport.

JACKIE
Well, you know I'm not going to show
him the whole amount. He'll see fifty
thousand.

MAX
Where's the rest of it?

JACKIE
In the bag underneath.

MAX
What if he checks it?

JACKIE
He won't - I mean, he didn't the last
time. He'll be expecting fifty
thousand and there it is - on top.

MAX
You're takin' a helluva chance kid.

JACKIE
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr.
Walker put the money in, and I didn't
know nothing about it. Like the coke.

MAX
Then you're out and you get nothing.

JACKIE
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I
tried.

MAX
You're gonna have surveillance all
over you.

JACKIE
That's why you don't make a move till
I come out of the fitting room.

MAX
In a dress.

JACKIE
Well, a suit. There's one I had my
eye on.

The phone rings.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Excuse me.


INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

EXTREME CLOSEUP - Ordell on the phone

ORDELL
It's Ordell. We got a bit of a change
in plans here. Nothing to worry 'bout
- everything's the same - except for
one change. That bitch you saw in the
mall, Simone. She wasn't here today,
cause she split on me.
(pause)
Me an Louis went over to her place
,she's gone. She's gone and all her
shit's gone and so's my ten thousand
dollars.
(pause)
It ain't nothin' to worry about,
girl. Everything's just like we
discussed. Except when you do the
switch, instead of Simone, it's gonna
be Melanie.

Melanie is lying on the couch, sprawled out like a cat.
Louis sits at the other end of the couch. They're
watching "Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry" on TV.


ON TV

Peter Fonda and Susan George make jokes as they're
pursued by police cars.

They can hear Ordell on the phone. Melanie smiling at
Louis, flirtatiously and conspiratorially lifts her bare
foot and rubs his arm with it. Louis turns to her and
gives her a look that says: "I'm not on your side, bitch.
So knock it of."

Melanie sees this and takes her foot away.

Louis turns back to the television.


CLOSEUP MELANIE

Looks at Louis for a moment, then sighs, saying under her
breath;

MELANIE
Chicken shit.

it. The CAMERA moves into a CLOSEUP of the little black
airplane.

Looking down...


INT. AIRPLANE BATHROOM - DAY

Rearranging her bag. The five hundred thousand inside
takes up half the space. She tucks lingerie around the
edges, covers the money with blouses, shoes, and skirts
and ties I all down tight. Then places a fat envelope
with fifty thousand right on top.


INT. CABIN - AIRPLANE - DAY

Jackie steps out of the bathroom, walks down the aisle,
and is stopped by a PASSENGER.

PASSENGER
Listen, Miss, I'm waiting for a drink
and you spend half the fuckin' flight
in the can. Soon as we land I'm
making a formal complaint.

JACKIE
Why, because I called you an asshole.

PASSENGER
You didn't call me that.

JACKIE
I didn't? Oh, well, you're an
asshole.


INT. LAX PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY

SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:

"TIME: 3:00"

Jackie steps into the LAX parking structure, pulling her
bag on wheels behind her.

Waiting for her is Ray Nicolet.

NICOLET
We have to stop meeting like this.

They fall into step towards her car.

JACKIE
You said that the last time.

NICOLET
Well, it's true, isn't it? After his
is buttoned up we could meet
someplace else. What do you think?

JACKIE
We could, if I'm not in jail.

NICOLET
Oh, that's taken care of. I called
the State Attorney's Office. You were
no-filed this morning in Circuit
Court.


CLOSEUP JACKIE

This information stops Jackie in her tracks.

JACKIE
Are you saying I'm off the hook?


JACKIE'S POV

Nicolet, who kept walking when Jackie stopped, looks back
at Jackie.

NICOLET
Free as a bird. I still expect you to
finish the job, though. How much do
you have this time?

Jackie starts walking again

JACKIE
Fifty thousand, like I said. He's
pretty sure he's gonna need it for
bail.


INT. JACKIE'S HONDA - DAY

Jackie and Nicolet in the parked car. Ray has the flight
bag in his lap.

He unzips it.

He sees the clothes with the envelope on top.

Jackie watches all of this.

NICOLET
That's fifty thousand, huh? It
doesn't look like that much.

JACKIE
I was told ten thousand in each pack.

NICOLET
You didn't count it?

JACKIE
I never have. It's not my money.

He puts the envelope back in the bag and feels through
the folds of a skirt.

NICOLET
He might have slipped some coke in
here. Did you check?

Jackie, cool.

JACKIE
Mr. Walker promised he'd never do
that again.

Nicolet's fingers move to a pair of black heels wedged
into the side... they touch the shoes... then move over
to the envelope, opens the clasp and takes out five
rubber-banded bond packets of loot.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Ever been tempted?

NICOLET
What? To put one of these in my
pocket?

JACKIE
Uh-huh.

NICOLET
If I did, I'd have to give you one,
wouldn't I? Or we could take what we
want. No one knows how much there is
except us, right?

JACKIE
Yes. All those things are true.

NICOLET
After all, it don't belong to nobody,
right?

JACKIE
That would be one point of view.

NICOLET
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view
that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it
evidence, it belongs to us. You are
now officially out of trouble. Don't
do nothing stupid, now.

JACKIE
How can I do anything if I'm being
watched every second?

NICOLET
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me
the trouble of pointing it out to
you.
(holding up the money)
Put this in your shopping bag. It's
what I expect to find when I look in
Sheronda's. Comprende?

JACKIE
Si.

INT. MELANIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Louis stands in the empty living room, talking to Ordell
on the phone. Kate Bush plays in the b.g.

LOUIS
I was ready to leave ten minutes ago.

Ordell snaps at Louis, not so harsh Louis is forced to
retaliate, but enough to express his loss of patience.

ORDELL
Well, you the one in motherfuckin'
charge.

LOUIS
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'

ORDELL
Go in there, snatch her by the hair,
and drag her big ass out. This is my
goddam money we're talking about. Get
your ass out the door.

He hangs up on Louis.

Louis, pissed at being hung up on and talked to like
that, hangs up the phone and turns his frustration where
it rightly belongs - Melanie.

Louis stomps towards the bedroom where the music's
playing.

LOUIS
We're leaving now!

MELANIE (O.S.)
All right already.


MONTAGE

We see a montage of the individual characters in route to

In his Cadillac Seville, cruising down Hawthorne
Boulevard to the mall. He plays hid Delfonics CD.


LOUIS AND MELANIE

In Melanie's Toyota drive towards the mall. Melanie
drives singing along with Kate Bush on her car stereo.


EXT. DEL AMO MALL PARKING LOT - DAY

Jackie's car pulls up to a lined parking space in the
parking lot.

SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:

"TIME 3:52"

Jackie gets out of the Honda with her flight bag. She
goes to her hatchback, takes a Robinson's May bag, lines
the first half of the bag with old paperbacks.

Then takes out of the flight bag the envelope with the
fifty-thousand marked dollars, takes one packet of ten
thousand, and puts it in her pocket. She lines the
envelope with forty thousand across the books, then fills
the rest of the bag with beach towels.

Then with her flight bag slung over her shoulder,
carrying the Robinson's May bag and with all the
confidence of a world champion prize fighter going into
the ring, she strides toward the hugs mall.


INT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY

Jackie enters the mall. She looks at the people buzzing
around. Any one of them could be surveillance.

She calmly walks down the mall, then turns into the
Roinson's May store.


INT. ROBINSON'S MAY - DESIGNER CLOTHES - DAY

Jackie, in her Cabo Air uniform, walks up to a young
Asian saleswoman named Amy in the Robinson's May designer
clothing area.

The saleswoman smiles when she sees Jackie.

AMY
Can I help you?

JACKIE
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye
on.

Jackie steps out of the fitting room wearing a real
sharp, badass, black suit with a white blouse.

AMY
Oh, my God. You look so cool.

Jackie moves over to the mirror, and checks herself out.

JACKIE
This looks pretty good on me.

AMY
Are you kidding, it looks great. You
wear this to a business meeting,
you're the badass in the room. But
you can go out dancing in this too.
It's a total power suit.

Jackie studies her reflection.

JACKIE
I think I'm gonna just get this for
today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would
you mind ringing this up while I
change out of it?

AMY
Not a problem.

JACKIE
Thanks.

Jackie walks into the fitting room.


INT. FITTING ROOM - DAY

She walks down the fitting room hallway with changing
cubicles on her right, enters the last one.

She closes the door and sits down on the bench in between
her flight bag full of money and the Robinson's May bag.

A full-length mirror is straight I front of her. She
looks at herself... when someone comes into the stall
next to her.

Melanie's voice comes from the other side of the wall.

MEALNIE (O.S.)
Jackie?

JACKIE
Hi, Melanie.

MELANIE (O.S.)
Are you getting that black suit?

JACKIE
Yeah, do you like it?

MELANIE (O.S.)
It looks good on you.

JACKIE
Do you got something for me?

MELANIE (O.S.)
You betcha.

A Robinson's May bag, like Jackie's, filled with towels,
comes sliding underneath the stall.

Jackie picks up her Robinson's May bag, filled with
books, towels and the marked forty-thousand dollars.

She takes the loose packet of ten-thousand marked dollars
and lies it on top of the bag.

As she does all this Melanie continues talking.

MELANIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
We coulda worked this. You know that,
dontcha? You would've made out a lot
better than you're going to, believe
me.

Jackie slides the Robinson's May bag with money under the
stall.

Melanie sees the money on top and stops talking.

JACKIE
I put a little cherry on top. You're
right. What the hell he ever do for
us?

MELANIE (O.S.)
(quietly)
Thanks.

JACKIE
Now be careful with that bag. You
don't want it ripping open on you in
the middle of the store.

We hear the SOUND of Melanie leaving.

Jackie then transfers the half of a million dollars out
of her flight bag into Melanie's Robinson's May bag. She
sticks her uniform in the flight bag.

Then takes the towels and puts them on top of the money.
She grabs her flight bag and leaves, leaving behind the
Robinson's May bag filled with half of a million dollars.


INT. DESIGNER CLOTHES - DAY

Jackie, looking sharp in her new suit but acting a touch
frantic and anxious, walks rapidly toward the sales
counter where Amy waits for her.

JACKIE
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in
the suit - get out of that damn
uniform.

AMY
Oh, that's not a problem.

As Jackie and the salesgirl complete their transaction
the CAMERA CIRCLES them, SLOWLY at first, but more
RAPIDLY each go-around. They complete the transaction and
as Jackie starts to leave, she stops and says to Amy;

JACKIE
Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
there. Looks like beach towels.

She leaves. We follow her...


INT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY

... Jackie walks out of Robinson's May hurriedly into the
main mall. The calm, cool stride we're used to with
Jackie is completely gone.

She stops, looks around, head darting from one direction
to another. She looks in a panic. The CAMERA begins to
twirl around her. She seems to be looking for something
she doesn't see. She looks helpless and on the verge of
tears.

As the twirling CAMERA circles her, she screams;

JACKIE
Ray! Ray! I need you! Come out! She
took the money.

The CAMERA stops twirling.

Nicolet, Dargus, and two other plainclothes cops, come
running out of a store towards Jackie. As they reach her,
a frantic Jackie yells;

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Melanie burst in the dressing room
and took the money!

CUT TO:


EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY

Louis and Melanie pull up to a lined parking space in
Melanie's Toyota.

SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:

"TIME: 4:12"

Louis is the first out of the car.

LOUIS
Come on, goddammit, we're late!


INT. DEL AMO MALL - DAY

We STEDICAM in front of them, Louis the rapid pacesetter,
pulling Melanie behind him by the hand. Melanie carries
the Robinson's May switch bag.

MELANIE
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.

LOUIS
We shoulda been there already and we
woulda been if it hadn't been for
your fuckin' around!

They go inside Robinson's May...


INT. ROBINSON'S MAY - DAY

... We STEDICAM into Robison's May with them. We lose
them for a moment behind racks of dresses and mannequins,
but end up landing on Jackie in her black suit, looking
in a mirror and talking to Amy on the Designer Clothes
floor.

AM
... You wear this to a business
meeting, you're the badass in the
room...

We PAN away and find Louis and Melanie by a dress rack,
watching Jackie.

MELANIE
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm
gonna go over and look at this Michi
Moon display.

LOUIS
Just stay right fuckin' here, all
right?

MELANIE
Are you sweating?

Louis' hand immediately goes to his forehead and touches
dampness.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
Job a little too much for you?

Louis shoots Melanie a hard convict look.

Melanie smiles at him, feeling the stare, but too much of
a natural-born smart ass to change.

MELANIE
I'll be over here. You're too
conspicuous.

Louis looks over at the fitting room. Jackie is going
inside it, and the saleswoman is walking away towards
him.

He watches the saleswoman walk by him, then looks back in
time to see Melanie enter the fitting room.

LOUIS
(under his breath)
Goddammit, not till I tell ya.

He decides he's watching the fitting room entrance too
much, so he starts throwing his look around when he sees
something that stops him cold.


MAX CHERRY

Max is looking at dresses, paying no attention to the
fitting room.

He thinks, 'what the fuck is Max Cherry doing here?'

Max, doing what he's doing, looks up and sees Louis
staring at him across the floor. Max smiles and gives
Louis a wave before turning his back to him and continues
to do what he was doing.

He quickly looks around the store to see anything else;
any more surprise guests, possible police surveillance.
Everything looks normal. The saleswoman is behind the
register ringing up Jackie's purchase. The few customers
there are doing customer stuff.

Then he sees Melanie come out with a Robinson's May bag
and head down a different aisle.

He hurries down his aisle and cuts her off. Their whole
fight is said tense and low.

LOUIS
What are you doin'?

MELANIE
I'm getting out of here. What do you
think?

LOUIS
Lemme have the bag.

MELANIE
Fuck you. I can carry it.

She tries to push past him, and he catches her by her arm
and pulls her around.

LOUIS
Goddam you. Gimme that bag,

MELANIE
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the
fuckin' bag?

LOUIS
Gimme that bag before I knock you out
and take it.

Melanie realizes Louis ain't fuckin' kiddin'. Not only
that, this old guy looks close to buggin'. She lets go of
the bag.

MELANIE
Okay, okay. Take it. Jesus, what's
wrong with you?

He takes it. They start walking. We STEDICAM in front of
them.

LOUIS
I'm carrying it.

MELANIE
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill
pill, for christ sake.

Louis has had enough of her slang and says tensely
through gritted teeth;

LOUIS
Fuck you with your chill pill.

In mid-walk, Melanie asks him;

MELANIE
Remember where we came in?

Louis stops dead. He looks around, confused.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
(like a teacher on Romper
Room)
Nooo, that's towards Sears. We came
in through Bullocks. I know where it
is. Want to follow me, Lou-is?

Pissed, he leaves FRAME. Melanie, wearing her Melanie
smirk, follows behind.


EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY

Louis, clutching the shopping bag close to his chest,
walks rapidly down an aisle of parked cars.

Melanie follows close behind.

We STEDICAM alongside. We walk for awhile, Louis changes
direction to another aisle. WE'RE NOW IN FRONT of him. We
see he has a searching look on his face.

MELANIE
You have no idea where you parked, do
you?

Louis doesn't answer.

Melanie laughs.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
Jesus, but if you two aren't the
biggest fuck-ups I've ever seen in my
life... How did you ever rob a bank?
When you robbed banks, did you have
to look for your car then too? No
wonder you went to jail.

Louis could kill her right now. Just take his gun out of
his pants and shoot her in her snickering face. But
instead of doing what he wants, he does what he should.
He doesn't answer of look back. (If he looked back and
saw that Melanie-smirk, he couldn't e responsible for
what happens.)He changes directions, cuts down another
aisle and hopes for both their sakes she shuts the fuck
up.

But our Melanie just keeps on being Melanie.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?

LOUIS
Yeah, down the end.

MELANIE
You sure?

They walk it; it's not it.

Louis changes direction and cuts between some cars to the
next one.

MELANIE (CONT'D)
Is it this aisle or the next one
over?

LOUIS
This one.

MELANIE
You sure?

In between two cars, Louis spins on her.

LOUIS
Don't say anything else, okay? I'm
telling you, keep your mouth shut.

Melanie was surprised by the spin, but is about to say
something anyway when Louis put his hand up and says;

LOUIS
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin'
word.

MELANIE
Okay, Lou-is.

That did it!

Louis whips out the Beretta Ordell gave him, shoots
her... BAM... in the belly.

She bounces OFF one of the cars and goes down.

BAM... Louis shoots her again on the ground.

One; to make sure. Two; cause it felt good.

Then he hurries of for his car. WE FOLLOW IN FRONT OF
HIM. He looks around, then yells out;

LOUIS
See, just where I fuckin' said it
was!

He hops in the car, and throws it into reverse.

We can se Melanie's bare legs sticking out from a row of
cars. Louis stops the Toyota alongside the dead Melanie,
and yells through the passenger window;

LOUIS
Hey, look. I found it!

He drives away.

CUT TO:


EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY

Max Cherry's Cadillac Seville pulls up to a lined space
in the parking lot.

SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:

"TIME: 4:04"

Max gets out of his car and casually strolls towards the
Del Amo Mall.


INT. ROBINSON'S MAY - DAY

Max, hands in pocket, strolls unhurriedly through the
Robinson's May store.

He walks around the store, keeping one eye peeled toward
the Designer Clothes section. He walks up to a jewelry
counter and begins looking at he pieces in the display
case, when a pretty, young SALESGIRL comes up to him.

SALESGIRL
Can I show you something?

MAX
Not right now. I'm just killing time
waiting for my wife. But thanks,
anyway.

SALESGIRL
Sure thing. If anything grabs you,
don't be shy.

MAX
Thanks, I won't.

She goes off.

He looks towards Designer Clothes and sees Jackie walking
out of the fitting room wearing the cool black suit.

AMY
Oh, my God. You look so cool.

Jackie moves over to the mirror and checks herself out.

Max looks back to the jewelry display case, saying under
his breath;

MAX (CONT'D)
(low)
And away we go.

Jackie looks at her reflection in the mirror. Then she
lifts her eyes, meeting Max's across the room. Max gives
her a nod of his head to show he approves. Jackie smiles
and breaks contact, turning to Amy. We hear her say from
a distance. "This looks pretty good on me."

Max hears a commotion behind him and turns to see Louis
and Melanie hurriedly making their way towards Designer
Clothes.

He turns his attention back to browsing through dresses
on a rack.

He sees Louis and Melanie squabbling.

He sees Jackie disappear into the fitting room.

He sees Amy leaving the fitting room entrance.

He watches Melanie, by herself, watch Amy leave. Melanie
watches the fitting room for a few moments. Gathering her
courage, then makes her move, entering the fitting room.

Max smiles to himself, "so far so good" he thinks. He
throws a look towards Louis, only to see Louis staring
dead at him with an unhappy look on his face. Max returns
the look with a smile and a wave then turns his back on
his before he can see a reaction.

Max continues his fake browsing.

He sees Melanie come out of the fitting room carrying a
Robinson's May bag close to her chest.

She and Louis disappear.

He sees Jackie come out of the fitting room, go over to
Amy and buy the dress. Jackie goes into her act, acting
agitated and distracted as she talks to Amy, pays with
cash, then leaves stopping to say;

JACKIE
Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in
there. Looks like beach towels.

She's gone.

Amy is left alone by the cashier counter.

It's Max's turn.

As Max looks at Amy, then at the fitting room entrance,
he says to himself;

MAX
Max, old boy. You've spent nineteen
years dealing with people who take
incredible risks. You walk over to
that counter, you're gonna find out
what it's like.

Max takes a few moments...

... then walks over to Amy.

MAX
Excuse me, but my wife thinks she
left a bag of beach towels in the
fitting room?

AMY
Yeah, I think they're back there. Go
get 'em. There's nobody in there. I
think they're in the last stall.

MAX
Thanks.

Max walks toward the fitting room, enters it, walks down
the length of stalls, and stops in front of the last one.

He opens the door to the stall. Sitting in the corner is
the Robinson's May bag. He walks over to it, lifts out
the towels, and sees all that money. He replaces the
towels, picks up the bag and leaves. HE walks across the
Designer Clothes, passes by Amy, says;

MAX
Got 'em, thanks.

AMY
Sure thing.

Max walks unhurriedly toward the door that leads to the
parking lot.


EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY

He's outside; nobody's stopped him. He keeps walking
towards his blue Seville. He keeps walking unhurriedly,
never looking back. He gets to his car, uses opening the
car door as an excuse to look back at the mall.

It's normal. Nobody's after him, nobody's watching him.
He made it. It worked.

Max allows himself a smile, gets into his Cadillac with
his half-a-million bucks and drives away.


INT. SAM'S HOFFIN BRAUS - DAY

Ordell sits at the bar in Sam's drinking a screwdriver
and watching a stripper strip.

BARTENDER
There a Ordell here?

ORDELL
That's me.

The bartender hands him the phone.

BARTENDER
Don't talks all day.

Ordell takes the receiver.


INT. TOYOTA (MOVING) - DAY

A stressed Louis drives the Toyota, calling Ordell on
Ordell's tiny cellular.

LOUIS
It's Louis.

ORDELL
(now into phone)
Did you get it?

LOUIS
I got it. Listen, there's something
else I have to tell you.

ORDELL
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's.
You count the money?

LOUIS
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's
still in the shopping bag.

ORDELL
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.
(pause)
Louis.

LOUIS
That's what I got to talk to you
about. You see, Melanie was giving me
a hard time -

ORDELL
- Not now, pick me up.

Louis hears the phone disconnect.


EXT. SAM'S HOFFIN BRAUR - DAY

The Toyota pulls up to the back of the bar. Ordell hops
in, the car takes off.


INT. TOYOTA (MOVING) - DAY

Oredell in the passenger seat, bends over to the
backseat, grabs the shopping bag, and brings it to his
lap. He looks like a kid at Christmas.

ORDELL
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where
they got all them car dealerships.
We're gonna leave this heap in a
parking lot and get one the cops
don't know about.
(pause)
Hey, where's Melanie?

LOUIS
That's what I gotta tell you. She
bugged me the whole time. Got pissy
with me 'cause I wouldn't let her
carry the bag. Started running her
fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember
right away when we came out where the
car was parked, so she got on me
about that. "Is it this aisle Lou-is,
is it that one?" She was totally
fuckin' with my nerves.

ORDELL
So what, you left her there.

LOUIS
I shot her.

Ordell just looks at him.

LOUIS (CONT'D)
I expect she's dead.

Ordell still doesn't say anything... then says;

ORDELL
You shot Melanie?

LOUIS
Twice. In the parking lot.

ORDELL
Couldn't talk to her?

LOUIS
You know how she is.

ORDELL
You couldn't just hit her?

LOUIS
Maybe... but at that moment... I
dunno...

ORDELL
You shot her twice?

LOUIS
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
So you're sure she's dead.

LOUIS
Pretty sure.

ORDELL
Where did you shoot her?

LOUIS
In the chest and stomach.

ORDELL
Well, if you had to do it, you had to
do it. What we don't want is that
bitch surviving on us. Anybody but
that woman.

Ordell shrugs it off, and digs into the shopping bag. He
pulls out the towels and sees forty-thousand dollars on
top of a bunch of paperbacks. His stomach drops. He just
looks inside the bag for the longest time.

Louis drives, oblivious to Ordell's dilemma.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
(quiet)
Louis?

LOUIS
(not looking at him)
What?

ORDELL
Where's the rest of it?

LOUIS
(looking at him)
How much it there?

ORDELL
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.

LOUIS
You said five hundred and fifty!

ORDELL
(calm)
So you light, ain't you. You light
about a half-a-million.

LOUIS
Look, that's the bag she came out
with. She never even put her hand in
it, and neither did I.

ORDELL
Came outta where?

LOUIS
The fitting room. It went down
exactly the way it was supposed to.

ORDELL
How long was she in there?

LOUIS
Maybe a minute. She came right out.

ORDELL
Louis, You tellin' me the truth?

LOUIS
Look, I swear to fucking god, she
came out with that bag and I took it
from her.

ORDELL
Then what?

LOUIS
We went to the parking lot.

ORDELL
Where you shot her.

LOUIS
That's right.

ORDELL
You sure she ain't somewhere with a
half-a-million dollars I worked my
ass off to earn?

Louis looks at Ordell;

LOUIS
(quietly)
Fuck you for asking me that.

ORDELL
Pull the car over.

Louis pulls it over, and stops on Ninth.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
What'd you shoot her with?

LOUIS
It's in there.

Ordell opens the glove box and takes out the Beretta. He
smells the end of the barrel. He releases the magazine.

LOUIS (CONT'D)
What's that gonna tell you" If I was
really pullin' a burn, I'd have taken
two out, wouldn't I? I thought you
trusted me.

Ordell looks at him. Louis didn't burn him.


CLOSEUP ORDELL

He thinks.

DISSOLVE TO:


CLOSEUP JACKIE

Holding a bunch of money, looking into the camera, and
saying with a smile;

JACKIE
Gotcha, nigga.

DISSOLVE BACK
TO:


CLOSEUP ORDELL

Jackie's gonna die. He slaps the magazine back into the
Beretta.

ORDELL
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.

LOUIS
If she's got it, why didn't she take
it all?

ORDELL
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out,
I'll ask her.

LOUIS
Maybe the Feds got it.

ORDELL
If there were nothin; in here but
towels, maybe she didn't get a chance
to take it from her suitcase and
A.T.F. got it. But, she put these
fuckin' books in here to trick our
ass.

LOUIS
That's why I never checked it. The
bag felt right.

ORDELL
Then she throws forty thousand in
here, to rub the shit in my face,
know what I'm saying? She wants me to
know she ripped me off.

LOUIS
I don't know. Either she has it or
the Feds.

ORDELL
Or...
(pause)
... she gave it to somebody else
first, before Melanie went in the
dressing room.

It gets real quiet in the car, as Louis remembers
something.

LOUIS
Jesus Christ.

ORDELL
What?

LOUIS
You know who I saw in the dress
department?

ORDELL
Tell me.

LOUIS
I didn't really think anything of it.
No - I did wonder what he was doing
there, but didn't think it had
anything to do with us. You know like
maybe he was there with his wife or
girlfriend.

ORDELL
You gonna tell me who it was?

LOUIS
Max Cherry.

Ordell has to look away from Louis, takes a beat, then
looks back.

ORDELL
You see Max Cherry in the dress
department. We're about to be handed
half-a-million dollars - Man, look at
me when I'm talking to you! And you
don't think nothing of him being
there!

LOUIS
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know
each other?

ORDELL
Hell, yes, they know each other. He
bonded her out of county.

LOUIS
How am I supposed to know that?

ORDELL
You know the motherfucker's a bail
bondsman, don't ya? You know every
last one of them motherfuckers is
crooked as hell?

LOUIS
Why should I think anything's weird,
if I don't know nothin' about them
knowing each other?

ORDELL
Man, I don't want to hear your
fuckin' excuses!

Louis gets mad.

LOUIS
I ain't givin' you fuckin' excuses,
I'm givin' you reasons.

ORDELL
Oh, you gonna tell me the reason you
lost all the goddam money I got in
the world! Let me tell you the
reason, motherfucker! The reason is,
your ass ain't worth a shit no more!

Louis turns into the hard convict on the yard, and tells
Ordell;

LOUIS
(hard)
You best back off.

We hear a BAM.

Louis jerks.

Ordell shot him.

Louis falls back against the car door, eyes wide open,
staring at Ordell.

Ordell takes the pistol, works the barrel up higher on
Louis' side, right under him arm, and shoots him again.

This time Louis' head BANGS against the car door window.
He slumps over - his life gone.

Ordell looks at him.

ORDELL
What the fuck happened to you, man?
Shit, your ass use'ta be beautiful.

Ordell takes the bag and gets out of the car, leaving
Louis' dead body there.

DISSOLVE TO:


MEDIUM NICOLET

NICOLET
You didn't tell me you were gonna do
some shopping.


INT. NICOLET'S OFFICE (A.T.F. HEADQUARTERS) - DAY

Jackie, still dressed in her cool black suit, sits in a
chair in Nicolet's office. Davidoff between the fingers
of one hand, she holds a small, white styrofoam cup of
coffee in he other.

Ray stands.

JACKIE
I thought I did.

NICOLET
You didn't. I would think with all
this on your mind, you'd wait till
after.

JACKIE
I got there early. I've had my eye on
this suit - Wait, let's start over. I
got there early. The idea was to try
on the suit, see if I liked it. If I
did, get them to wrap it up, and
change back into my uniform. That's
what Sheronda's expecting me to wear.
Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag
with fifty thousand, and go home.

NICOLET
But you didn't do that.

JACKIE
Because I didn't have it. Ray, I
swear, Melanie came in and grabbed
it.
(pause)
And someone killed her for it.

Nicolet looks at Jackie for a moment.

NICOLET
Where's the bag she gave you?

JACKIE
She didn't give me one. I told you
before, Melanie wasn't part of the
plan. Ordell must of told her to do
it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping
bag, and takes off. What am I
supposed to do, go after her? I'm in
my fucking underwear. I had to get
dressed before I could do anything.
So I put this back on 'cause could
put this on faster than I could my
uniform.

NICOLET
You took the time to pay the
saleswoman.

JACKIE
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't
know what to do.

NICOLET
What did you do after that?

JACKIE
I went looking for you. I went
straight to the bookstore, 'cause
that's where you were last time, but
you weren't there. How the hell else
am I supposed to let anybody know
what happened? You didn't tell me how
to do that, did you? I knew I was
under surveillance, so when I
couldn't spot anybody, I started
yelling.

NICOLET
There was a guy with Melanie?

JACKIE
Not in the fitting room.

CUT TO:


A YOUNG WOMAN A.T.F SURVEILLANCE AGENT

Pretends to shop. She watches Louis grab Melanie.

NICOLET (V.O.)
We had our agent on you. She sees a
blonde come out of the fitting room
carrying a Robinson's May bag and
tussle with a tough-looking white
guy. The white guy takes the shopping
bag and they go.


BACK TO OFFICE

NICOLET
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis
Gara?

JACKIE
I didn't see him. I was in my
underwear. If it was a white guy, it
was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?

NICOLET
It's possible. You're saying you
don't have any idea what happened to
that fifty thousand?

JACKIE
I have no idea.

NICOLET
You'd take a polygraph on it?

JACKIE
If it'll make you happy.

NICOLET
I sure hope you haven't done anything
dumb Jackie.

Dargus comes to the doorway...

DARGUS
(to Nicolet)
Can I have a word with you?

NICOLET
Sure.

They both leave, leaving Jackie all by herself in the
room, smoking.

They both come back in.

Nicolet continues, Dargus takes a seat in the corner
saying nothing.

NICOLET (CONT'D)
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him
dead in a car on Ninth. And we've
lost Ordell.

JACKIE
I thought you were watching him.

NICOLET
We were, and we lost him. He walked
into a strip bar sometime around
three thirty and never came out. The
bar was on Ninth, less than a mile-
and-a-half from where Louis was found
dead. It looks like Louis's friend
shot him twice at point blank range.

JACKIE
So what happens now?

NICOLET
We pick up Ordell. We've got three
murders we can link him to. We have
the storage unit where he keeps his
guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search
warrant to go in and get him. And we
have you.

JACKIE
What about me?

NICOLET
What about you?

JACKIE
Do you think I took some of that
money?

NICOLET
I have no evidence of your taking
anything. You didn't pay for your
snazzy new suit with marked bills; I
was glad to see that. You've been
helping us out, you gave us Melanie
and Louis. Melanie had a packet of
marked bills stuffed in her shorts
when they found her, which goes a
long way backing up your story.

Jackie listens.

NICOLET (CONT'D)
I'll settle for Ordell with the
marked bills.

NICOLET
If you have something else going on
you haven't told me about, it's
between you and Ordell. All I gotta
say is, you better hope we find him
before he finds you.

DISSOLVE TO:


CLOSEUP ORDELL

On the phone.

ORDEL
... I can't leave here today... Mr.
Walker, I ain't goin' nowhere till I
get my money... You wouldn't have
that fuckin' boat weren't for me.
Man, I'm learnin' real fast who my
friends are... Mr. Walker?


INT. FILTHY APARTMENT - DAY

Ordell turn to a glassy-eyed black female junkie nodding
on the couch named RAYNELLE. The filthy apartment we're
in belongs to her.

ORDELL
Can you believe that shit?
Motherfucker hung up on me. Ingrate
nigger. Do things for people and
that's how they treat you. Goddamn
girl, how can you live like this?

He dials another number.

RAYNELLE
(stoned)
Like what?

ORDELL
Girl, this shit is repugnant.

WINSTON (O.S.)
(on other end of phone)
Cherry Bail Bonds.

ORDELL
Let me speak to Max Cherry.


INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY

Winston behind his desk, on the phone.

WINSTON
He ain't here right now.

ORDELL
He leave town?

WINSTON
He's around.

ORDELL
Give me his home number.

WINSTON
I'll give you his beeper.

CUT TO:


A YOUNG BLACK COMEDIAN ON TV

Def Comedy Jam plays on TV, a black comedian does a nasty
stand-up routine.


INT. FILTHY APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ordell and Raynelle sit on the couch watching Def Comedy
Jam; neither one is laughing. Raynelle's too stoned.
Ordell's too tense. The phone rings, he jumps on it

ORDELL
Hello.


INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT

Max on the other end behind his desk. Winston sitting on
the edge of the desk listening.

MAX
I've been looking for you.

Ordell's up and off the couch pacing.

ORDELL
You know who this is?

MAX
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the
ten thousand you put up. Isn't that
why you called.

Ordell doesn't say anything.

MAX (CONT'D)
The bond collateral on Beaumont
Livingston you moved over to cover
Miss Brown, remember?

ORDELL
She got off, huh?

MAX
They decided to no-file. Tell me
where you are and I'll bring you your
money.

Ordell doesn't say anything.

MAX (CONT'D)
You still there?

ORDELL
Looky here, I know you helped her and
I know you know what I want Jackie
can tell me any story come in that
pretty head of hers. Long as at the
end of that story, she hands over my
money. She do that, we're still
friends. Now, she don't wanna be my
friend no more, tell her to think
about ol' Louis. And if she tries to
turn me in, I'll name her ass as my
accessory. We'll go upstate together.
Hand in handcuffed hand. Now that
shit's a promise, understand what I'm
sayin'? You tell her that, and I'll
call you back.

Ordell hangs up. Back in control. He looks to the TV. One
of the COMEDIANS cracks a joke. Ordell laughs.

Max looks at Winston.

MAX
You're right, that was Ordell. You
have time, you think you could find
out for me where he's staying?

WINSTON
Cops can't locate him, huh?

MAX
They don't have your winning
personality.

WINSTON
Sure thing. I don't have to know what
I'm doing, long as you know.

MAX
I think I do. Is that good enough?


EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

A low-rent motel. We hear a phone ring inside one of the
rooms.


INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Jackie lies on a hotel bed, wearing a long t-shirt and
panties, watching TV that's chained to the wall.

She answers the phone.

JACKIE
Hello.


INT. MAX'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Max on the phone in his office, alone.

MAX
I know where he is.

This gets her attention. She picks up the remote to the
TV set and zaps the sound.

JACKIE
How'd you find out?

MAX
All Winston had to do was ask around.
Ordell's living in Long Beach with a
woman junkie.

JACKIE
How does Winston find him if A.T.F.
and all the local Police can't?

MAX
People talk to Winston. He's street,
same as them, they trust him. They
get busted, they know somebody who
can bond them out. I thought I might
drop in on him. He'll no doubt be
surprised to see me.

JACKIE
He's liable to shoot you.

MAX
On the phone I told him I have the
ten thousand he put up for your bond.
I could bring the money and the
papers for him to sign. Walk out and
call the Sheriff's department.

Jackie gets off the bed.

JACKIE
Ray wants him.

MAX
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide
suspect. It doesn't matter who brings
him in, he's gonna name you as an
accessory.

Jackie lights up a Davidoff.

JACKIE
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the
case. I'm their witness. They
wouldn't have a case without me. If
it's his word against mine, who are
they gonna believe?

MAX
It's not that simple.

Phone in one hand, smoke in the other, Jackie begins
pacing back and forth.

JACKIE
It never was, so I'm not gonna start
worrying about it now. Look, Ray more
or less believes my story, and he
more or less doesn't care. All he
really gives a shit about is getting
Ordell.

MAX
So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet?

JACKIE
Get Ordell to come to your office.

MAX
Set him up.

JACKIE
Uh-huh.

MAX
Tell him you want to see him?

JACKIE
Tell him I want to give him his
money.

MAX
Why?

JACKIE
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of
him. He'll like that.

MAX
What do you tell Nicolet?

JACKIE
Ordell called and wants to meet me
and I'm scared.

MAX
We get Ordell to come to my office.
Nicolet - is he already there, or
does he come busting in while we're
chatting?

Jackie takes a drag.

JACKIE
He's already there.

MAX
What if he hears something he's not
supposed to?

JACKIE
Well, we don't let that happen, now
do we?


EXT. FILTHY APARTMENT - NIGHT

Max at the front door or Raynelle's apartment. He pounds
on the door.

Ordell throws open the door.

ORDELL
What the fuck you doin' knockin on
the door like the goddamn police? You
lookin' to get shot?

MAX
I thought you might be asleep.

ORDELL
You keep fuckin' with me, you're
gonna be asleep forever.

He looks past Max.

MAX
I'm alone.

ORDELL
Git your ass in here.

Max enters, Ordell slams the door.

As Ordell turns away from the door, Maxis reaching into
his coat. Ordell brings his Beretta up at Max.

ORDELL
You better freeze, motherfucker!

Max freezes, his hand in his coat pocket.

MAX
You want your money? Your bond
refund?

He takes his hand out, it's holding stack of bills
wrapped in a rubber band. He tosses it to Ordell, who
catches it with his free hand.

ORDELL
That's all?

MAX
I have a bond receipt for you to
sign.

ORDELL
You know what the fuck I'm talkin'
about. You talk to her?

MAX
She wants to give you your money. If
she didn't, there'd be cops batter-
ramming the door right now.

ORDELL
How'd you find me?

MAX
Winston found you.

ORDELL
How the fuck did he find me?

MAX
That's what Winston does. He finds
people who don't want to be found.

ORDELL
Well, bully for that nigga. You say
she wants to give me the money, huh?

MAX
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
Well, give it to me then.

MAX
She wants to give it to you herself
and collect her ten percent. She also
wants to explain why she had to hold
on to it.

ORDELL
I'd like to hear that too. Turn
around and put your hands on your
head.

Max does this, Ordell pats him down.

MAX
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd
already tried to get Jackie to go in
with her, split the half million
amongst themselves. What she did was
take quite a risk to see you get your
money.

ORDELL
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?

MAX
All I did was walk out with it.

ORDELL
And you did that to protect my
interest?

MAX
In a way, yes.

ORDELL
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a
dumbass. Go sit over there on the
couch.

Max does.

MAX
This place stinks.

ORDELL
You get used to it after a while. Now
tell me where my money's at.

MAX
My office.

ORDELL
And where's Jackie?

MAX
She's been there since Thursday
night.

ORDELL
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she
home?

MAX
She was afraid.

ORDELL
(laughs)
That I gotta see.

MAX
She still is. She doesn't want to get
shot before she can tell you what
happened.

ORDELL
Have her bring the money here.

MAX
It's in the safe. She can't get at
it.

ORDELL
Call her, tell her the combination.

MAX
I'm telling you, you got her spooked.
She won't leave there till you have
your money and you're gone.

ORDELL
You expect me to just walk in there?

MAX
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be
in custody right now. When you said
you'd name her as an accessory she
believed you. That scares her more
than anything.

ORDELL
That's why she's givin' up my money
huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie.
I didn't trust her ass neither, but I
knew how to handle her. She was my
blonde-headed little surfer gal. I
fuckin' told Louis he could've just
given her a punch in the mouth, he
didn't need to shoot her. She's at
your office.

MAX
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
By herself. That big mandingo nigga
Winston ain't there, is he?

MAX
She's all alone.

ORDELL
I call your office, she better answer
the phone.

MAX
She will.


INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT

Jackie on the phone with Ordell, sitting behind Max's
desk.

JACKIE
I'll be here. Se ya' in a bit.

She hangs up the phone. Then starts dialing again...


INT. RAY NICOLET'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A STEDICAM glides through the apartment, it falls on a
beeper "beeping", a gun, a wallet and car keys on a
dresser drawer... it leaves that and lands on a TV
screen: Tom Snyder is interviewing a guest on his show
... it leaves that and falls on two empty and one quarter-
filled beer bottles... it leaves that and falls on a
sleeping Ray Nicolet passed out in his reclining chair.
The sound of Tom Snyder and the faint beeping are heard
offscreen.


EXT. FILTHY APARTMENT - NIGHT

They leave the apartment walking to Max's car.

ORDELL
All the time I've known her, I never
heard her sound scared like that.
Ordinarily she's too cool for school.
I'm driving, gimme the keys.

Max hands him the keys. They climb in.


INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT

Jackie sitting behind the desk. She opens the drawer to
her right, Max's .38 sits there. She closes the drawer.


INT. CADILLAC (MOVING) - NIGHT

Ordell behind the wheel, Max the passenger. Ordell plays
the radio, he likes the song and turns it up.


BACK TO JACKIE

Sitting alone in the office, she gets up and turns off
the lights. The office goes dark. No music.


BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX

The song plays LOUD. Ordell moves his head to the music
slightly. Mak sits silently in the passenger seat,
sneaking a look at Ordell every once in a while.


BACK TO JACKIE

Sitting behind Max's desk in the dark. She takes out her
Davidoffs and lights one up with her Bic. Her face is
illuminated for a moment - then it's out. She exhales a
drag. No music.


BACK TO ORDELL

CLOSEUP ORDELL

His face is ice, the music is LOUD.


BACK TO JACKIE

CLOSEUP JACKIE

She's cool as a breeze, smoking her brand. No music.


BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX

Music is LOUD. Ordell's driving. Max says;

MAX
It's the next street.

ORDELL
I know where it is.

MAX
Turn left.

ORDELL
I know where to turn.


BACK TO JACKIE

Sitting behind Max's desk. Headlights shine in the
window. She is lit by them. She puts out her Davidoff and
sits back in the chair. The light source cuts off.


BACK TO ORDELL AND MAX

Sitting in the parked Cadillac. Ordell has just turned
off the lights and turns to Max, Beretta in hand.

ORDELL
My money's in that office, right?

MAX
Uh-huh.

ORDELL
She starts givin' me some bullshit
about it ain't there. It's somewhere
else and we can go get it.
(he holds up his Beretta)
I'm shootin' you in the head right
then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot
her in the kneecap, find out where my
godamn money is. I go walkin' in
there and that nigga Winston or
anybody else is in there, you're the
first man shot, understand what I'm
sayin'?

MAX
Yeah.

ORDELL
Now, is there anything you want to
tell me before we get out of this
car?

MAX
No.

ORDELL
You sure?

MAX
Yes.

ORDELL
You better be, motherfucker.


EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - NIGHT

They both get out of the Cadillac. Ordell sticks his gun
in his pants.

ORDELL
Get ahead of me and open the door.

Max steps in front of him, puts his keys in the lock and
opens the door.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Step inside easy.

Max does.

Max sees; Jackie sitting at his desk in the dark.

Ordell sees this, too and moves past Max.

ORDELL (CONT'D)
Hey, girl, what the hell you sitting
in the goddamn dark for?

Max sees; Ordell moves past him... then he sees the
bathroom door on the left side of the desk open, throwing
light into the room, onto Jackie and the figure who steps
out of the bathroom... Mark Dargus.

Max sees; Ordell looks to Dargus, then back to Jackie.
Then Jackie says;

JACKIE
Mark...
(raising her voice)
... he's got a gun!

Max sees; Ordell almost jumps, his arm goes to the
Beretta in his pants...

... just as Dargus raises his gun and SHOOTS him three
times in the chest...

... Ordell drops o the ground like a sack of potatoes, he
lands at Max's feet.

Max looks down and sees Ordell's head by his shoes, look
of panic still on his face, dead as fried chicken.

Max sees Dargus come over, bending on one nee next to
Ordell's body.

Max looks over at Jackie, still behind the desk. She
looks eyes with Max for a moment, then stands and walks
over to the body.

Then Max sees ONE SHERIFF DEPUTY step out of the dark
holding a shogun ... then another... then Winston step
out of the bathroom.

DARGUS
He's dead.

Dargus looks up at Max;

DARGUS (CONT'D)
Does he have the marked bills on him?

Max still shaken;

MAX
In his inside coat pocket.

Dargus reaches in and pulls out the envelope containing
the forty-thousand marked dollars.

Max looks at Jackie.

She looks down at the dead Ordell with no expression,
just light up another Davidoff.

Dargus looks up at Max;

DARGUS
Why were you with him?

MAX
I went to give him his refund, so he
wouldn't have to come here.

DARGUS
How'd you know where he was?

MAX
I found out.

DARGUS
And you didn't tell the Police?

MAX
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you
wanted him.

Dargus looks down at he man he just killed.

JACKIE
Remember when Ray said you hoped
you'd get him before he got me?

Dargus looks up and nods his head.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Well, you did. Thank you.

She takes a drag on her Davidoff.

FADE TO BLACK


INT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY

As opposed to the last scene late at night, it's early
morning. Max sits at his desk, filling out a report.

A SUB-TITLE APPEARS BELOW:

"TEN DAYS LATER"

Max hears someone go;

JACKIE (O.S.)
Knock knock.

Max looks up and sees Jackie Brown, standing in the
doorway. She smiles at him.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Hey.

MAX FLASHES ON Jackie behind the desk.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Mark... he's got a gun!

Dargus shoots Ordell, Ordell drops.


BACK TO OFFICE

Max smiles back.

MAX
Hey, you.

Jackie walks toward him.

JACKIE
I got your package. It was fun
getting a half-a-million dollars in
the mail.

MAX
Less ten percent.

JACKIE
Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that
out, since there wasn't no note.

She sits in the chair in front of his desk.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.

MAX
I hesitated taking that much.

JACKIE
You worked for it - if you're sure that's all
you want.

MAX
I'm sure.

Pause between them.

JACKIE
I'm leaving, I have my things in my
car. Why don't you walk out with me?
I want to show you something.

Max hesitates.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
Come on, Max. I won't hurt you.

He smiles and gets up from the desk.

As she stands, Jackie says;

JACKIE (CONT'D)
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he
pissed he missed all the excitement.

MAX
What's he doing?

JACKIE
He's on to a new thing. He's after a
guy who owns a gun shop he says is
"woefully and wantonly" selling
assault rifles to minors. He says
he's gonna take him down if it's the
last thing he does.

MAX
Did you tell him you were leaving?

JACKIE
I told him I might.


EXT. CHERRY BAIL BONDS - DAY

They walk outside and Max sees Ordell's black Mercedes
convertible.

MAX
That's Ordell's.

JACKIE
They've confiscated all his other
stuff. But this one's sorta left
over. The registration's in the glove
box, the keys were under the seat...
What's a matter" haven't you ever
borrowed someone's car?

MAX
Not after they're dead.

She walks around to the other side of the car, and looks
at him across the black Mercedes.

JACKIE
I didn't use you, Max.

MAX
I didn't say you did.

JACKIE
I never lied to you.

MAX
I know.

JACKIE
We're partners.

MAX
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't
blame anybody for anything I do.

JACKIE
Do you blame yourself for helping me?

He shakes his head 'no.'

JACKIE (CONT'D)
'd feel a whole lot better if you
took some more money.

MAX
(smiling)
You'll get over that.

Jackie smiles.

MAX (CONT'D)
Where're you going?

JACKIE
Spain.

MAX
Madrid or Barcelona?

JACKIE
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?

He shakes his head 'no.'

JACKIE (CONT'D)
I hear they don't eat dinner till
midnight.

Max doesn't say anything.

JACKIE
Wanna go?

MAX
Thanks, but you have a good time.

JACKIE
Sure I can't twist your arm?

MAX
Thank you for saying that, but no. My
business.

JACKIE
I thought you were tired of your
business?

MAX
I'm just tired in general.

JACKIE
Are you scared of me?

Max smiles and holds up two fingers, close to each other.

MAX
A little bit.

Jackie smiles back.

JACKIE
Come over here.

Max does.

They give each other a long, tender kiss.

She breaks it.

JACKIE (CONT'D)
I'll send you a postcard, partner.

Brannon Braga   Ronald D. Moore


First Draft

September 29, 1995





1   A BLACK VOID                                                 1

We can hear movement. Strange skittering sounds, like
razor-claws on metal... the hiss of pneumatic hoses...
the whirr and click of servos... liquid gurgling... an
eerie, alien cacophony.

2   EARTH                                                        2

appears, hanging now in the starry blackness. The
alien noises continue, and far in the distance we hear
the muffled THUMP of what could be a distant explosion.
Alien TEXT suddenly appears next to Earth, and we
REVEAL we are in --

3   INT. BORG RECON CENTER                                       3

The image of Earth is actually on a monitor, which is
only one of DOZENS of MONITORS covering a huge wall.
We don't see anything of the rest of the room, but the
technology in view is distinctly alien and bizarre --
a mixture of organic and mechanical elements.
Circuitry and optical cabling are side-by-side with
what looks almost like arteries and organs. We can
still hear the creepy skittering and gurgling noises.
Occasionally, a SHADOWY FORM sweeps past the camera,
vaguely humanoid but we can't tell who or what it is.

All of the monitors are active, and they present myriad
IMAGES and SOUND -- all related to EARTH HISTORY. The
screens show everything from written Chinese... to
Renaissance paintings... to black and white newsreel
footage of World War Two... to what look like clips of
space battles from the 24th century. The entire range
of human history dancing across the monitors. The
effect is dizzying -- we get the feeling that whoever
is watching this is studying the human race.

There is another THUMP and the wall of monitors
SHUDDERS slightly. We hear the VOICE of what we will
come to know as the BORG COLLECTIVE -- thousands of
voices speaking at once :

BORG
Restrict search parameters to 1-9-
9-8 through 2-0-8-4.

The images on the monitors now change to show us images
from 21ST CENTURY Earth history.

Again, it's a collection of still photography, video
footage, text, artwork, etc. We hear snippets of sound-
bites, music, speeches from the period. A lot of
enticing details. As the images race across the
monitors, we should learn the following.

-- The turn of the 21st century brought chaos.
Regional wars, the collapse of the United Nations.
Societal break-down. Crime, starvation, desperation.

-- A Third World War. Nuclear explosions,
environmental disasters, tens of millions dead. The
United States ceases to exist. All political authority
vanishes. Humanity teetering on the edge of the Second
Dark Age.

-- The image of a single man -- ZEPHRAM COCHRANE. A
visionary scientist. He see the spacecraft he created
out of a nuclear missile. He flies the first warp
test, breaking the light barrier. It changes history.

-- Grainy black and white images of a VULCAN SCOUT SHIP
landing on Earth. They saw Cochrane's flight, followed
him back to Earth, and made First Contact with the
human race.

-- Humanity turns the corner. First Contact with an
alien civilization brings the planet together as never
before. Humans and Vulcans working together, beginning
to solve long-standing problems with new technology.
We see an early replicator producing food for the
starving millions. A new World Government is formed.

-- People from planet Earth and people from Vulcan form
an Alliance. They call it the United Federation of
Planets. And they commission a fleet of starships for
protection and exploration. They call it Starfleet.

-- These are images recounting the birth of the Star
Trek universe.

Another muffled EXPLOSION, this one stronger, SHAKES
the entire wall. One of the monitors BLOWS OUT in a
shower of sparks. And now a new voice, a woman's
voice, low, threatening, with a slight metallic
inflection, speaks for the first time:

WOMAN'S VOICE
Stop search. Calculate temporal
coordinates. J-Fourteen.

Another explosion ROCKS the room and it takes us to:

4   EXT. SPACE - A BORG SPHERE                                   4

A huge, spherical Borg warship as it takes a phaser
shot from an unseen vessel. The BLAST smashes into the
Borg Sphere, but the massive ship continues. The
Sphere returns FIRE. FOLLOW the Borg fire to --

5   A FEDERATION STARSHIP                                        5

locked in battle with the Borg Sphere. The Borg fire
DESTROYS the Federation ship in a fiery blast.

6   NEW ANGLE                                                    6

as the Borg Sphere flies away from the wreckage of the
decimated starship, and as it does, we reveal that this
is just one small part of --

7   A MASSIVE SPACE BATTLE                                       7

involving dozens of Starfleet and Borg vessels, engaged
in a fierce FIREFIGHT as far as the eye can see. Ships
turning, twisting, firing, exploding. Lots of movement.
It's a spectacular sight.

The Borg Sphere is moving away from the battle, heading
off in another direction.

8   NEW ANGLE                                                    8

In the middle of the battle. A BORG CUBE is attacking
a smaller Federation starship. The starship is taking
quite a beating... explosions all along the hull... it
doesn't look like it can take much  more of this.

Suddenly a spread of FOUR TORPEDOES come blazing in
from O.C. The torpedoes SLAM into the Borg ship,
causing massive damage.

9   THE USS ENTERPRISE NCC 1701-E                                9

SOARS into view and moves to protect the beleaguered
starship.

The Enterprise is Starfleet's newest and most powerful
vessel. An elegant and majestic ship. But unlike the
last Enterprise, Starfleet has opted for a more
muscular vessel and the hull is studded with weapons
and other defensive armory. We get the feeling this
Enterprise is ready for anything.

10   INT. ENTERPRISE-E - BRIDGE                                  10

The Bridge has been redesigned. A single Captain's
chair dominates the room, and surrounding consoles and
stations all face inward instead of out, giving Picard
instant access to his officers. PICARD in the
Captain's chair. RIKER at a new Ops station. DATA at
the helm. WORF at Tactical. TROI at Communications,
various CREWMEMBERS at their posts. The ship is at Red
Alert and everyone is tense.

PICARD
Signal the Endeavor to fall back.
We'll cover them.

TROI
Aye, sir.

She works her console.

11   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE   BORG SHIP                     11

The Endeavor moves off as the Borg FIRE at the
Enterprise and BLASTS the saucer section. This should
also produce an unusual effect -- instead of the
traditional "bubble" shielding, the new armor of this
Enterprise ABSORBS the blast and dissipates the energy
across the hull. The ship is undamaged.

12   INT. BRIDGE                                                 12

The ship is ROCKED by the blast.

DATA
Dispersive armor is holding.

PICARD
Bring us about. Target Borg ship
alpha four, port side battery.

WORF
Port battery, ready sir!

PICARD
Fire.

As RAPID PHASER SHOTS leap out from half a dozen points
along the ship's port side. (NOTE: The phasers also
look different, more along the lines of a gatling gun).
The Borg Cube EXPLODES. The Enterprise flies through
the debris.

14   INT. BRIDGE                                                 14

PICARD
Starboard battery -- fire.

15   EXT. SPACE                                                  15

The Enterprise fires a burst of phasers -- but this
time, the phasers have no effect. We see a strange
SHIELDING appears around the Borg ship.

16   INT. BRIDGE                                                 16

On the main viewer, the massive Borg ship looms closer.

DATA
The Borg ship has modified its
shields, Captain. Our phasers
will no longer be effective.

PICARD
Ready quantum torpedo.

WORF
Aye, sir. Only three left.

Another JOLT as we're hit.

GEORDI'S COM VOICE

Where GEORDI and N.D. Engineers are rushing about, hard
at work. Geordi is no longer wearing his VISOR -- he
now has artificial ocular implants for eyes. They have
a distinctive electronic look to them.

GEORDI
Captain, I'm starting to worry
about the hull integrity. We've
been running the support field at
full power for three hours
straight. I don't know how much
longer it's going to hold up.

PICARD
Understood. Keep me informed.

18   INT. BRIDGE                                                 18

The Borg cube is huge on the main viewer as the
Enterprise rushes toward it.

TROI
Incoming transmission from the
Borg.

PICARD
On screen.

Data works and the viewer changes to a view of the
INTERIOR of the BORG CUBE. A vast CHAMBER crammed with
HUNDREDS of BORG DRONES standing upright in individual
alcoves. They're everywhere -- on the ceiling, walls,
floor. This is a BORG COLLECTIVE -- hundreds of Borg
that form a gigantic "hive" mind. The Borg are half-
man half machine. No individual personalities. No
feelings. They have only one goal in life: to
assimilate new races into their collective. To become
a Borg is to experience living death. When they speak,
they speak as a collective -- thousands of voices
speaking as one:

BORG
Your defense perimeter is
useless. You will be assimilated.

PICARD
(to Borg)
Break off your attack. By now,
you must realize you can't win...

BORG
Your opinion is irrelevant. We
are the Borg. Resistance is
futile.

PICARD
We'll see about that...
(to Worf)
Fire.

Worf works.

19   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - CLOSE ON TORPEDO BAY          19

A QUANTUM TORPEDO BLASTS out of the launcher and heads
toward the Borg cube. This torpedo is completely
different than the traditional photon torpedo. It
oscillates and changes shape and color as it streaks
toward the Borg ship.

20   THE BORG SHIP                                               20

as the quantum torpedo HITS IT. But instead of
exploding on the surface, the torpedo PIERCES the ship
like an armor-piercing shell and momentarily VANISHES
from view. The ship then EXPLODES like a star going
supernova -- bright light and shock waves.

21   INT. BRIDGE                                                 21

The ship is ROCKED violently by the shock wave. People
hanging on.

DATA
Main power still on-line, Captain.

Riker looks at his console.

RIKER
Casualties are light, Captain.
Minor buckling on the port
nacelle. Nothing serious.

WORF
Incoming message from the Starship
Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.

PICARD
On screen.

The viewer shows ADMIRAL HAYES on the Bridge of his
starship.

ADMIRAL HAYES
The new quantum torpedoes are
doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've
destroyed forty-seven Borg ships
so far... and only lost fifteen of
our own.
(beat)
But one of the Borg ships has
broken through our defenses, and
it's heading directly for Earth.
Can you handle it?

PICARD
Absolutely.

ADMIRAL HAYES
Good hunting. Hayes out.

PICARD
Mister Data, set a pursuit course.
Maximum warp.

23   EXT. SPACE - EARTH                                          23

There are Starfleet satellites and space stations in
close orbit. The Borg Sphere seen before enters frame.
The satellites open fire, but they have little effect
on the massive Borg Sphere, which returns fire,
EXPLODING them in orbit.

The Sphere heads down toward the Earth...

24   INT. BRIDGE                                                 24

DATA
We are approaching the Terran
System, Captain.

PICARD
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg
ship?

DATA
It has entered Earth orbit.
(off console)
Correction -- it is not in orbit.
It is heading directly toward the
surface.

PICARD
What?

Picard gets up, moves to Data's console.

RIKER
(incredulous)
Some sort of suicide tactic?

DATA
Unknown, sir. Suicide tactics are
not normally associated with the
Borg.

Data reacts to his console.

DATA
Sensors show a temporal signature
emanating from the Sphere. High
concentrations of tachyons...

Picard studies Data's monitor.

PICARD
And chronometric particles... it's
as though they're trying to create
a temporal vortex...

A beat as Picard makes a shocking realization.

PICARD
Time travel... they're attempting
time travel...

Full power, Mister Data. Worf,
quantum torpedoes at my command!

WORF
Aye, sir.

A temporal vortex is forming
directly ahead of the Sphere.

28   EXT. EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE                                     28

Just ahead of the Sphere we see a TEMPORAL VORTEX
opening -- a maelstrom of light and energy stretching
into infinity. ENERGY explodes from the vortex as the
Sphere begins to go inside...

29   THE ENTERPRISE                                              29

as it's HIT by the tremendous energy blast from the
vortex. The ship spins around, nearly rips apart.

30   INT. BRIDGE                                                 30

Everyone THROWN to the deck. Consoles sparking. Power
failing. SHAKING.

RIKER
Main power off-line!

Riker checks a console.

RIKER
We're caught in some kind of

PICARD
Worf... torpedo... now!

Worf works...

31   EXT. EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE                                     31

Another QUANTUM TORPEDO is launched from the
Enterprise. But just before it hits the Borg Sphere,
the Sphere VANISHES inside the vortex. The torpedo
hits the roiling energy of the Vortex and detonates
with a harmless flash. The Vortex itself starts
COLLAPSING...

32   INT. BRIDGE                                                 32

The shaking subsides.

I have helm control.

PICARD
Where's the Sphere?

WORF
They have traveled into the

Disturbed reactions.

DATA
The vortex is collapsing, sir.

PICARD
Contact Starfleet Command.

WORF
No response.
(reacts to console)
I'm not reading any Starfleet com
traffic in this entire sector.

TROI
(off console)
Captain, I've scanned the planet.
The atmosphere contains a high
concentration of methane, carbon
monoxide and fluorine. The oceans
have been chemically altered, as
well.

PICARD
On screen.

She works, and on the View screen EARTH appears as seen
from orbit. The crystal blue marble is now covered by
a thick, turbulent DARK ATMOSPHERE -- polluted and
ugly. Reactions.

PICARD
Life signs?

TROI
Population... thirty-five

(reacts)
All Borg.

A shocking moment.

DATA
(off console)
The planet's surface is covered
with Borg technology.
(beat)
So is the moon... and three other
planets in this solar system.

TROI
But how?

PICARD
They must've done it in the
past... they went back and
changed history...

RIKER
(stunned)
They did it... they assimilated
Earth.

WORF
But if they changed history...
then why are we still here?

DATA
We were caught in the temporal
wake from the vortex. It must
have protected us from any changes
in the time-line.

Worf's console sounds an alarm.

WORF
Captain, there are five Borg ships
closing in on our position.

PICARD
(making a decision)
Data, set a course for that
vortex.

TROI
Captain...?

PICARD
We have to follow them back...
repair whatever damage they've
done to that time-line.

DATA
(working)
Course laid in. Engaging impulse
engines.

The ship is suddenly ROCKED.

33   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE   BORG SHIPS (OPTICAL)              33

The Enterprise is being chased by FIVE BORG SHIPS as it
heads down toward the planet. The Borg vessels FIRE on
the Enterprise.

WORF
Borg vessels are closing to two

The ship is HIT AGAIN AND AGAIN. On the View Screen,
we're nearly on the vortex, but it's closing fast.

PICARD
Take us in!

36   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE   VORTEX (OPTICAL)                  36

The Enterprise just barely makes it inside the vortex

37   EXT. SPACE                                                  37

An empty star field. Suddenly, the VORTEX APPEARS and
the Enterprise comes ROARING out into space. The
vortex VANISHES behind the ship.

38   INT. BRIDGE                                                 38

The shaking subsides. Everyone exchanges a look, tries
to re-orient themselves.

PICARD

RIKER
We're still in Earth orbit.

PICARD

PICARD
What year is it?

DATA
(working)
According to our astrometric
readings... the year is 2063.

WORF
Captain, I've found the Borg
Sphere. It's on the far side of
the planet...firing at the
surface.

PICARD
(to Data)
Intercept course, full impulse.
(to Worf)
Weapons status?

WORF
Phasers are off-line... we have
two quantum torpedoes left. But
the computer targeting system has
been destroyed.

PICARD
Go to manual.

Worf pops open a panel and a high-tech TARGETING console
emerges with a small MONITOR and a traditional CROSS-
HAIR in the center. Worf grabs the targeting hand-
controls -- futuristic joysticks.

40   EXT. SPACE - THE BORG SPHERE                                40

The ship is FIRING its weapons down toward the planet

41   INT. BRIDGE                                                 41

As before. Worf works his controls. A complex array
of grids, coordinate information, speed data, and other
weapons info on the monitor screen. He begins trying
to focus the cross-hairs on the Sphere.

PICARD
(over above action, to
Troi)
Track their weapons fire.

TROI

Western hemisphere... North
American continent...

DATA
We are within torpedo range.

RIKER
They've seen us. They're taking
evasive action.

PICARD

Mister Worf?

Worf struggles with the targeting system.

WORF
Target...

The crosshairs keep missing the image of the Borg
Sphere, which is now twisting and turning to evade us.
Troi reacts to her console.

TROI
Captain, they're firing at a
nuclear missile silo... in central
Montana.

WORF
(struggling)
Target...

PICARD
(worried)
Montana...

The crosshairs finally LOCK on the Borg Sphere.

WORF
Target locked!

PICARD
Fire!

42   EXT. SPACE - THE BORG SPHERE                                42

The quantum torpedo streaks in from off-camera and
slams into the Borg ship. It penetrates the Sphere as
seen before... a long beat... and then it EXPLODES.

43   INT. BRIDGE                                                 43

As everyone reacts to the destruction of the Sphere.
But Picard has no time for celebration.

PICARD
(to Data)
Mister Data, I want to know the
exact date and time.
(to Riker)
Give me a damage report on that
missile silo.

DATA
(works)
Today is March second, 2063. The
time in Montana is oh-eight-forty-
five.

RIKER
(works)
Looks like they damaged the
silo...

PICARD
Life signs?

RIKER
Can't tell. Long-range bio-
sensors are off-line.

Picard thinks for a moment... makes an instant decision
and turns to Worf.

PICARD
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister
La Forge and a security team meet
me in Transporter Room Three.
Civilian clothes.

WORF
Aye, sir.

Worf works. Riker turns to him, curious.

RIKER
Captain?

PICARD
In twenty-four hours, Zephram
Cochrane is supposed to conduct
the very first warp test... from
a missile silo in Montana. If I'm
right, the Borg were trying to
change the course of human history
by killing him or destroying his
ship.

RIKER
(nods in understanding)
And if they succeed, humans won't
make First Contact with the
Vulcans tomorrow.
(beat)
As First Officer I should be the
one beaming down...

PICARD
Normally, I would agree. But in
this case, the mission requires a
certain knowledge of 21st century
history. You're many things,
Number One, but you're not much of
an historian.

He grins slightly, has to agree.

RIKER
Good luck, sir.

PICARD
I'll keep in contact. You have
the Bridge.

Picard EXITS...

CUT TO:

44   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM                                       44

Picard, Geordi and THREE SECURITY GUARDS are checking
their phasers and tricorders. Everyone is wearing civilian
clothes. Geordi has a large engineering kit... Transporter
Chief pulling on a civilian jacket. She looks a little
frazzled - it's been a long day in Sickbay.

BEVERLY
Will somebody please tell me where
we're going?

Beverly joins them on the pad.

PICARD
Montana.

GEORDI
(off tricorder)
I have the silo, sir. Bearing
three one zero... distance, three
hundred meters.

PICARD
Let's go.

They start walking...

BEVERLY
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going
to tell me what we're doing here?

PICARD
We're here to find Zephram
Cochrane. He may be injured or
dead.

BEVERLY
Cochrane... the inventor of warp
drive?

PICARD
Yes...

BEVERLY
But he's been dead for three
hundred...
(realizes, long sigh)
Oh God... we've gone back in time
again, haven't we?

PICARD
I'm afraid so. If the Borg
succeed in preventing First
Contact with the Vulcans... Earth
will remain in the Second Dark
Age... an easy target when the
Borg arrive in the 24th century.

BEVERLY
Well, why didn't you just say so
in the first place?

Picard gives her a look. As they keep walking...

WIDEN to REVEAL Troi and Data. Data is holding back
the sheet while Troi scans the body with a tricorder.
There is repair work going on in the b.g. Two medical
N.D.s stand by.

TROI
It appears death was caused by a
plasma discharge.
(beat)
I'll note in her record that she
never left her post.

Troi glances at Data, who is clearly disturbed by the
sight of the dead woman, holding his EMOTIONS in check
with difficulty.

TROI
Did you know her?

DATA
Not very well. We met shortly
after the Enterprise-E was
commissioned. I found her to be
a most... promising officer.

Troi looks at him in concern.

TROI
Data... are you sure you're all
right?

DATA
I am still having difficulty
integrating certain emotions into
my programming. Grief, loss,
remorse...

TROI
We still have to make reports on
ten more crewmen killed in action.
Maybe you should deactivate your
emotion chip until we're done.

Data considers.

DATA
No. Human beings do not have that
luxury, and neither should I.

TROI
I will admit... there are times

Data and ENSIGN PORTER ENTER through a set of doors.
The lights are off in the room, dim. This is a large
room crammed with many conduits, gas tanks, 24th
century machinery and monitors. It's normally unmanned --
this is where oxygen, gravity, heat, and other
environmental conditions of the ship are controlled.
In a far corner of the room a CONDUIT leading to a
series of high-pressure TANKS labeled "D-O2" has
ruptured and is SPEWING a corrosive, poisonous GAS.

Data scans it with his tricorder.

DATA
(to Porter)
One of the diathermic oxygen tanks
has been damaged.

PORTER
(shocked)
Diathermic oxygen?

DATA
It is a new subsystem of Nova
Class ships. It regulates
hydropressure and temperature
variance.
(beat)
Remain here. The gas is highly
corrosive to organic material. It
would liquefy your flesh on
contact.

PORTER
Be my guest, sir.

Data walks over to the spewing gas tank, and without
concern shoves both hands into the corrosive gas...

... groping around for the broken conduit, finally grabs
hold of it... and with android strength BENDS the metal
conduit back into the bulkhead. The gas stops leaking.
Data is completely unaffected by the corrosive gas.

DATA
(to Porter)
Begin a diagnostic on the safety
interlocks. There appears to have
been some damage during the
attack.

PORTER
Right.

Porter moves around a corner, behind some equipment,
out of Data's vision...

51   NEW ANGLE - PORTER                                          51

who opens a PANEL on the wall. But instead of the neat
and orderly Starfleet technology, he is confronted by
a bizarre amalgam of organic and mechanical cabling,
diodes and what almost look like arteries. Some of the
tubes are pulsing with fluids and energy. Porter
reacts.

PORTER
What the hell...

Porter pulls aside a large conduit and stops. Buried
deep within the tangle of bio-circuits is what looks
like a HUMAN FACE covered with cybernetic tubes and
chips. It's barely discernable in the darkness and
clutter. Porter isn't even sure what he's looking at.
He leans in for a closer look... and suddenly the eyes
open.

off camera. He takes a few steps in that direction.

DATA
Ensign Porter?

He stands there for a moment, puzzled. Then a faint
SKITTERING SCRAPE can be heard -- like tiny claws on a
metal surface. He  whirls at the sound.

DATA
Ensign... are you all right?

No response. Data walks around the now deathly quiet
room... turns the corner to where Porter was working.
He's gone. The open panel is still there, and there
doesn't appear to be any place Porter could've gone.
Data looks puzzled, takes a step forward when his boots
make a squishing sound. He looks down...

Data to Bridge.

No response.

DATA
Data to Security.

This is Lieutenant Data to anyone

Nothing. Data quickly turns and heads for the door.
There's a metallic SCRAPE above him and he looks up --

53   TWO BORG                                                    53

pounce. One of them has Porter and appears to be
inserting some horrible Borg device into his head.
Before Data can react, the second Borg suddenly lunges
at Data.

54   EXT. MONTANA PLAINS - MISSILE SILO - DAY                    54

The SILO is buried deep underground, but on the surface
there is a large, poured concrete MISSILE DOOR.

Built to withstand a nuclear blast, the door has
nevertheless been badly charred and damaged by the Borg
attack from orbit. There are large, smoking CRATERS
all around. Part of the ground seems to have COLLAPSED
to a depth of ten feet, like a sinkhole nearby. Picard
and his team approach.

GEORDI
This must be it.

PICARD
How serious is the damage?

GEORDI
(off tricorder)
I'm having trouble scanning
underground. There's a lot of
radiation leaking from something.

PICARD
Probably from the nuclear warhead.
Cochrane was planning to use it to
ignite the warp drive.

As they speak, Beverly pulls out a hypospray and gives
everyone injections.

BEVERLY
This will protect us from the
radiation.

Geordi moves to the thick, concrete missile door, scans
it.

GEORDI
I'm picking up faint life signs
twenty meters below.

PICARD
There should be an access hatch
nearby...

Everyone spreads out... looking for the hatch. One of
the guards -- LANGE -- finds it.

LANGE
Over here.

Everyone rushes over to him. There's a small HATCH on
the ground that has been partially hidden by weeds and
brush. Geordi kneels down, starts working a complex-
looking LOCK on the hatch.

GEORDI
Alphanumeric lock. We need a
password to get in...

PICARD
I have the password right here.

Picard pulls out his phaser and everyone steps back.
He aims and FIRES at the hatch, which is BLOWN OPEN,
revealing a ladder that leads down into the darkness.
As they start to crawl inside...

55   INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTROL ROOM                            55

This is the "mission control" for Cochrane's test site.
The underground room is filled with 21st century
equipment, consoles and monitors. One entire wall of
the room is dominated by a huge METAL BLAST DOOR, which
is now closed. We will learn that on the other side of
that door is the nuclear missile warp ship itself.

The ceiling has partially collapsed. Chunks of
concrete and fallen beams have destroyed some of the
equipment...Only a few of the consoles are active, most
are dark or fritzing sporadically. The lights are out,
and the room is illuminated by a few smoldering fires.
Four dead bodies can be seen strewn around the room.
It's a scene of destruction.

56   PICARD                                                      56

and his team ENTER the dark and smoking ruin. Beverly
and Picard move to one of the dead men, while Geordi
and the Security Guards move to the other three.
Beverly rolls the man onto his back -- he's clearly
dead. The name stitched on his uniform says Rippert.
Picard looks up.

PICARD
(to others)
See if any of these men are
Cochrane.

Geordi and the Guards start checking the dead bodies.

GEORDI
Mitchell... DePaul...

LANGE
This one's a woman... named Kirby.

Picard and Beverly move toward the immense blast door.
As Beverly scans it, Picard glances at a nearby desk...

57   THE DESK                                                    57

is littered with debris and various documents and
schematics. THREE PHOTOGRAPHS are pinned to a bulletin
board above the desk -- they show Zephram Cochrane and
two angles of his warp ship. The photos are odd-
looking, printed on what appears to be some sort of
cloth.

BEVERLY
There's a life sign behind this
door... about ten meters below.

Geordi moves to the door.

GEORDI
Blast door. It's designed to
protect the control room when the
missile is launched.

PICARD
There should be some kind of
manual release...

They hunt around for a moment. Geordi runs his hand
along the edge of the blast door. Picard turns to the
Guards.

PICARD
(to Lange)
Get those fires out and then try
to restore main power to the
control room.

LANGE
Aye, sir.

The Guards move off.

GEORDI
Got it, Captain.

Geordi has found an emergency BOX with several
pneumatic tubes and a hydraulic lever labeled
"emergency use only." He pulls down the lever, there
is a hissing sound, and the blast door slowly SLIDES
DOWN into the floor. We can now see the MISSILE SILO
itself beyond the door. Picard, Geordi and Beverly
step into...

58   INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTINUOUS                              58

Picard, Geordi and Beverly step onto the catwalk, which
surrounds the Silo walls. In the middle is the WARP
SHIP itself. It should look like an advanced ICBM
missile with a COCKPIT in place of the warhead, and
with numerous modifications to the fuselage. The
cockpit is on the same level as the control room. On
the side of the missile is the name "Phoenix". The
missile itself extends down another FOUR STORIES.
There are other catwalks below this one, with ladders
connecting the different levels. Beverly sees
something below.

BEVERLY
There.

59   NEW ANGLE                                                   59

Two catwalks below we can see a man sprawled on the
grating. They all scramble down the ladders past the
massive missile. (NOTE: Because of the design of the
Silo, we will see the entire missile only in a few
shots. For the most part, our view is limited to
sections of the missile.)

Beverly reaches the man, who is lying face-down on the
metal grating. She scans him...

BEVERLY
Severe radiation exposure...

Geordi looks over at the section of the missile on
their level. The side panels have been removed,
revealing complex circuitry within.

Picard joins Beverly, who turns over the injured man.
It's ZEPHRAM COCHRANE -- the man whose picture we saw
on the Borg monitors. Beverly begins pulling devices
out of her medkit, injects Cochrane with a hypospray.
Cochrane is a man in his mid-forties. He has a
youthful, dynamic appearance marred by recent radiation
burns.

PICARD
It's Cochrane.

BEVERLY
I've stabilized him for now... but
he's in a coma and he's going to
need radiometric therapy. I want
to take him to the ship.

Picard nods, reaches into his pants pocket, takes out
a combadge.

PICARD
Picard to Enterprise.
(no response)
Enterprise, please respond.

GEORDI
It could be the radiation,
Captain. Try from the surface.

Picard nods... then takes a deep breath, tries to
orient himself to the task at hand... there's a lot at
stake and a lot to do. He turns to Geordi.

PICARD
Mister La Forge, listen very
carefully. If you remember your
history... in less than twenty-
four hours, a Vulcan ship will be
passing through this system. When
it does, this ship needs to be in
space, flying at warp speed.

Geordi takes a deep breath, it's a tall order.

GEORDI
I'd better get started.

Geordi goes to work. Picard bends down and carefully
hoists Cochrane up into a fireman's carry. Beverly
follows him up the catwalk...

CUT TO:

60   EXT. MISSILE SILO - DAY                                     60

Minutes later. Cochrane is lying on the ground.
Beverly is kneeling beside him, unfolding a portable
stretcher from her medkit. Picard is checking two
combadges with a tricorder.

PICARD
It's not the radiation... and
there's nothing wrong with the
combadges... the Enterprise just
isn't responding.

BEVERLY
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical
attention, now.

PICARD
As I recall, the town of
Resurrection is about two
kilometers East of here. They
might have a hospital...

Picard looks troubled at the thought.

BEVERLY
What are we waiting for? Let's
go.

PICARD
It may not be that simple. This
is an extremely difficult and
paranoid time in human history.

BEVERLY
Are you saying they won't help us?

PICARD
I'm saying they might shoot us on
sight. You have to remember...
these people have watched their
entire way of life collapse around
them.

BEVERLY
There must be some good people...
even in this time.

PICARD
Let's hope so. Because if
Cochrane dies... the future may
die with him.

Picard kneels down and they begin to carefully put
Cochrane on the stretcher...

CUT TO:

61   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE                                    61

Riker, Troi and Worf studying a MONITOR which shows a
three-dimensional DIAGRAM of the Enterprise, which
turns and rotates as needed. The schematic shows
battle damage and repair efforts.

WORF
I have assigned two damage control
teams to locate the source of our
communication problems. So far,
they've had no success.

RIKER
Assign another team if you need
to. I want to re-establish
communication with the Captain as
soon as possible.

Worf nods and begins making notes on a PADD.

TROI
Are we in any danger of being
detected by Earth defense systems?

WORF
There were no planetary defense
systems in this era. Their
weapons were designed to
fight each other... not
extraterrestrials.

RIKER
We have to start thinking about a
way to get home.
(to Troi)
Analyze our readings from the
temporal vortex. We're going to
have to recreate whatever the Borg
did to --

Just then the ship SHUDDERS and the LIGHTS FLICKER.

RIKER
Report.

TROI
(off console)
We just lost main power... and
we've got Class-Three alerts all
over the ship. I'm not sure
what's --

An ALARM goes off on Worf's console. He reacts to it.

WORF
A ship-wide decompression has been
initiated!

RIKER
What?

TROI
We're venting our internal
atmosphere directly into space!

62   EXT. ENTERPRISE                                             62

CLOSE ON THE SAUCER as vents and hatches POP OPEN on
the hull and GIANT JETS OF VAPOR start blowing out
into space.

63   INT. CORRIDOR                                               63

Crewmembers walking along are suddenly KNOCKED to the
floor as hurricane force WINDS blow through the
Corridor. The ship is venting air into space, creating
a virtual VACUUM inside the ship! The people in the
corridor grab onto the bulkheads, struggling to hang on
against the force of the wind...

64   INT. BRIDGE                                                 64

Suddenly an emergency AIRLOCK on the Bridge OPENS.
VIOLENT WIND roars through the Bridge and everyone
hangs on. Troi is ripped out of her chair, flown
across the Bridge, slams up against the bulkhead,
struggling to hang on. Worf runs over, grabs her arm,
keeps her from flying out.

Riker manages to reach a control panel -- hits a button
and an EMERGENCY BULKHEAD finally slides down over the
airlock and the wind DIES DOWN. Everyone takes a beat.

RIKER
What the hell is happening, Worf?

WORF
(off console)
It appears that someone has taken
over the Environmental Control
Room.

TROI
Someone...?

RIKER
(realizing)
The Borg.  Some of them must've
beamed over before we destroyed
their ship.
(to Worf)
Seal off that entire deck with
emergency force fields.

TROI
Wil... Data was down there.

RIKER
(to Worf)
Mister Worf... find Data if you
can, but your top priority is
isolating the Borg.

WORF
Understood.

Worf heads for a Turbolift. OFF Riker's disturbed
expression...

CUT TO:

65   CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE                                        65

His eyes are closed. There's a beat, then his eyes fly
open and he looks around.

We PULL BACK slightly, revealing Data is lying on some
kind of tabletop with metallic clamps and restraints.
He tenses his arm and tries to move, but he is unable
to break the restraints. About two feet in front of
his face is what appears to be a bulkhead. There is a
cacophony of strange background NOISE -- scratching,
hisses, gurgling liquids, odd alien hums...

Suddenly, the table begins to MOVE. It ROTATES, and as
it does so we realize that Data has been hanging upside
down staring at the floor. It's a disorienting moment
as our perspective changes and Data rotates upright.

66   DATA'S POV                                                  66

As the table gyrates, we REVEAL the ROOM slowly. And
we realize we're in --

67   INT. BORG HIVE                                              67

The Environmental Control Room seen earlier has now
been transformed into the INNER-SANCTUM of the BORG.
The room has a dark, moist, organic feel -- a tropical
jungle of cybernetic equipment.

The Borg are altering the room, converting Starfleet
technology and materials into the living, bio-
mechanical look of the Borg. We see one Borg drone
attach a small pod to a Starfleet console and activate
it. The pod immediately sends out a COMPLEX WEB of
BORG TECHNOLOGY which covers the Starfleet console
inside and out. It's like weeds overpowering a flower
bed -- within seconds the console has been BORGIFIED.

The walls, ceiling and floor are now honeycombed with
the ALCOVES that make up the BORG COLLECTIVE. Borg
drones are motionless in their alcoves, cabling and
other conduits connecting them to various equipment...
while other Borg are moving about the room, carrying
out various modifications to the room. At one point,
we see Ensign Porter. He's been completely Borgified.
His skin pale, expression blank. No hint of humanity
left.

68   DATA                                                        68

still strapped to the table, which is twisting and
rotating, giving him frightening new glimpses of the
room. A new image appears -- SIX BORG DRONES are
clustered together in one section of the room, each
with an elaborate series of hoses and conduits
connected to its face.

Through the tubes we can see an exchange of FLUID and
ENERGY pulsing back and forth -- some sort of bizarre
"feeding" or "renewal" is going on. The tubes all seem
to lead toward the ceiling.

Data is now horizontal on his back and the table LOCKS
into position. A Borg drone OPENS A PANEL on the side
of Data's head, and begins connecting a thick bundle of
optical cabling to it.

DATA
(to Borg)
Your efforts to assimilate me will
be unsuccessful.

The Borg ignores him, activates a console... and the
cabling connected to Data's head LIGHTS UP with power.
They're trying to connect him to the Collective.

Data thinks for a moment, tilts his head slightly...
and then suddenly there's a SHOWER of SPARKS from the
cabling he's been connected to. The lights on the
cable go out. Data has thwarted their attempts.

DATA
(to Borg)
It would appear that resistance is
not always futile.

Suddenly a new VOICE is heard echoing through the room --
a woman's voice, low, seductive, deadly:

WOMAN'S VOICE
Brave words. I've heard them
before from thousands of species
across thousands of worlds...
since long before you were
created.

Data looks up toward...

69   THE CEILING                                                 69

A RUSTLE of MOVEMNET somewhere in the cyber-tangle...
almost like a snake slithering beneath the weeds. And
for a brief instant we get a glimpse of a FACE unlike
any Borg we've ever seen. The face of a woman. Pale-
skinned... piercing eyes...raven hair slicked back...
a hauntingly beautiful image in a sea of nightmarish
technology. And then it's gone.

70   DATA                                                        70

Frowns. He saw it, too, but he's not sure what to make
of it.

WOMAN'S VOICE
But now... they are all one with
the Borg.

DATA
I am unlike any lifeform you have
encountered before. As an
android, I am in complete control
of my neural net. The information
contained there cannot be forcibly
removed.

WOMAN'S VOICE
You are an imperfect being...
created by an imperfect being.
Finding your weakness is only a
matter of time.

Suddenly three Borg drones converge on Data with
various wicked-looking Borg devices. One of the Borg
has a specialized cybernetic ARM, which EXTRUDES a
series of stiletto-tipped DRILL SPIKES. As the six-
inch spikes begin to BORE INTO Data's head...

CUT TO:

71   EXT. MONTANA - RESURRECTION CITY - DAY                      71

Resurrection is a small town -- around 1,000 people --
a rural, Western community that's probably existed for
at least two hundred years, and we can see the roots of
the original ranching community in some of the
architecture. But it's also a community of the 21st
century.

The most striking feature of the town is that it sits
in the middle of nearly a hundred WIND MILLS, which
provide the only source of power for the town. The
blades are enormous, but the structures supporting them
are little more than simple poles. Some are sleek,
fiberglass, futuristic... others have a more cobbled
together, make-shift appearance. At the moment, only
a few blades are turning in the gentle breeze.

Picard and Beverly emerge from the nearby woods
carrying the stretcher. They exchange a look at the
sight of the city and then head toward it...

72   EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - DAY                                72

A few minutes later. Picard and Beverly carrying
Cochrane down the street toward the hospital at the
end. As they walk along, we get our first taste of
post-apocalyptic 21st century life:

This is a recognizable American community, but it's
definitely a futuristic town. Clothing, architecture,
technology -- all have changed over the course of
seventy years. But it is a broken future. What used
to be high-tech public COMPUTER TERMINALS are rusted
and abandoned. We can see the corroded hulks of HOVER-
CARS lying idle in the streets. Futuristic elements
now useless.

At one point, they pass a large polyurethane TENT --
the inside surface is covered with condensation and we
can see the silhouettes of people moving within. The
entrance is guarded by a single Militia Guard. Later
we will learn that this is a primitive greenhouse, the
only place where they can grow uncontaminated food.

What used to be a McDonald's, or some other
recognizable food chain, has now been gutted and has
been turned into a kind of blacksmith shop. People are
fashioning metal into various tools using hammer and
tongs.

The sidewalks are populated with PEOPLE, who congregate
in small groups, quietly talking amongst themselves,
others just staring vacantly off into space. Many of
them have visible burn scars and damage to their bodies --
victims of the war and post-nuclear environmental
dangers. A few of them are applying a special lotion
to their arms and face -- protection against the toxic
elements. A long FOOD LINE snakes around a block, as
people line up to get their daily rations.

A few people glance up at Picard and Beverly with
curious or suspicious looks. This is not a community
that welcomes strangers. At one point, they see a man
dressed in futuristic CAMOUFLAGE carrying an automatic
weapon -- we will learn he's a MILITIA SOLDIER. He
stares at them with a neutral expression, then walks
off.

The people here have that hollow-eyed, listless look
about them. They're going through something that makes
the Great Depression look like a minor inconvenience.
But there's also a toughness to these people, a
resilience and determination to survive in the face of
overwhelming odds. We are looking at our future... and
it's on the verge of collapse.

CUT TO:

73   INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY                        73

A short time later. Cochrane is being lifted onto an
operating table. Picard and Beverly step back from the
table as a DOCTOR and two NURSES look him over. The
doctor is in his early fifties and has a weathered,
tired look to him. The hospital itself is like the
rest of the town -- a futuristic setting fallen on hard
times. The light in the room is provided mostly from
the sunlight streaming in through the windows. Light
bulbs and other gear flicker dimly around the hospital --
we get the feeling they have very little power.

DOCTOR
How long has he been unconscious?

BEVERLY
At least four hours.

He checks Cochran's head injury as Beverly takes out
her tricorder and scans him.

DOCTOR
It looks like he has a cranial
fracture, but I'll need X-rays to
be sure.
(to Nurse)
Get Ruby in here.

One of the nurses runs off.

BEVERLY
(off tricorder)
He has a severe fracture of the
left occipital plate. He's not
hemorrhaging... but the radiation
has damaged his KNA and his APR
cell count...

He looks at her curiously.

DOCTOR
"APR cell count?" What the hell
are you talking about?

PICARD
(quickly)
Doctor Crusher has been...
studying some advanced medical
theories.

NURSE
(re: tricorder)
What is that?

BEVERLY
It's a... new medical scanner.
It's a little more precise than an
X-ray machine.

The Doctor eyes it.

DOCTOR
Is it Japanese?

BEVERLY
Um... yeah.
(beat)
Now he's going to need a
respirator. Do you have one?

DOCTOR
We have two... but we don't have
the juice to run them.

PICARD
Juice?

DOCTOR
Power. There hasn't been a lot of
wind through here for the last
couple of weeks. Most of the
batteries are depleted.

BEVERLY
Don't you have any generators, or
other fuel sources?

The Doctor throws her an irritated look.

DOCTOR
Maybe you'd like to take your
patient to the hospital in
Bozemen... it's only two hundred
miles away.

Cochrane wheezes -- breathing becoming labored and
ragged. Beverly scans him, urgent.

BEVERLY
His automatic reflexes are
fluctuating. We've got to get him
on a respirator.

DOCTOR
(to Nurse)
Bag him.

The nurse picks up a portable respirator sack -- puts
it on Cochrane's face and squeezes the bag, forcing air
into Cochrane's lungs. Picard has been thinking
through this scene, finally has a solution.

PICARD
Beverly -- your tricorder.

She hands him her tricorder.

PICARD
(to Doctor)
Where's the battery room for the
hospital?

DOCTOR
I told you, there's no --

PICARD
Where?

DOCTOR
Outside, around back. Next to the
water tank.

Picard rushes out the doors. Beverly checks Cochrane's
pulse.

BEVERLY
His heartbeat's irregular...

Beverly climbs up on top of Cochrane, straddling him,
begins giving him 24th century CPR. She takes charge.

BEVERLY
Adrenaline -- ten CC's!

As they rush to save him.

74   EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                         74

The back of the building. Picard rushes out and spots
an old, dilapidated BATTERY UNIT providing power to the
hospital. He quickly yanks off the back panel,
revealing a tangle of wires, and several large
batteries. He kneels down, then removes the back of
the tricorder.

75   CLOSE ON TRICORDER                                          75

as Picard pulls out a small POWER CELL -- about half
the size of a dime. The blinkies on the tricorder go
out.

76   PICARD                                                      76

holds the power cell with one hand, and starts pulling
out wires from the batteries with the other.

77   INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY                        77

As before. Beverly, the doctor and the nurse trying to
save Cochrane.

BEVERLY
(pumping his chest)
One... two... three... compress!

The nurse squeezes the bag. Suddenly the room is
filled with the HUM of POWER and ALL OF THE LIGHTS AND
EQUIPMENT COME TO LIFE. Monitors blinking, fluorescent
lights flashing on. Everyone reacts with shock.

78   INT. HOSPITAL WARD - DAY                                    78

It's filled with patients. The lights and equipment
here FLASH ON, as well. Doctors and patients alike
react with surprise.

79   INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY                        79

Picard enters. They've placed a RESPIRATOR down
Cochrane's throat, and attached electrodes to his
chest. Beverly has just finished giving him an
injection with a hypospray. The heart monitor in the
background is now beating regularly. The doctor turns
to Picard.

DOCTOR
What did you do to the batteries?

PICARD
Oh... just a little tinkering.
How is he?

BEVERLY
He's stable... for now.
(with meaning)
But it would be better if we could
contact... our friends.

PICARD
Yes. But until then, you'll have
to make do with what you've got.

BEVERLY
That'll be interesting.

A WOMAN'S VOICE:

RUBY'S VOICE
What happened to him?

Everyone turns.

80   NEW ANGLE                                                   80

revealing RUBY SLOANE standing at the front of
Cochrane's bed. A striking woman in her mid-to-late
thirties -- dark hair, tall, lean, beautiful under
normal circumstances but at the moment she's not at her
best, it looks like she's just come in from a hard
day's work. She's wearing an old lab coat. But the
most striking quality of all is the innate intelligence
we can see in her eyes.

She's looking directly at Picard for an answer. Picard
realizes he has to say something. He looks into her
eyes and there is a moment here -- a brief spark of
chemistry that in normal circumstances the Captain just
might follow up. But at the moment, he shoves that
electric feeling aside and tries to give her an answer.

PICARD
There was some kind of explosion
out at the missile silo...

She looks at him for a moment, her eyes boring into him
without expression, as though probing the truthfulness
of his statement.

DOCTOR
Ruby, we're going to need a series
of cranial X-rays tonight.

RUBY
(nods)
I have a fresh set of plates at
home. I'll have them here by
eight.

She turns back to Cochrane, moves to his side, gently
takes his hand and looks at him with sad affection.

RUBY
(quiet)
Take care of him. He's a very
special man.

PICARD
Yes, he is.

She looks up at Picard, and again there's a slight
feeling of chemistry in the air. And then she turns
and starts to walk out of the room. Picard's combadge
BEEPS. Reactions.

GEORDI'S COM VOICE
La Forge to Picard.

RUBY
(stopping)
I think there's someone in your
pants.

PICARD
Excuse me. I have a... telephone
call.

Picard takes a few steps away, pulls the combadge out
of his pants pocket, taps it. Ruby watches him a beat,
then walks out of the room.

PICARD
Picard here.

GEORDI'S COM VOICE
Captain, we have a problem. I
think you'd better get back here.

PICARD
I'm on my way. Picard out.

Picard moves to Beverly.

PICARD
(sotto)
I have to go back to the silo.
Will you be all right?

BEVERLY
I'll be fine.
(re: Cochrane)
He's a different story.

Beverly begins examining the medical equipment she'll
have to work with as Picard exits...

81   EXT. RESURRECTION CITY STREET - DAY                         81

A short time later. Picard walking down the main
street back toward the gates. People passing him,
taking no notice of him...Picard's mind thinking
ahead. He happens to glance down a side street, then
he stops.

82   NEW ANGLE                                                   82

Looking down the side street. Ruby, the mysterious
woman from the hospital, is walking along with a camera
bag now slung over her shoulder. She stops for a
moment as she passes the hulk of a burnt-out old hover
car... stares at it...then pulls a home-made
FUTURISTIC CAMERA out of her bag and snaps a picture of
the car. She continues on her way. Picard is
intrigued -- wonders about this woman and what it is
she could be taking a picture of. Just then --

MAN'S VOICE
Catch.

Picard turns just in time to catch a small, metal
canister with a screw-top.

The man who threw it steps into view. It's LIEUTENANT
SCRIMM. Scrimm is the head of the town's militia.
While not a physically threatening man, there is a
quietly disturbing quality about him which conveys an
intelligence laced with a tightly reined volatility.
He's wearing futuristic combat fatigues and always
carries a sidearm. Before the war, Scrimm was probably
one of the "survivalists" who used to be dismissed as
radicals until their predictions of Armageddon came
true. At the moment, Scrimm is presenting his
friendliest face to Picard.

SCRIMM
(pleasant)
Think you'll need that.

Picard eyes the canister, not sure what to make of it.

SCRIMM
It's no zone solution.
(off his look)
You know. "No ozone."

He points to the sky.

PICARD
Oh...  yes... ultraviolet
protection. Thank you.
Mister...?

SCRIMM
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant
Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of
the Resurrection Protective Force.
(beat)
And you are?

PICARD
Jean-Luc Picard.

SCRIMM
Great name. French?

PICARD
Yes.

SCRIMM
You don't sound French.

Scrimm is still smiling at him, but his eyes never
leave Picard.

PICARD
I was raised in England and here
in the States. Thank you for
the... no zone.

Picard begins to walk away, not wanting to engage any
citizens of the town. Scrimm falls in next to him.

SCRIMM
Where in the States?

PICARD
Oh... here and there. You know
how it is.

SCRIMM
Not really. I was born and raised
right here. Never had much use
for travel.

He casually steps in front of Picard, blocking his way.

SCRIMM
Where are you from most recently?

PICARD
(thinking fast)
California. San Francisco.

SCRIMM
Beautiful city. Used to be,
anyway. I didn't think anyone
still lived there.

PICARD
There's a few of us left.

Picard steps around him and continues walking down the
street. Scrimm waits a beat, then walks after him
again.

SCRIMM
That was a pretty clever trick you
did with the hospital's batteries.
How'd you do it?

PICARD
It wasn't a trick. I used to be
an electrical engineer.

SCRIMM
Huh.

He steps in front of Picard again, still pleasant but
a little bit of a smile fading from his face. Picard
realizes he isn't going to shake this man so easily.

SCRIMM
And what were you doing out at the
missile silo?

PICARD
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's...
I wanted to see how he was doing.

SCRIMM
Lucky for him you came by when you
did. He might be dead now.

PICARD
Yes.

SCRIMM
Maybe you can tell me what he's
been doing in that silo. We heard
some explosions out there this
morning...

PICARD
I think he was running a test on
an old rocket engine... and one of
the fuel cells burst.

Scrimm eyes him evenly.

SCRIMM
You seem to have an answer for
everything.

PICARD
Something wrong with that?

SCRIMM
Not yet.

A tense beat. Then Scrimm smiles easily.

SCRIMM
(re: balm)
Be sure you put that on. You need
a lot of protection around here.

He holds Picard's eyes for a moment.

PICARD
Thank you. But I've never had
much trouble protecting myself.

Now it's Picard's turn to smile pleasantly at Scrimm.
Picard walks around him and heads for the gates.
Scrimm watches him go with a thoughtful expression --
clearly, he's more than a little suspicious...

CUT TO:

83   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE                                 83

in orbit of Earth.

84   INT. CORRIDOR                                               84

Worf and a large SECURITY DETACHMENT -- a dozen or so
men and women -- are moving down the Corridor with grim
looks on their faces. They are carrying new powerful-
looking phaser rifles and other equipment. The feeling
is of an elite combat squad heading for a dangerous
mission. They stop at one point and Worf lifts up a
DECKPLATE, exposing a large HATCH in the floor. Worf
hits his combadge.

WORF
Worf to Bridge. We're in
position.

85   INT. BRIDGE                                                 85

Riker in command, Troi nearby. Riker is standing at
the security station looking at a monitor which
displays a schematic graphic of the ship. The position
of the security team is flashing -- we can see they are
on Deck 46.

RIKER
This is the Bridge. I'm releasing
the emergency force fields.

He nods to Troi, who works a console.

86   INT. CORRIDOR                                                86

Worf and his team watch as the FORCEFIELD protecting
the hatch flashes off. Worf reaches down and releases
the hatch, which slides open with a soft whoosh. He
glances at his men for a moment, then JUMPS down the
hatch...

87   INT. DECK 47 - CORRIDOR                                     87

As Worf lands on his feet. The light is dim, no power
on this deck, hard to see. He looks around warily for
a moment, phaser at-the-ready, then activates his wrist
beacon. We immediately notice that we can see Worf's
breath -- it's freezing cold down here. He shines the
light around the darkened corridor, then silently
motions his arm for the others to follow. A beat, then
we see the security officers start to drop into the
corridor from the hatch above...

88   NEW ANGLE - CORRIDOR                                        88

As Worf's squad spreads out along the hall, weapons at-
the-ready, everyone alert with fingers on the triggers.
We see that the phaser rifles are equipped with their
own light sources, intended to illuminate the target
before you shoot at it. The Security Officers are
constantly moving their lights back and forth through
the chilly air. Worf gives hand signals -- holds up
two fingers, then a fist, and points forward.

Two Guards trot down the corridor about fifteen feet,
stop, and take up firing positions... then two more
members of the team run down, leap frog ahead of them
and take positions further down the corridor. Classic
military deployment. Worf starts scanning with a
tricorder.

WORF
(hits combadge)
Worf to Bridge.

RIKER'S COM VOICE
Riker here.

WORF
There's a dampening field in place
on this deck. Our tricorders are
useless.

The team continue to explore Deck 47. It's spooky,
eerie, a sense of menace around every corner. They
open doors, check room by room, section by section,
still no sign of the Borg in the freezing cold
darkness.

90   ANGLE ON SECURITY GUARD                                     90

The Corridor directly ahead has been stripped of wall,
ceiling and deck panels -- all the normal decorative
Enterprise sheathing is gone, revealing the circuitry
and machinery of the ship itself. Unlike the rest of
the corridors, there does appear to be POWER flowing
through some of the conduits up ahead, and it gives off
an eerie glow.

We can also see that some of the machinery has been
altered and changed -- not just the neat and orderly
arrangement you'd expect to find behind bulkheads --
there's a sense of cross-circuitry, re-wiring,
equipment being rearranged. Clearly, a lot of work has
gone on in this area of the ship. Worf steps forward,
examines the corridor closely.

ENSIGN HAWK
What the hell is going on?

WORF
Borg...

Worf signals the team forward, and they slowly begin
picking their way down the Borgified Corridor. It's
not easy -- they have to choose their footing carefully
as they walk through the maze of cables, circuits, and
machinery... Ensign Hawk accidentally steps on some
circuitry, which gives off a BEEP. The entire team
suddenly whirls their lights and weapons on the
unfortunate Ensign, who pales at their sudden attention.

Worf looks irritated, then motions his team to continue
their search. They continue making their way down the
spooky corridor... and as they turn a corner...

92   NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER CORRIDOR                                92

where the machinery is now THICKER and more BORG-LIKE
in appearance. Tubes and cabling hang down from the
ceiling. If anything, it's even colder in here. The
deeper they go, the worse it gets. We can now hear a
low, sinister HUM of alien power. At the end of this
corridor is the ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL ROOM, as seen
earlier. The entire doorway is gone -- and a weird
pulsing GLOW fills the room. Worf stops his team at
the sight. From this vantage, we cannot see directly
into the room, but clearly something is going on in
there.

Worf signals his men to spread out, and they take up
positions around the Corridor, all weapons trained on
Environmental Control.

WORF
Worf to Bridge. We're about to
enter the Environmental Control
Room.

RIKER'S COM VOICE
Any sign of Data, or the Borg
themselves?

As Work and Riker continue talking, we MOVE TO Ensign
Hawk, who is now the last man in the formation,
covering the rear. He's shining his phaser-beacon into
the empty darkness. He can't help looking back over
his shoulder at the rest of the team and the distant
Environmental Control Room -- that seems to be where
the action is. As he turns, his beacon moves with him,
throwing the Corridor behind them in and out of
darkness.

WORF
(continuing)
Negative. However, they've
reconfigured the ODN network...
and re-routed all power on this
deck into Environmental Control.

As Worf speaks, Ensign Hawk turns back, but this time
when he shines his beacon into the darkness, something
MOVES in the distance -- a shadow. The Ensign freezes,
brings his rifle up. But did he see it, or was it his
imagination?

A tense beat as he waits, heart pounding... but nothing
happens. On the wall next to his head we see what can
only be described as a BIO-MECHANISTIC CABLE creeping
out of the wall... which begins slowly heading for the
Ensign's neck. Just as he begins to sense that
something is happening behind him, the cable WHIPS OUT
around his neck and YANKS him deep into the bed of
circuitry in the blink of an eye -- the motion so fast
we have trouble following it.

Worf turns his head at the sound.

WORF
Stand by, Commander
(to team)
Where's Ensign Hawk?

Everyone looks around, surprised that he's not there.
Everyone is alert, keyed up. The tension is thick.
Utter silence, except for the hum of the machinery and
the frosty breathing of the team.

RIKER'S COM VOICE
Worf? Is something wrong?

WORF
Something is very wrong,
Commander. We're falling back.

Worf gives hand signals for the team to move out. But
just as they start to fall back, everything happens at
once.

93   BORG DRONES                                                 93

EXPLODE OUT OF THE WALLS, CEILING AND FLOOR! What
follows is a BLUR of action happening so fast and
furious we never get a true sense of what's happening.

A flurry of violence and motion and images:

-- A snarling Borg face -- half-human, half-machine, a
cybernetic nightmare.

-- Strange, bio-mechanical WEAPONS extruding from Borg
bodies, RIPPING into human flesh.

-- A crewmember PULLED into a bed of machinery.

WORF
Fire at will!

But the Borg are already on top of them. It's a brutal
fight in close quarters with no escape.

Phasers and Borg lasers lighting up the corridor,
bodies flying through the air... utter chaos and
terror. The fight goes hand to hand and Worf sees that
they don't have a chance...

WORF
(throwing off a Borg)
Fall back!

The team starts backpedaling, FIRING as they go...but
the Borg are unstoppable now -- they put up personal
force fields to protect themselves.

WORF
Go, go, GO!

Worf pushes his men down the corridor. Everyone turns
and RUNS like hell. Worf bends down and grabs a
frightened Lieutenant by the collar, pulling him along.

94   VARIOUS SHOTS:                                              94

-- The team running through the corridors, SHOOTING
behind them at the pursuing Borg, to no effect...

-- Two of the Borg raise their arms and FIRE LASER
BURSTS out of their arms and wrists, taking DOWN two
Security Guards. Worf sees them fall but there's no
time to go back.

95   INT. DECK 46 - CORRIDOR                                     95

As Worf's team starts CLIMBING UP and out the dark
hatch in the floor seen earlier.

96   INT. DECK 47 - CORRIDOR                                     96

As the last member of Worf's team climbs out to safety.
The Borg swarm is about to overpower Worf. He quickly
hits a few controls on his phaser, sets it to overload.
We hear the building WHINE. He JUMPS straight up into
the air, GRABBING onto the hatch rim, pulling himself
up. He barely manages to vanish from view just as the
phaser EXPLODES in a FIERY BLAST, taking out several of
the Borg drones.

97   INT. DECK 46 - CORRIDOR                                      97

The conclusive BLAST comes up through the hatch,
causing Worf to duck for a moment.

Worf reaches out to close the hatch, when a BORG HAND
bursts up from below and GRABS his forearm. It's a
test of strength. Worf reaches over with his other
arm, hits a control and the hatch SLIDES CLOSED,
SEVERING the Borg arm in a shower of sparks.

WORF
Worf to Bridge -- force fields!

The force field FLASHES into place. Worf and his team
sit there a moment, catching their breath, stunned at
what they've just been through.

RIKER'S COM VOICE
What the hell happened down there,
Worf?

WORF
Commander... we have a problem.

OFF Worf's shaken expression...

CUT TO:

98   INT. MISSILE SILO - CATWALK - DAY                           98

Geordi and Picard are walking down the catwalk ladders
toward the missile's massive engines. Now that the
smoke has cleared and the place has been cleared up a
bit, we get our first good look at the ship and the
damage done in the Borg attack.

GEORDI
(on the move)
Cochrane was going to use this
solid rocket booster to lift the
ship into orbit. Before the warp
drive took over... everything
would depend on these old chemical
engines.
(beat)
Now here's the problem...

They arrive at a point on the fuselage where we can see
a large section of the engines have been BLASTED AWAY,
leaving a deep, ugly SCAR -- broken conduit lines,
wires that now lead to nothing. It's clear that a key
piece of equipment has been destroyed.

GEORDI
(re: damage)
This used to be the throttle valve
assembly.
(observing it)
It controls the thrust of the
engines. It's been completely
vaporized... and without it,
there's no way to launch the ship.

PICARD
Can you reconstruct the throttle
valve?

GEORDI
Yeah... if I knew what it looked
like. There's probably five
hundred ways to design a valve
like this...

PICARD
We need to launch this ship in
under eighteen hours...
(beat)
There must be some design
schematics... blueprints...

GEORDI
We're tearing this place apart
looking for them... but the
computers are down, and the fires
destroyed half the files...so
far, nothing.

They look at the damage in frustration.

GEORDI
If it was just part of the warp
drive, I'd know what to do. But
this... it's like trying to
rebuild Orville Wright's airplane
with canvass and sticks.

Picard thinks, remembers something.

PICARD
Wait a minute...

99   INT. CONTROL ROOM                                           99

Moments later. Picard and Geordi are looking at the
three cloth-printed photographs seen earlier -- the
headshot of Cochrane and two different angles of the
three cloth-printed photographs seen earlier -- the
warp ship with people working on it. Picard spreads
them out on the desk.

GEORDI
Yeah, I looked at these already.

Geordi points to a photo of the ship -- a worker is
walking in front of the throttle assembly, blocking
most of it from view.

GEORDI
You can almost see the throttle
assembly in this one... but this
guy walked in front of it when
they took the picture.

Picard considers, absently sticks his hand in his
jacket pocket. He pulls out the canister of balm
Scrimm gave him and tosses it onto the table.

PICARD
Could you reconstruct the throttle
from a photograph like this... if
that man wasn't blocking the view?

Geordi thinks it over.

GEORDI
Maybe...
(beat)
Sure. Yeah. As long as I could
get a clear look at the intake
configuration. But so far, we
haven't found any other photos.

PICARD
(staring at photos)
If there are other photographs...
I think I may know how to find
them.

CUT TO:

100   INT. BORG HIVE                                             100

It's a while later, and the Borg are making progress.
Data is strapped to the table, PANELS open on his HEAD
and CHEST. Three Borg drones are working methodically
on his inner-circuitry. The jagged voice of the woman
cuts in:

WOMAN'S VOICE
Your resistance is... illogical.
To us, your neural net is simply
another piece of technology. We
will learn its secrets.

Data stares at the murky ceiling.

DATA
Who are you?

WOMAN'S VOICE
I am the Borg.

DATA
That is a contradiction. The Borg
act as a collective consciousness.
There are no individuals.

WOMAN'S VOICE
I am the beginning... the end. I
am the one who is many. I am the
Borg.

Out of the mist that hugs the top of the room DESCENDS
the BORG QUEEN.

She is unlike any of the Borg drones we've ever seen --
a humanoid female with conduits and tubes running out
of her body. She has no legs. Her torso is SUSPENDED
by a complex rig of CABLES and HYDRAULICS. Her face
and upper-torso are much more humanoid, with the pasty-
pale white of Borg flesh. Her EYES have a silvery
glint to them. Her demeanor is seductive and sensual
in contrast to the harsh, mechanical surroundings. She
is an eerie blend of two worlds -- organic and
mechanical.

With the soft HISS of hydraulics, she LOWERS herself
down to where her face is very close to that of Data's.
Her features are almost angelic, but the silvery glint
in her eyes betrays an inner-darkness.

DATA
You are the guiding intelligence
behind the Borg...?

BORG QUEEN
Intelligence... ambition...
desire... I bring order to
chaos...

She studies his face with a certain child-like quality.

BORG QUEEN
It's unfortunate we will have to
destroy you to obtain the
information we need. You are a...
unique lifeform.
(beat)
Synthetic... and yet far more than
a simple automaton.
You have no idea how close to
perfection you are.

She stares at him intently, and we get the hint that
her interest in Data may go beyond simple assimilation.
She seems fascinated by him. Data picks up on this.

DATA
How do you define perfection?

The Queen opens her arms slightly, clearly indicating
herself.

BORG QUEEN
A blending of the organic and the
synthetic. The highest form of
life in the galaxy.

Data eyes her, considering.

DATA
An interesting definition. But it
is not one that applies to me. I
am completely artificial. I have
no organic components.

She looks at him as a new thought crosses her mind.
She might've just found the chink in Data's armor.

BORG QUEEN
Have you ever wondered what it's
like to have flesh?

DATA
It is impossible to imagine
sensations for which I have no
frame of reference.

She smiles.

BORG QUEEN
That... can change.

The Queen looks to the three Borg drones and gives them
a silent command. The drones immediately stop working
on Data's open panels... and shift their attention to
his right ARM. One of the drones tears off the sleeve
on Data's uniform, exposing his bare arm. Another then
uses a small cutting device to SLICE OFF the synthetic
skin from Data's arm. As Data prepares himself for the
worst...

101   INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR                                   101

THREE armored SECURITY GUARDS with phaser rifles run
into view, hit a control panel on the wall. A giant
EMERGENCY BULKHEAD comes SLAMMING down, cutting off the
rest of the corridor.

The security guards turn to run down the hall, but then
there is a high-pitched shriek of wrenching metal.
They drop to the deck and take combat stances.

GUARD  1
Set phasers to rotating
modulation!

They make adjustments to their weapons just as the
bulkhead doors EXPLODE INWARD in a blinding flash. The
guards shield themselves against the fire and debris...
looks up just in time to see the swift and lethal
shapes of the BORG jumping through the smashed
bulkhead, racing down the corridor toward them. The
guards FIRE, and when they do the PHASER BLASTS
alternate color -- red, blue, green, purple, orange --
a staccato of colors as the phasers shift frequency.

The phaser blasts TAKE DOWN a few of the BORG... but
then we see the distinctive PERSONAL FORCEFIELDS of the
other Borg begin to compensate, and the phasers no
longer affect them.

GUARD  1
That's it, they've adjusted --
fall back!

They turn to run but BORG PHASER FIRE lances out from
the Borg soldiers and RIPS them apart.

CUT TO:

102   INT. BRIDGE                                                102

The mood is tense, grim. Riker, Worf and Troi are
gathered around a SCHEMATIC of the ENTERPRISE. The
lower portion of the ship has been blocked off by
the color RED, representing the Borg advance through
the ship. A they watch, another section of
compartments and corridors suddenly turn RED.

Riker lets out a wary breath, starts pointing to
various points along the schematic.

RIKER
All right... we've lost control of
eight decks... three Cargo Bays...
one Shuttlebay.

TROI
Do we have any idea how many Borg
we're dealing with?

WORF
We saw at least thirty...and
there are twenty-two Enterprise
crewmembers reported missing...
including Commander Data.

RIKER
We'll have to assume they've been
assimilated into the Collective.

TROI
Even Data?

WORF
Data's positronic net contains
classified information on the
Enterprise. Command codes,
security protocols...

RIKER
If they control Data, they control
the ship.

A grim beat.

RIKER
We can't worry about that right
now. Let's concentrate on what we
can.

They stare at the schematic.

WORF
To control the Enterprise, they'll
have to gain access to one of two
locations. Main Engineering... or
the Bridge.

RIKER
We have to cover both
possibilities.
(to Troi)
We'll take care of the Bridge.
Worf, take your men and seal off
Main Engineering. Turn it into a
fortress -- nothing gets in.

Worf nods and EXITS. As Riker and Troi exchange a
tense look...

CUT TO:

103   EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - HOSPITAL - NIGHT                  103

The hospital is completely LIT UP -- the only building
in town with this much power.

104   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT                             104

Picard walks down the hall, stops outside a door marked
"X-RAY PROCESSING." The RED LIGHT is on above the
door, but that means nothing to Picard... who opens the
door and steps inside...

105   INT. X-RAY PROCESSING ROOM                                 105

Much like a traditional darkroom, trays of chemicals
and washes, etc. But everything has a slightly
futuristic and cobbled-together feel. They are
developing X-rays by hand instead of by machine. The
room is lit with an AMBER glow. As soon as Picard
opens the door, we hear Ruby's voice:

RUBY'S VOICE
Shut that door!

Picard quickly shuts the door behind him, looks around
the room. Ruby, who's working at a tray of chemicals,
turns around in fury.

RUBY
What are you, an idiot? Didn't
you see the red light was on?

PICARD
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize
that --

RUBY
Thank God this plate was already
fixed.

She pulls down a small pane of glass (probably from a
window) out of a tub of water... holds it up to the
light. And there on the glass is a X-RAY of a man's
SKULL. Picard moves to her.

PICARD
(re: X-ray)
Cochrane?

RUBY
Yes... and I only had enough
silver halide for one shot. So
you're lucky you didn't screw it
up.

PICARD
I'm very sorry.

She glances at him, sees he feels genuinely bad. She
softens a little.

RUBY
Don't worry about it.

She picks up a rubber squeegee and carefully starts to
dry off the pane of glass.

RUBY
Did you need something?

PICARD
Yes... I wanted to ask you about
some photographs I saw out at the
silo. There were three of them...
printed on some kind of fabric.

RUBY
Bed sheets.
(off his look)
I used my last set of bed sheets to
make those prints. Not the best
material, but I haven't seen a
clean piece of paper in five
years.

PICARD
Did you take any other pictures of
the rocket?

The X-ray is now dry, and Ruby turns and looks at him.

RUBY
Sure.
(jokingly)
Why, did you want to buy them?

Picard doesn't realize she was kidding -- jumps on the
opportunity to get the photos.

PICARD
Yes. I don't have any money right
now, but I may be able to get
some.

Ruby looks at him for a moment -- is he serious? She
gives him a curious smile.

RUBY
"Money." So you can get dome
money...

PICARD
I can try.

RUBY
You'd have to try real hard. No
one's used currency in over ten
years. What are you, from another
planet?

Picard hesitates, smiles at her, tries to laugh it off.

PICARD
No... but sometimes I feel that
way.
(beat)
What I meant was, I'd be willing
to trade for the photographs.

RUBY
Trade. Okay. The photographs...
for a straight answer.
(beat)
Who are you? And how do you know
Zephram?

PICARD
I'm an old friend... I met him
when he was doing his
undergraduate work at Cornell back
in --

RUBY
(cuts him off)
'Fraid not.

Ruby walks past him with the X-ray...

106   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                        106

Picard follows Ruby out into the corridor. She has a
satisfied smile on her face -- it's not easy to put one
over on this woman. And the truth is, she's enjoying
Picard's frustration. As they walk along...

PICARD
What?

RUBY
(casual)
You're lying.

PICARD
What makes you say that?

RUBY
You're not someone who lies very
easily... so it's obvious when you
do... at least to me.

PICARD
Are you always sucha good judge
of character?

She stops, turns, looks at him.

RUBY
Always.

Ruby turns and walks off. Picard follows her, doggedly
determined to get those photos...

107   INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT                     107

Beverly is holding the X-ray glass Ruby made up to the
light, as the Doctor seen earlier looks on.

BEVERLY
The occipital fracture is
widening... we're going to have
to fuse the bones...

DOCTOR
I'm a little worried about some of
these bone fragments. If they
move any closer to the brain, we
could be looking at a hemorrhage.

As Beverly and the Doctor examine the X-ray, we MOVE TO
Ruby, who's looking down at Cochrane. He's still in
bed and on a respirator. She smoothes his hair with
affection. Picard stands on the other side of the bed,
watching her.

PICARD
Were the two of you... involved?

RUBY
No... not like you and Doctor
Crusher used to be.

PICARD
(surprised)
How did you know about that?

Ruby looks at him with a smile.

RUBY
I didn't.

Her smile widens, and then she leaves the bed to join
the Doctor and Beverly. Picard shakes his head and
smiles after her -- chagrinned and amused at the same
time.

RUBY
(to Doctor)
We can't take any more X-rays
until I can mix up a new batch of
the silver halide.

DOCTOR
Can you do it tonight? We may
have to operate.

RUBY
Sure. It'll be ready by morning.

Ruby turns and heads for the door. Picard moves after
her.

PICARD
Ruby... I need to talk to you
about those photographs. It's
very important.

RUBY
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to
wait until tomorrow.

PICARD
It can't wait until tomorrow...

RUBY
Too bad.
(beat)
Besides, it'll give you all night
to think up a new set of lies.

She flashes him that smile again, then darts out the
door. Picard is left frustrated -- he knows that he
can't let it go at that...

CUT TO:

108   INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING                              108

Worf and a team of TEN SECURITY GUARDS are preparing
for battle. They're setting up large, heavy-duty
phaser equivalents of machine guns --  big, mean-looking
weapons on tripods. There are two of these weapons
aimed at each entrance to Engineering. The Security
Officers are strapping on body armor, checking weapons,
building makeshift barricades over each of the doors.

Worf is in command, directing the action.

WORF
(to team)
Double check each assault
phaser... make certain that the
range setting is no more than
thirty meters. We don't want to
blast through the hull.

Worf turns and picks up his BAT'LETH SWORD off a nearby
console. He checks the sharpness of the blade.

SECURITY OFFICER
Are you sure you don't want
something a little more...
sophisticated, sir?

WORF
Mind your post, Lieutenant.

The Lieutenant decides not to pursue the matter and
moves off. Worf makes a quick practiced motion with
the sword... decides he's ready.

109   INT. BRIDGE                                                109

Riker and Troi watching the schematic.

Riker works a control and the display ZOOMS IN to
display a cutaway view of the ship highlighting
Engineering and the surrounding deck. A SWARM of DOTS
representing the Borg is advancing on Engineering.

RIKER
(to com)
Riker to Engineering. Mister
Worf...the Borg are approaching
your position.

WORF'S COM VOICE
Understood. We're ready.

Riker and Troi watch as the DOTS move closer...
closer...right up to the perimeter of Engineering.
The dots begin surrounding Engineering -- which looks
like it's being swarmed over by a sea of ants.

110   INT. ENGINEERING                                           110

As before. The security guards have taken positions
around the room, all weapons trained on the doors.

Worf is standing in front of the warp core, Bat'leth in-
hand.

WORF
(calls out)
Charge weapons!

A massive HUM of power fills the room as all of the
phaser weapons begin charging. It's tense -- everyone
standing ready with their weapons charging. This is
the moment of truth.

Worf stands ready, phaser in one hand, Bat'leth in the
other. This is Worf at his purest -- the warrior ready
for battle.

111   INT. BRIDGE                                                111

Riker and Troi, as before, watching the schematic of
the ship. The DOTS representing Borg have now
completely surrounded Engineering on all sides,
including the deck directly above and below. In
essence, the Borg have cocooned Engineering from the
rest of the ship.

112   INT. ENGINEERING                                           112

As before. Worf and the security team in their
positions, tense. A few beats of silence...then they
start to hear soft SCRATCHING coming from somewhere
behind the walls -- it sounds like rats skittering
through the walls and ceiling of an old house.

Everyone stays alert, checks and re-checks their
weapons... a couple of hard swallows... then from
somewhere up above a LOUD, METALLIC CLANG. Then a
large, SCRAPING SOUND that seems to start at one end of
the room and travel to the other. There's an
overpowering sense of creatures just outside those
walls, moving about. It's unnerving, even for crack
Starfleet troops.

113   INT. BRIDGE                                                113

Riker and Troi watching the display. The Borg dots
teeming around Engineering like ants on a candy bar.

114   INT. ENGINEERING                                           114

The clawing, skittering, clanging noises increase and
get louder...

... we expect to see the Borg bursting into the room at
any moment. Worf tightens his grip on his Bat'leth,
teeth bared. Unbearable tension and then...

The noises begin to FADE AWAY... eventually
disappearing all together. If anything, the silence is
even scarier. Worf's eyes narrow. He looks around the
room, all his senses alert, waiting for the slightest
sign of the Borg... but nothing happens.

115   INT. BRIDGE                                                115

Riker and Troi react to the diagram as the Borg dots
begin moving away from Engineering. It looks like the
swarm of ants have left the candy bar and are on the
ground, moving toward the forward part of the ship.

TROI
They're bypassing Engineering...

RIKER
Where the hell are they going?

OFF the mystery...

CUT TO:

116   INT. BORG HIVE                                             116

CLOSE ON DATA'S FACE. His eyes are closed -- he is in
the android equivalent of sleep. CAMERA ROTATING and
PUSHING IN on his face as we hear the overlapping
sounds of VOICES from Data's past -- Picard, Riker,
Troi, the Enterprise crew, aliens he's met, Data's own
voice... bits and pieces of his life...

The theme of the sound bites should be Data's quest for
humanity: Picard giving him advice, Troi counseling
him, Soong talking to his son, etc. The last line of
dialogue we hear is Data saying "I want to be more
human."

BORG QUEEN'S VOICE
Data...

Data's eyes fly open, now awake. We PULL BACK
revealing that Data is still strapped to the Borg
operating table... his right arm and shoulder are
encased in some kind of strange cybernetic SHELL,
obscured from view. Clear tubes run out of the shell
into Borg machinery -- liquid is coursing through the
tubes. A couple of Borg drones are moving about the
room, carrying out various tasks.

There's been a change since we've been here last.
There are now several Plexiglass CYLINDERS surrounding
Data's table -- each of them filled with some kind of
murky red fluid, which is swirling around. Every once
in awhile, something that looks like RAW FLESH bumps up
against the clear Plexiglass, then disappears again.
We don't know what these tubes are for, but they're
definitely creepy.

Data takes all this in, but there is nothing he can do,
he's still immobilized.

Suddenly the table ROTATES and begins to MOVE up toward
the mist and cabling at the top of the ceiling. It
stops a few feet away... and Data finds himself face-to-
face with the Borg Queen again.

BORG QUEEN
You've taken your first step
toward perfection. How does it
feel?

DATA
I do not know what you are
referring to.

BORG QUEEN
That's because you haven't been
properly... stimulated yet.

A WHOOSH of hydraulic power signals another movement by
the Borg Queen. She slithers through the air and down
slightly, so that she is on the same level as Data.
She looks at the cybernetic shell that is encasing
Data's right arm, which OPENS at her silent command and
moves away...

We can now see that all of the skin has been removed
from Data's right arm, showing the INNER-WORKINGS of
his android limb -- circuitry and servos, etc. But on
the top of the mechanical forearm there is something
new -- a small PATCH of HUMAN FLESH held in place with
various nasty-looking hooks and clamps and small tubes
carrying blood. It's a delicate, fragile piece of
organic life on an ugly, mechanical surface.

Data looks down at the patch of flesh with a little
puzzlement.

BORG QUEEN
(re: flesh)
Do you know what this is, Data?

DATA
It would appear that you are
attempting to graft organic skin
onto my endo-skeletal structure.

BORG QUEEN
What a cold description... for
such a beautiful gift.

She smiles slightly, utterly confident. She leans her
face in close to Data's still immobilized right arm.

117   EXTREME CLOSE UP - DATA'S ARM                              117

We are so close to the patch of flesh that we can see
the individual hairs. The Borg Queen's LIPS move into
frame, and she EXHALES a long and sensuous breath. We
see GOOSE BUMPS form on the skin, and the hairs stand
straight up in response.

118   NEW ANGLE                                                  118

As Data's eyes widen and he looks down at the skin in
surprise -- this is a sensation he's never felt before.
The Borg Queen sees the look on his face and smiles.

BORG QUEEN
Was that good for you?

Data can barely describe the sensation. But clearly,
it was pleasurable.

DATA
It was... interesting.

He looks at her.

DATA
Do it again... please.

As she smiles...

CUT TO:

119   EXT. RUBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                  119

A tiny, single-story house -- one or two rooms at the
most, in serious need of repair and maintenance. No
yard. The house sits on dirt. The nearest other
structure is at least a hundred yards away. A very
solitary place. The windows are dark, painted over
from the inside.

Some large pieces of exotic-looking EQUIPMENT are
sitting off the front porch.

After a beat, the front door opens, letting out a soft,
feeble light.

Ruby steps out onto the porch, carrying a gallon size
plastic jug. The light from the house now lights the
equipment a little, giving us a better view. There's
a contraption that appears to be a PUMP of some kind,
with a funnel on top, spigot at the bottom, and several
stages of filters and tubing in between. Ruby sets the
jug underneath the spigot... then sits down for a
moment on the edge of the porch. She takes a breath
and runs a hand through her hair, stretches her back,
trying to work out some of the kinks in her neck. An
exhausting day.

120   PICARD                                                     120

is watching her intently from afar. He's concealed
behind a supporting beam of one the town's many
WINDMILLS. He's in shadow, hidden from Ruby's view.

121   RUBY                                                       121

pulls off her jacket. she's wearing a pull-over
shirt... and in one motion she pulls off the shirt,
revealing only a tee-shirt underneath, sleeves torn off
long ago. She stands up... kicks off her boots...
undoes her pants... and begins sliding the jeans off
her hips...

122   PICARD                                                     122

is surprised. Glances around, a little awkward. This
really isn't why he came out here.

123   RUBY                                                       123

kicks aside the jeans. She's now down to tee-shirt and
panties. She grabs the bottom of the tee-shirt...
pulls it off...

124   PICARD                                                     124

doesn't want to look, but can't help himself...

125   RUBY                                                       125

moves to the side of the porch... and steps into a
large ENVIROMENTAL SUIT, a bulky one-piece with gloves
and helmet attached.

126   PICARD                                                     126

is a little relieved... keeps watching...

127   RUBY                                                       127

has now encased herself in the thick, rubbery suit...
pulls over a HELMET with a gas mask. She walks over to
an OIL DRUM marked with a distinctive BIO-HAZARD
SYMBOL. She carefully opens the lid... takes a metal
pitcher... reaches down into the drum and scoops out a
pitcher-full of TOXIC WASTE. She closes the lid, walks
over to the pump-filter contraption. She pours the
sludge-like waste into the funnel...primes the pump...
makes a few adjustments to the filters... and then
turns the spigot...

After a beat, a trickle of CLEAR LIQUID starts to come
out of the spigot. Ruby steps back and pulls off the
helmet.

128   PICARD                                                     128

watches, curious about what she's doing...

129   RUBY                                                       129

is now out of the bio-suit again... pulling on her
shirt and jeans... grabs her jacket... turns off the
lights in the house, and shuts the front door behind
her. She begins walking toward the windmill.

130   PICARD                                                     130

steps behind the girder, stays very still in the
shadows... waits quietly as Ruby passes by the windmill
without a glance and heads into town. After she's
gone, Picard steps out from his hiding place, watches
her go, then quickly heads for Ruby's house...

131   FRONT PORCH                                                131

Picard opens the front door and goes inside... but he
doesn't notice that at the base of the doorjamb a small
RED LIGHT starts flashing -- some sort of silent alarm.

132   INT. RUBY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                             132

Picard ENTERS and closes the door behind him. It's
dark. He fumbles around for a light switch... finally
locates one... and a soft, golden glow fills the room.

The house has only one room, which functions as a
living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc. This is also
Ruby's DARKROOM. The windows have been painted black,
and there are photographic plates and futuristic photo-
equipment all around. But the most striking feature of
the house are the large, hanging cloth-printed
PHOTOGRAPHS. They vary in size and shape. Some are
hanging on walls, others hang from the ceiling in mid-
air, still others are stacked on the few pieces of
furniture that's here. The absence of paper has forced
Ruby to print photos on anything she can find --
bed sheets, shirts, pieces of upholstery, backs of
carpeting, etc. Picard stands there for a moment,
taking in the scene -- he's never been in anyplace
quite like this. The cloth photos give the room a
feeling of a small, intensely personal gallery.

Picard moves around the room, looking from photo to
photo... hunting for the elusive shots of the missile
silo... and as he does, we get our first close look at
Ruby's images, and they tell us a great deal about
her...

She has an artistic eye for finding beauty in the
mundane and the ugly. There are pictures of hope
amidst despair... beauty amongst devastation. There
seems to be a theme running through the photographs --
a romantic, almost idealistic sense of optimism.

At one point, Picard finds a photograph he recognizes.
It's the rusted-out hover car she photographed on the
streets of Resurrection. It's an ugly, decrepit piece
of junk... but there in the center, spot-lighted by a
single ray of sunshine... is a tiny flower about to
bloom.

Picard takes in the image for a brief moment... then
pushes onward... goes to a file of photos sitting in a
box... begins sorting through them quickly... we see
PRE-WAR photos printed on real paper. They show a
younger Ruby with her parents... Resurrection the way
it used to look... Ruby with a dog...

Picard pauses, frowns... gets the odd feeling that
someone is watching him. He turns around to see...

133   HIMSELF                                                    133

A three foot PHOTOGRAPH OF PICARD is drying in the air
behind him.

Ruby must've taken the photo when Picard was on the
street talking to Scrimm. It was taken through a
telephoto lens, a close-up of Picard's face -- he looks
focused, determined, heroic. It's a remarkable shot of
the Captain, and even Picard is a little taken aback by
the image. She's captured the essence of the man.

CLICK-CLACK! The sound of a shotgun being cocked.
Picard freezes... slowly turns around to see who's
there...

134   RUBBY                                                      134

is standing in the open doorway, a shotgun leveled at
Picard.

RUBY
You should pay closer attention to
those little red lights.

Picard glances down at the doorway, sees the flashing
red light in the doorjamb. He's busted.

RUBY
You know, I'd be perfectly
justified in shooting you right
now.

Picard glances at the photograph of himself.

PICARD
I'd say you already have.

RUBY
Don't flatter yourself. I take
pictures of a lot of junk.

She perches herself on the arm of a small couch, holds
the gun loosely, but never taking the aim away from
Picard.

RUBY
Okay, let's hear it. I'm sure you
have a great explanation for why
those rocket photos are so
important you broke into my house.

PICARD
We're trying to repair Doctor
Cochrane's ship. It's been
damaged and --

RUBY
We?

PICARD
Myself... and a few other friends
of Zephram's.

RUBY
Friends from Cornell...

PICARD
Some.

RUBY
Lie. That's one. Keep going.

PICARD
A key piece of the ship has been
destroyed... and our only hope to
reconstruct it is if one of your
photographs shows us what it
looked like.

RUBY
(considers)
All right. Truth. I believe that
one. Why is it so urgent you
couldn't wait until morning?

PICARD
We have to launch his ship by
tomorrow afternoon.

RUBY
Or...?

Picard has to come up with something -- decides to
throw her off with a high-tech explanation.

PICARD
Or the shielding around the
plutonium core will begin to
deteriorate. Within a day, the
entire silo will become so
radioactive that no one will be
able to come near it for a hundred
years.

Ruby eyes him evenly.

RUBY
Lie. That's two. One more, and
I pull the trigger.

Picard is starting to get angry.

PICARD
Why are you being so difficult?
All I'm asking for is to look at
one of the photographs. It'll
take five minutes.

RUBY
And all I'm asking for is the
truth. That would take five
minutes.
(beat)
For all I know, you caused the
explosions at the silo... and now
you're trying to steal Zephram's
ship.

PICARD
I am not a thief...

Ruby's had enough -- her temper flares and she gets off
the couch, takes a threatening step toward Picard.

RUBY
No, you're a petty burglar and a
liar...
(beat)
You're no friend of Zephram's. He
is a great man. He's not like you
or me or any of the other zombies
walking around this town.

Picard jumps in with a quiet, forceful quality:

PICARD
No. He's a man with vision. He
can see beyond the problems that
surround us. He knows there's a
better future out there for
everyone... a future where crime,
poverty and war are things of the
past... a future where we reach
out and seek our destiny in the
stars.
(beat)
I believe in that future, too,
Ruby. I believe in it in every
fiber of my being. And I'm
telling you... if we don't launch
that warp ship tomorrow, there's
a very good chance that future
will never happen.

She eyes him for a moment -- and we're not sure if his
words have had any effect.

Ruby still has her doubts, but decides to go with her
gut...and finally hands him the photographs. Picard
glances through them -- his expression tells us the
photo he needs is in there.

PICARD
You won't regret this.

They share a look... and then Picard turns and walks
off into the night. Ruby watches him go... and we can
see on her face a confused jumble of mixed emotions.
Something about that man has touched her...

135   NIGHT SCPOE POV                                            135

A telescopic, green and white image of Picard walking
away from Ruby's home.

136   LIEUTENANT SCRIMM                                          136

is watching Picard through a set of night vision
binoculars, perched on the roof of a nearby building.
He frowns, wondering what Picard is up to...

CUT TO:

137   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE DEFLECTOR DISH                     137

The giant DEFLECTOR ARRAY at the front of the ship --
a giant, round, bowl-shaped array used for
communications and shielding. As we watch, FOUR
HATCHES OPEN surrounding the dish and BORG start to
emerge from the interior of the ship and CRAWL OUT on
the hull. The Borg do not need pressure suits or
breathing equipment -- they crawl around the hull with
ease and onto the deflector dish...

PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

138   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - VIEWSCREEN                        138

Where Riker, Troi, Worf and N.D.s are watching this
image on the Viewscreen.

RIKER
What are they doing?

WORF
They appear to be modifying the
deflector dish.

TROI
To do what? If they wanted a
weapon, they could've taken over
a phaser bank or torpedo bay...

RIKER
Deflector dish... why the
deflector dish...?

WORF
It doesn't make sense. The
deflector is only used for
shielding and long range
sensors...

Riker stares at the screen... notices something.

RIKER
Computer -- magnify grid twenty-
one alpha.

The image on the Viewscreen ZOOMS IN to a specific
point on the deflector dish, giving us a clear view of
two Borg who have opened a gigantic panel on the dish.
They appear top be modifying power conduits in some
fashion.

WORF
They're re-routing the deflector
power conduits...

RIKER
Computer -- thermal enhancement.

The image now is overlaid with an INFRARED VIEW of what
they're doing. The power conduits are glowing bright
red, very hot -- we can see the heat signature travel
back behind the dish and connect to a corkscrew-shaped
coil, which is pulsing.

RIKER
They're connecting the conduits to
subspace communications...

WORF
(realizing)
They're converting the deflector
dish into an antennae...

TROI
They may be trying to send a
message to the other Borg...the
Borg in this time period...

WORF
What kind of message?

RIKER
(thinking)
If it was me... I'd say "attack
Earth now... in the 21st
century... they'll be too strong
in the 24th."

They think about this for a moment as they watch the
Borg swarming on the deflector array.

WORF
We have to stop them from sending
that message.

RIKER
Agreed. Options?

WORF
Destroy the deflector dish.

TROI
Can we aim our dorsal phasers at
it?

Riker shakes his head.

RIKER
We've lost control of all weapons
systems... Transporters are
down... we can't get to a
Shuttlecraft... and it would take
us too long to fight our way down
to deflector control...

They think.

WORF
There is another way, Commander.
Do you remember your zero-G combat
training?

Riker looks a little wary at the suggestion.

RIKER
I remember it made me sick.

TROI
(to Worf)
What are you suggesting?

RIKER
I think Mister Worf is suggesting
that we go outside for a little
stroll...

OFF their expressions...

CUT TO:

139   CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH                                      139

Another one of Ruby's cloth-printed photos, this one a
clear view of the base of the missile engines --
Cochrane standing underneath the massive rocket nozzle.
Above him on the fuselage is the crucial throttle-valve
assembly.

GEORDI'S VOICE
I'm almost afraid to say this,
Captain... but I think it's going
to work.

MOVE TO REVEAL we're in:

140   INT. MISSILE SILO - LOWER CATWALK - DAY                    140

The cloth photo is hanging from a beam on the catwalk.
Geordi and Picard are watching a couple of N.D.s attach
the newly-built throttle assembly to the side of the
ship. The N.D.s are using high-tech welding tools and
sparks are flying. As they talk, they head back up the
catwalk toward the control room...

PICARD
Where's you get the alloy for the
throttle itself?

GEORDI
They used copper pipes in their
plumbing... so I melted it down...
and fused it with some tritanium
from one of our phaser casings.
(beat)
It's not the strongest alloy...
but it's better than all this
crude aluminum and steel.

141   INT. MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                     141

As Geordi and Picard ENTER. Lange is checking out a
launch console.

The room is now humming with power -- it's beginning to
look like the place is up and running. Picard stops
near the desk.

PICARD
Mister Lange -- have you brought
the computer systems back on-line
yet?

LANGE
Aye, Captain. This trinary
language is pretty archaic... but
I think I understand it now.

PICARD
Good.

As they speak, CAMERA MOVES in on the metal canister
of lotion Picard set on the desk earlier...

142   EXT. MONTONA WOODS - DAY - CONTINUOUS                      142

Scrimm and three militia guards are huddled around a
cluster of military surveillance gear, listening to
Picard and Geordi's conversation. Far in the distance,
we can see the missile silo.

PICARD'S VOICE
Are we on schedule? The Vulcan
ship will be here in less than two
hours.

GEORDI'S VOICE
It'll be tight, but we should make
it.

PICARD'S VOICE
What about our warp signature? It
has to be strong enough for them
to detect.

GEORDI'S VOICE
I've enhanced the plasma injectors --
don't worry, they'll see it.

PICARD'S VOICE
Well, with any luck... the Vulcans
will land outside Resurrection
tomorrow morning... and Earth will
never be the same again.

Scrimm and his men listen with growing alarm -- it
sounds like Picard is planning an invasion!

143   INT. MISSILE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                     143

As before.

PICARD
All right. I'd better start
familiarizing myself with the
flight controls.

A console BUZZES. Lange moves to it, and activates a
small color video MONITOR. It shows an external view
of the MISSILE silo, just outside the hatch. Beverly
can be seen standing nearby with a now conscious
Zephram Cochrane.

LANGE
Doctor Crusher's at the access
hatch, Captain.

PICARD
Let her in.

Lange hits a couple of buttons...

CUT TO:

144   CLOSE ON COCHRANE'S FACE                                   144

A short time later. His head is bandaged, and he's
conscious, but frankly he looks like hell. He sits
back, looking a little overwhelmed.

COCHRANE
Let me get this straight... you're
from the future... I'm about to
change history... and all I have
to do is sit here and let you fly
my ship?

145   WIDER                                                      145

Picard, Geordi and Beverly are standing around
Cochrane, who is sitting in a high-backed chair in a
corner of the Control Room.

PICARD
That's right.

He studies their faces -- sees they're serious. He
smiles a little ruefully.

COCHRANE
And people say I'm crazy...

Picard smiles.

PICARD
I assure you, Doctor, that after
today... no one will ever call you
that again.

Cochrane considers them...finally nods, what the hell.

COCHRANE
Just do me a favor... bring my
ship back in one piece.

PICARD
That's a promise.

Picard turns and walks off with Beverly. Geordi moves
to Cochrane with a little bit of awe.

GEORDI
Doctor... my name is Geordi La
Forge. I'm an engineer. Can I
shake your hand?

Cochrane is touched by Geordi's obvious respect. They
shake hands.

COCHRANE
I wish I could go with you. Is
there anything I can do to help?

GEORDI
Not really... but I do have about
a thousand questions I've always
wanted to ask you.

COCHRANE
Since time is short... why don't
you pick the top ten and fire
away?

Geordi smiles...

146   PICARD AND BEVERLY                                         146

have moved to another part of the room. Beverly looks
exhausted. She sets her medkit on a table and plops
down into a chair. Mid-conversation.

PICARD
(surprised)
You actually performed surgery...?

BEVERLY
It was an experience. Metal
scalpels... needle and thread...

She looks up with a smile, pulls a small DEVICE out of
the medkit -- a surgical transporter.

BEVERLY
(re: device)
But I had a little help. Surgical
transporter. I used it to beam
out most of the bone fragments
from his brain.

PICARD
How did Doctor Almack react to
that?

BEVERLY
He was so confused by what I was
doing, I don't think he even
noticed.
(beat)
Any word from the Enterprise?

PICARD
Not yet.

BEVERLY
You think they're still up there?

PICARD
(wry)
If they're not... we'd better get
used to living in Montana.

BEVERLY
(light)
That might not be so bad... at
least for you.

She's kidding, but Picard is a little defensive.

PICARD
What's that supposed to mean?

There is no animosity or hint of jealousy in Beverly's
attitude, she's simply making an observation about
someone she cares about.

BEVERLY
I saw the way you looker at her...
and I know that look.

Picard doesn't want to argue about this -- to him, it's
a pointless conversation.

PICARD
Regardless of how I may feel about
Ruby... our fates lie along
different paths. Nothing can
change that.

BEVERLY
You want some advice? Don't do
this again.
(off his look)
You know exactly what I mean.

PICARD
Beverly, there were many reasons
why you and I...

BEVERLY
I'd call them excuses. And the
first excuse on both our lists was
our "sense of duty." We convinced
ourselves that it was more
important than anything else. And
you know what? It's not.

She holds his look for a moment.

PICARD
(neutral)
I have a ship to launch.

Picard turns and leaves. Beverly watches him go...
wondering whether her words had any affect...

147   EXT. RUBY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    147

Ruby is turning off the spigot on the filter-pump. The
plastic jug is now filled with the clear fluid --
silver halide. She caps the jug, picks it up, begins
walking up on the porch...then hesitates for a
moment... looks out over the horizon.

She hesitates... then frowns and goes inside...

Ruby comes inside, sets down the jug... begins to pick
up some more glass plates... stops... thinks... looks
up. Only a few feet away is the large picture of
Picard. She doesn't want to look at him, doesn't want
to think about him... but there he is.

She glances back at the open door... struggles for a
moment... then makes a decision.

Despite herself, she can't get Picard out of her head.
With a little frustration, she grabs her camera bag and
heads for the door...

149   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE                                149

in Earth orbit.

150   INT. BORG HIVE                                             150

ANGLE ON CEILING as the Borg Queen descends from her
nesting place down towards the camera... ultimately
stopping just a few feet away. She speaks directly to
the camera.

BORG QUEEN
How do you feel?

151   CLOSE ON DATA'S HAND                                       151

His right hand is made of FLESH -- it has color,
fingernails, hair, sweat. It's completely human in
every way. His fingers move slightly, and then the
hand begins to rise. We follow his hand as it comes up
and touches his FACE, which is also FLESH. The gold
color is gone, his hair is tousled and natural-looking.
Even his eyes are real now -- blue. He touches his
face tentatively, his expression confused... but
intrigued.

DATA
Different.

The Borg Queen descends closer. Data's arms are now
free, but he is still restrained on the table. The
rest of his body is still android, mechanical.

Data touches his two hands together, feeling the
sensations, flesh against machine. He touches his face
and lips, discovering himself in a totally new way.

DATA
My internal sensors tell me the
ambient temperature in the room is
ten point two degrees Celsius...
(wondrous)
But my skin tells me it is cold.

As he talks, we can see that he's becoming seduced by
his own newfound senses.

DATA
My visual acuity has been reduced
by seventy-eight percent... and I
can no longer perceive light
beyond the ultraviolet or the
infrared...
(beat)
But I can see.

It's an amazing moment, Data riding a wave of feeling
and emotion like he's never had before. The Borg Queen
watches, pleased. She hovers close to him.

BORG QUEEN
Until today... your emotions were
trapped inside an artificial
shell. You didn't know what it
was to truly feel.
(beat)
And there's so much more for you
to experience.  I will guide you
into a world of sensation unlike
anything you can imagine.
(beat)
All you have to do... is give us
access to your neural net.

Data looks at her, suddenly shocked back into reality.

DATA
No. I will not betray my friends.

BORG QUEEN
They're not your friends...
they've held you back... kept you
from your destiny...

DATA
That is not true. They have tried
to help me.

BORG QUEEN
Have they given you what I have
given you? Did they even try?

DATA
I... do not want this...

But his words have a certain hollow quality to them.
He is no longer as convinced as he was before and the
Borg Queen notes this immediately. She reaches out
with a hand and gently strokes Data's cheek.

BORG QUEEN
You're becoming more human all the
time, Data. Now you're learning
how to lie.

DATA
I wish to... go back to the way I
was.

BORG QUEEN
More lies.

She SLAPS him hard across the face. Data feels the
pain, the shock. A small trickle of blood comes from
his mouth. He looks at her in surprise, but before he
can say anything she moves forward and KISSES him on
the mouth deeply and intensely. It's a disturbing and
erotic moment. She pulls back. Data reels, trying to
sort out the rapid succession of pleasure and pain.
Her voice drops to a whisper and she moves even closer
to him, face-to-face... seductive... beguiling.

BORG QUEEN
Have you ever know a woman? Do
you know what it's like to feel
her breath on your face... her
skin against yours... flesh
against flesh?

DATA
My creator did not intend for me
to experience these things.

BORG QUEEN
I'm your creator now.

She rubs her body against his, cat-like... then pulls
him to her and kisses him deeply. Off the image of
their bizarre embrace...

CUT TO:

152   INT. BRIDGE                                                152

Riker, Worf, and three Security N.D.s are pulling on
SPACESUITS. The suits are form-fitting, sleek, no
bulky oxygen tanks. The helmets are the same -- they
conform to the contours of the skull and face.

WORF
(to Riker)
You will have to realign the
targeting array of the quantum
torpedo... and reprogram the
warhead for the localized
detonation.
(beat)
There's only one torpedo left...

RIKER
I guess I'd better get it right
the first time.

WORF
(to all)
The Borg will undoubtedly attack.
Set phasers to rotating
modulation.

The Security Officers check their phasers and wait as
Riker and Worf finish putting on their suits. Riker
straps a tool case to his suit.

RIKER
Ready?

Everyone nods. Riker goes to a wall panel and
activates the control. The Airlock door seen earlier
OPENS. Riker turns back to Troi.

TROI
Good luck.

Riker nods. Then he, Worf, and the Guards ENTER the
airlock and Troi close the door behind them.

153   INT. AIRLOCK                                               153

A tiny room separating the Bridge from the outer hull.

RIKER
Depressurize.

Worf hits a control and the room DEPRESSURIZES with a
HISSING SOUND.

WORF
(to others)
Activate magnetic constrictors.

They all activate controls on their wrists and there is
a faint hum of power as the suits are magnetized.

Riker hits another control and the OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR
SLIDES OPEN, revealing the vast vacuum of SPACE. They
begin to walk out of the airlock...

154   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE - AIRLOCK                          154

As Riker and his team come out of the airlock on the
top of the saucer section. It's a spectacular sight as
the small group of figures, with weapons at the ready,
marches toward the leading edge of the saucer. The
scene is lit by light reflected by the Earth, which
hangs above the ship.

155   ON RIKER   WORF                                            155

As they approach the edge. Worf gives a hand signal
and the rest of the team spreads out into a tactical
deployment and drops down onto their bellies. They
crawl up to the very edge of the saucer and pause.
Worf looks at Riker, who looks a little queasy.

WORF
(to Riker)
Are you alright?

RIKER
Just a little queasy...

WORF
Try not to look at the stars...
keep your eyes on the ship.

RIKER
Right.

WORF
And Commander, whatever you do...
do not vomit in your exo-suit. It
would be... unpleasant.

RIKER
I'll keep that in mind.

Riker takes a few deep breaths to steady himself.

RIKER
(to all)
Over and under!

They all quickly scramble over the edge and onto the
underside of the saucer.

The CAMERA ROTATES AND SPINS with them as they
traverse to the underside of the hull -- they're
upside down relative to their previous position, but
there's no up or down in space and their magnetized
suits hold them to the hull.

It's a dizzying moment as we try to orient ourselves to
their new position. From this angle, the Enterprise
appears to be upside down!

Once they're on the underside of the saucer, they can
see the rest of the ship laid out above them.

156   NEW ANGLE - THEIR POV                                      156

The deflector dish (which is now above us) is covered
with dozens of Borg drones, who are working to modify
it. Some of them turn and see us.

157   RIKER AND WORF                                             157

Begin running toward the torpedo tube on the saucer.
(Running is difficult, they must keep one foot on the
hull at all times.) Several Borg PHASER SHOTS whip past
them as the Borg open fire.

158   THE BORG                                                   158

A DOZEN of them leave the work on the dish and begin
skittering down (which is normally up) the
interconnecting dorsal on all fours toward our heroes
like a swarm of ants -- a frightening sight.

159   A SECURITY GUARD                                           159

Is HIT by a phaser shot and goes FLYING OFF into space.

160   THE TORPEDO TUBE                                           160

Riker reaches the opening to the torpedo tube, bends
down and opens the hatch. Borg phaser shots hitting
all around him. The open hatch cover provides some
protection from the Borg fire.

RIKER
Worf! I'm going to need at least
five minutes!

WORF
Understood!

Worf and his team lie down on the hull and begin
exchanging fire with the approaching mass of Borg.

They pick off a few Borg, who also go FLYING into
space. As Riker begins to work...

CUT TO:

161   INT. MISSILE SILO - SERIES OF SHOTS                        161

Quick cuts:

-- Picard and Geordi strapping themselves into the
Phoenix cockpit.

-- In the Control Room, the Starfleet N.D.s put on 21st
century headsets to communicate with the Phoenix
cockpit.

-- Cochrane sitting in his chair, holding his head, but
rapt with attention. Beverly checking him with her
MEDKIT, which is sitting open on a console nearby.

-- The BLAST DOOR begins closing.

-- Geordi's hands flipping switches, working the
controls.

OVER THESE SHOTS:

The Security N.D.s moving about the control room, which
is now humming with power.

The huge steel blast door separating the control room
from the silo has been CLOSED.

GEORDI'S COM VOICE
Pre-ignition sequence complete.
Going to internal power.

LANGE

163   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       163

Picard, Geordi making final adjustments to the control
panels. Both are wearing 21st century communications
headsets. Picard exchanges a look with Geordi.

PICARD
Ready to make a little history?

GEORDI
Always am.

PICARD
Phoenix to control.
(hits a control)
Initiating five minute
countdown... mark.

A few monitors in the cockpit indicate that the
countdown is underway.

164   INT. CONTROL ROOM                                          164

Lange and the other N.D.s watching the countdown.
Suddenly a console BUZZES. Lange goes to the monitor
seen earlier, hits a switch -- the monitor comes alive,
shows that Ruby is now standing outside at the hatch.
Lange reacts in surprise.

Picard and Geordi working the controls, watching the
readings, etc. We hear Lange's com voice:

LANGE'S COM VOICE
Phoenix, we have a problem out
here. There's a woman at the
outer hatch... says her name's
Ruby Sloan and she wants to see
the Captain.

Picard and Geordi react -- her timing is pretty bad.

LANGE'S COM VOICE
What do you want me to do, sir?

GEORDI
We can't let her in... she'll see
Cochrane isn't making the flight.

PICARD
We can't leave her out there.
When the ship launches... she'll
be killed.

GEORDI
Tell her to go back to
Resurrection.

PICARD
She's a very... determined woman.
(to com)
Phoenix to control. Mister
Lange... let her in.

LANGE'S COM VOICE
Aye, sir.

166   EXT. MISSILE SILO - DAY                                    166

Ruby standing by the hatch, trying to look calm...
Scrimm and three Militia Soldiers holding her at
gunpoint. The hatch hisses and POPS OPEN. Scrimm
shoves a gun into Ruby's side -- get going. As they
start to crawl inside...

167   INT. CONTROL ROOM                                          167

Lange and the other N.D.s have focused their attention
on the countdown. Ruby climbs down the ladder, a tense
look on her face.

LANGE
Ms. Sloane, if you'll have a seat,
I'll let you talk to --

Suddenly, the three heavily-armed militia soldiers jump
down the ladder from the hatch. One of the Starfleet
N.D.s goes for a phaser, and a soldier BLASTS him
backward with a spray of bullets from his automatic
weapon. Everyone else freezes. A tense beat, then
Scrimm climbs down the ladder and looks around the
room...

CUT TO:

168   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE - BATTLE ON THE HULL               168

Riker in the torpedo tube, frantically working. He
begins to physically MOVE the torpedo tube itself like
he's moving the barrel of a huge cannon... as he
struggles to aim it toward the huge deflector dish...

169   WORF AND THE SECURITY GUARDS                               169

are about fifty feet away from Riker. From their prone
positions, they try to keep the Borg at bay, BLASTING
them off the hull one by one. They have taken cover
behind some outcroppings of equipment on the hull of
the ship. The Borg have to cross an open field of
metal to get to them, making then easy targets.

Suddenly the Borg change tactics. From the deflector
dish high above them, Borg begin LAUNCHING THEMSELVES
directly at the Starfleet Officers, jumping off the
dish and flying through the vacuum of space like
paratroopers. This tips the balance. There are too
many targets to defend from above and below. One of
the flying Borg CRASHES into a Security Guard and a
vicious hand-to-hand FIGHT erupts. The Borg SLASHES
the guard's pressure suit, which DEPRESSURIZES killing
the man instantly. Worf FIRES  a phaser blast into the
Borg, knocking him off the hull and into space.

Worf turns to Riker.

WORF
Commander, you're five minutes are
up!

170   RIKER                                                      170

swings the torpedo tube into place, aiming it at the
deflector dish. He hits a control on the side of the
tube... and a QUANTUM TORPEDO automatically slides up
from below and LOCKS INTO position in the tube, like a
panel on the torpedo and begins working on the
circuitry.

171   INT. BRIDGE                                                171

Troi in command, watching the VIEWSCREEN, which shows
a different angle of the battle on the hull.

COM OFFICER
The Borg are charging the subspace
emitters.

TROI
How long until they can send a
message?

COM OFFICER
About seven or eight minutes.

TROI
Computer -- this is Commander
Deanna Troi. Initiate self-
destruct in six minutes, thirty
seconds. Authorization Troi,

COMPUTER VOICE
Countdown underway. Self-destruct

Monitors all around the Bridge show the countdown.

172   ANGLE ON A MONITOR                                         172

which says "SELF-DESTRUCT IN 6:24...6:23...6:22..."

CUT TO:

173   INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTROL ROOM                           173

The Sergeant is examining one of the monitors. The
display says "LIFT-OFF, T-MINUS 50 seconds...49...
48..."

SERGEANT
No good, sir. They're on internal
power. We can't stop the launch
from here.

SCRIMM
(re: blast doors)
What about these doors?

PRIVATE
They're locked down tight from the
inside.

SERGEANT
And those doors were made to
withstand a nuclear attack.

Scrimm looks frustrated for a moment...then turns his
attention to Ruby.

174   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       174

As before.

GEORDI
One minute to launch.

SCRIMM'S COM VOICE
Mister Picard... this is
Lieutenant Scrimm. I'm going to
have to insist that you shut down
the launch. You see, I know what
you're doing... and I'm not going
to just stand by and let it
happen.
(beat)
Stop the launch, or I'll kill
every one of your people out
here... and I think you know
who'll be first.

As Picard reacts in shock...

175   INT. CONTROL ROOM                                          175

Scrimm is now holding Ruby by the arm. He shoves the
com headset to her mouth.

SCRIMM
Say hello...

Ruby is scared, but trying to keep it together.

RUBY
(to com)
Jean-Luc... remember that future
we talked about? It's all that
matters...
(beat)
Launch the ship.

Picard reacts to her voice, but keeps working the
controls, trying to concentrate. Scrimm draws his gun.

SCRIMM
Go ahead -- launch it. Ruby will
be here when you get back... but
she won't have a whole lot to say.

176   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       176

Geordi and Picard exchange a tense look. Picard
struggles. It's a difficult moment -- what does he do?
The countdown clock is approaching 15 seconds...14...
13...

Everything hangs in the balance -- Ruby's life, the
future of the Earth, Picard's feelings, his duty...

Finally, Picard reaches out hits a control -- the
countdown clock stops at 11 seconds.

GEORDI
Captain --

PICARD
(to com)
This is Picard. I've suspended
the launch sequence.

SCRIMM'S COM VOICE
Thanks. Now, why don't you join
us and we'll have a little talk?

Picard unstraps himself and takes off the headset.

GEORDI
Captain... we've got less than ten
minutes before that Vulcan ship
leaves the system. We've got to
go now.

PICARD
It'll have to wait. Come on.

Geordi quickly starts unstrapping himself...

177   INT. MISSILE SILO - CATWALK                                177

Picard and Geordi stop outside the massive blast doors,
which are separating them from the control room.

PICARD
Geordi, can you see into the room?

Geordi looks at the blast doors... and he does so, the
electronic PUPILS in his eyes rotate, change shape and
color.

178   GEORDI'S POV                                               178

A high-tech INFRARED VIEW of the door, but we can't see
through it -- it's opaque.

179   RESUME                                                     179

GEORDI
No... the door's too thick.

PICARD
(frustrated)
Then we'll just have to assume
it's still there...

GEORDI
What's still there?

PICARD
Get a tricorder. You're going to
have to track my exact position in
that room...

Geordi moves off. Clearly, Picard has a plan...

CUT TO:

180   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE - BATTLE ON THE HULL               180

Riker finishes working on the torpedo... he closes the
panel... turns and reaches for the fire control
mechanism. She glances up -- there's a BORG flying
through space directly at him! Riker tries to bring up
his phaser, but it's too late. The Borg SLAMS into
him.

Riker makes a desperate grab for the torpedo tube itself,
trying to hold on, but the momentum of the Borg impact
is too great -- they both tumble off into space together,
away from the ship.

CUT TO:

181   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - VIEWSCREEN                      181

A shocked Troi watches Riker and the Borg tumbling away
into space on the Viewscreen. They are engaged in a
zero-gee hand to hand fight -- an incredible sight.

COMPUTER VOICE
Self-destruct in three minutes...

CUT TO:

182   INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTROL ROOM                           182

Scrimm still has the gun on Ruby. The blast door is
just being lowered, revealing Picard. Geordi has
returned to the Phoenix cockpit. A console separates
Picard and Scrimm.

PICARD
What do you want?

SCRIMM
The invasion plans.

PICARD
Invasion.

SCRIMM
These people you're calling
"Vulcans"... who are they? Where
do they come from? How many
troops? What kind of weapons?

183   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       183

Geordi is working a tricorder furiously. We're not
sure what he's doing...

CUT TO:

184   EXT. SPACE - RIKER   BORG                                  184

As they tumble through the void of space, in a
desperate fight.

The Borg manages to get his hand around Riker's
throat... begins choking him... Riker looks like a
goner... Suddenly they are both enveloped in a BRIGHT
BEAM OF PULSING ENERGY.

185   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE                                   185

Troi in command.

ENSIGN
(off console)
Tractor beam engaged. We've
got 'em, Commander.

TROI
Prismify the beam. Get rid of
that Borg.

186   EXT. SPACE - RIKER   BORG                                  186

As the tractor beam from the Enterprise SPLITS in two
and separates Riker from the Borg. The second beam
disappears, throwing the Borg off into space, while
Riker is towed back toward the hull of the ship.

187   ON RIKER                                                   187

As the beam moves him back toward the ship.

188   RIKER'S POV                                                188

A dizzying view of the stars and the Earth as he is
pulled through space.

189   RIKER                                                      189

Closes his eyes, fighting off waves of nausea.

RIKER
(to himself)
Don't look at the stars... don't
look at the stars...

CUT TO:

190   INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTROL ROOM                           190

Picard still stalling for time.

PICARD
(firm)
There is no invasion...

SCRIMM
Wrong answer, Mister Picard. Try
again.

He shoves his gun against Ruby's head. The tension
rises a notch.

PICARD
All right. You want the truth...
(beat)
The Vulcans... are highly
intelligent aliens.

191   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       191

Geordi working the tricorder... he can hear their
conversation in the other room through an open com
channel...

SCRIMM'S COM VOICE
Aliens... that's what I thought.
From where... Canada?

The tricorder BEEPS and he smiles...

192   INT. CONTROL ROOM                                          192

As before.

PICARD
From another planet.
(beat)
Oh, I almost forgot... they
have green blood and pointed ears.

SCRIMM
(skeptical)
And you know all this... because
you're a space-man too...

PICARD
I'm afraid you've caught me. I am
a space-man.

Scrimm smirks at him -- what gall this guy has. But
Ruby seems to discern some deeper meaning in Picard's
words. She frowns in puzzlement.

RUBY
(quiet)
Truth... he's telling the truth...

Picard looks at Ruby, and at that moment something on
a console behind her catches his eye: a LIGHT on
Beverly's SURGICAL TRANSPORTER is now FLASHING. No one
else notices.

SCRIMM
You're an entertaining man, Mister
Picard. But you're also full of
shit.

Scrimm cocks back the hammer on the pistol he's holding
to Ruby's head. The following happens very quickly:

-- Picard reaches out his hand, trying to stop Scrimm.

PICARD
Now, Geordi!

-- The gun in Scrimm's hand DEMATERIALIZES. Scrimm
reacts in shock.

-- Instantly, the gun REMATERIALIZES in Picard's
outstretched hand. He quickly pushes the barrel to
Scrimm's forehead.

PICARD
Actually, you're full of shit.

Everyone is in the room stunned by what's happened.
Picard takes charge before anyone can recover.

PICARD
(continuing)
Now, tell your men to drop their
weapons.

There's a beat, but then Scrimm sees he has little
choice.

SCRIMM
Weapons... down.

The other militia soldiers drop their weapons, which
are quickly picked up by Beverly and a Starfleet N.D.
Picard hands his gun to Lange, who covers Scrimm with
it.

Ruby turns to Picard.

PICARD
Are you all --

Ruby throws her arms around him and pulls him close.
He hugs her back, grateful she's alive. Ruby pulls
away.

RUBY
I think you have a plane to catch.

Picard smiles and heads back toward the Phoenix...

CUT TO:

193   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE - THE HULL                         193

Riker slams into the hull and the BEAM goes OFF. He
gets his bearings quickly and then RUNS toward the
torpedo tube where Worf and his few remaining men are
still fighting the Borg, who are about to overrun their
position.

194   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE                                   194

As before.

COMPUTER VOICE

Geordi and Picard strapping themselves back in...

196   EXT. SPACE - RIKER                                         196

reaches the torpedo tube, pulls up the firing control
mechanism, which shows a monitor screen with a cross-
hair targeting display. He activates the monitor,
which begins tracking over toward the deflector dish.

197   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE                                   197

COMPUTER VOICE
Nine... eight... seven...

198   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       198

Picard and Geordi's hands are flying across the
controls...

199   EXT. SPACE - RIKER                                         199

clamps a conduit into a power junction... then grabs
hold of a rotating lever inside the tube and TURNS it.
He ducks out of the way as the torpedo is LAUNCHED with
a ROAR.

200   WIDER                                                      200

As the torpedo streaks out from the saucer section and
slams into the deflector dish. The dish EXPLODES in a
burst of FLAME... blowing away the Borg who were
working on it...

201   INT. MISSSILE SILO - PHOENIX ENGINES                       201

As they IGNITE and start pouring out sheets of FLAME.

202   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       202

which is shuddering and shaking...

203   EXT. SPACE - RIKER   WORF                                  203

React with smiles. They did it.

204   INT. BRIDGE                                                204

Troi and the other N.D.s react with relief. The
countdown on the monitors are stopped at 00:03.

205   EXT. MONTANA - MISSILE SILO - WIDE SHOT - DAY              205

as the concrete missile doors slide open and the
Phoenix is LAUNCHED up into the sky, riding a pillar of
fire and smoke. This is our first real look at the
ship and it resembles an oversized ICBM with a
specialized cockpit on top.

206   INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTROL ROOM                           206

Lange and the other N.D.s have the militia soldiers
under guard. Ruby is watching the missile launch on a
video monitor. She smiles.

207   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       207

Picard and Geordi working the controls as the ship
bounces and shakes.

The g-forces push them back into their seats.

GEORDI
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five
thousand kilograms...

PICARD
Altitude fifty kilometers...

GEORDI
Entering the upper ionospere...

PICARD
There's a red light on the second
intake valve.

GEORDI
Ignore it. We'll be fine.
(beat)
Prepare for first stage shut-down
and separation on my mark...

208   EXT. SPACE - EARTH ORBIT                                   208

As the Phoenix rockets into space...

209   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       209

As before.

GEORDI
Three... two... one... mark!

210   EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX                                   210

The rocket booster SHUTS DOWN as the ship leaves
Earth's orbit and coasts on its momentum. After a
beat, the first stage booster separates from the ship
and DROPS AWAY, leaving three-quarters of the ship in
space.

211   INT. BORG HIVE                                             211

CLOSE ON DATA, head tilted back, eyes closed,
smiling...a few droplets of WATER fall from above onto
his face. He smiles wider, reveling in the sensation.

212   WIDER                                                      212

Data is still restrained on the table, but a conduit
has been placed above his head and is dripping
condensation onto his face. Data is now a completely
new being. His entire BODY is now made of HUMAN FLESH.
It's a shocking sight -- for anyone who ever wondered
what Data would look like human, we're now getting our
first look.

213   THE BORG QUEEN                                             213

DESCENDS from her nest in the ceiling. She watches
Data for a moment... rubs the moisture into his face.

BORG QUEEN
A Borg in all but name.

Data, although clearly enraptured with his new
sensations and feelings still struggles to maintain
his own sense of identity.

DATA
(weak)
I am... grateful for what you have
given me. But I still do not wish
to be assimilated.

BORG QUEEN
A universe of sensation is waiting
for you... don't you want to
explore it... with me?

To his surprise, Data finds that he is becoming drawn
to this strange creature and all that she can offer
him.

DATA
Yes...

BORG QUEEN
Then take the final step... give
me the Enterprise... and we can be
together... always.

He struggles, but ultimately there's only one answer.

DATA
No... I cannot.

Without taking her eyes away from Data, she reaches out
a hand and touches a control on a nearby console. The
color of Data's FACE turns an ASHEN GRAY --  as though
the blood has drained from his skin. Another droplet
of moisture falls and hits him on the cheek -- but this
time his eyes widen in shock.

The sensation of human feeling is gone.

BORG QUEEN
I've deactivated the sensory
inputs. That flesh on your body
is just meat, now.

DATA
No... no, please... you cannot...

She moves in close on him, an edge creeping into her
voice:

BORG QUEEN
You must give me what I want...
now. Without the deflector dish,
we can no longer send for an early
invasion. We must assimilate
Earth ourselves. I need this
ship.

She hits the control, and the COLOR returns to his
face. Data gasps -- filled with feeling once again.
The Borg Queen runs her hand across his cheek -- her
attitude seductive and affectionate once again.

BORG QUEEN
Isn't it better like this...?

DATA
Yes... but the Enterprise... my
duty...

BORG QUEEN
... is to yourself. Don't make me
hurt you again...

She touches the control again. Data is shocked back
into his cold, android self. He's like a heroin addict
being denied his "high" with the flick of a switch.

DATA
No... no, it's so... empty...
please... give it back... I need
it...

BORG QUEEN
And I need to control this ship.
Let me into your mind.

Data struggles, anguished... we've never seen him like
this before... completely beaten down... finally, he
nods. The Borg Queen touches the control again. A
sharp intake of breath as the feeling returns to Data.
And the Queen kisses him on the mouth.

This time, he responds eagerly, throwing himself into
the emotion of the moment. She pulls back a little,
looks at him softly, passionately. Data stares back at
her, breathless -- he seems to be completely in her
thrall.

DATA
In order to access my neural
net... you will need to create a
positronic interface.
(beat)
I will tell you how.

OFF the Borg Queen's smile of victory...

CUT TO:

214   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       214

As before. Picard and Geordi work the control in
silence for a few moments. The ship is floating in
space, now a good distance from Earth.

GEORDI
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.

PICARD
As they used to say... all systems
are go.

Geordi works his console...

215   EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX                                   215

Two fifty-foot long sheets of metal fall away from the
ship on either side of the Phoenix, revealing primitive
WARP NACELLES tucked inside the craft. The warp
nacelles then begin slowly extending themselves outward
on either side -- the basic designs of the nacelles
should be familiar to anyone who's ever seen a STAR
TREK starship.

This is the beginning of a long-standing architectural
design element of our ships.

216   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       216

As before.

GEORDI
The Vulcans should be out there
right now. We need to break the
warp barrier in the next five
minutes if we're going to get
their attention.

PICARD
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll
lay in a heading.

GEORDI
The nacelles are charged...
nuclear warhead standing by.
We're ready to ignite the warp
drive.

PICARD
Engage.

217   EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX                                   217

The warp nacelles FLARE with power and the ship begins
moving forward in space.

218   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       218

They're SLAMMED BACK into their seats from the massive
G-forces.

GEORDI
Warp field looks good...
structural integrity holding...

Picard activates a monitor which begins showing a
digital display of their speed.

PICARD
(off monitor)
Speed... twenty thousand
kilometers per second.

219   EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX                                   219

The ship is going faster... faster...

220   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE                                   220

Troi is standing outside the emergency airlock with the
Ensign, who is working the wall panel.

The airlock door OPENS after a beat, and Riker, Worf
and One Security Guard ENTER. They're exhausted after
the pitched battle. Troi smiles at them as they remove
their helmets.

TROI
I have to admit there was a moment
there when --

RIKER
(holds up a hand)
Hold that thought.

He turns away and then doubles over behind a console
and begins vomiting off screen. Worf shrugs.

WORF
Strong heart. Weak stomach.

A light beat, and then suddenly the entire Bridge GOES
DARK -- ALL POWER GONE. Console, monitors, everything.

RIKER
Report!

WORF
We've lost Bridge control!

RIKER
Emergency override!

WORF
(works)
Nothing.

221   INT. BORG HIVE                                             221

The Borg Queen is floating in the middle of the room,
surrounded by Borg consoles and technology. Data is
still on the table, with some kind of specialized
conduit connecting his head to a group of monitors,
which are inactive at the moment. He appears to be
caught up in the rapture of his new sensations, and his
personal connection to the Borg Queen. All thought of
his Starfleet responsibilities are gone.

DATA
(to Queen)
I am re-routing Bridge command
functions to this location.

Data thinks for a moment, and the monitors suddenly
COME TO LIFE and the equipment around the Queen HUMS
with POWER.

Information about critical Enterprise systems flows
across the monitor screens -- we might recognize
graphics from the Bridge displays. The Borg are now in
control.

BORG QUEEN
Eliminate their remaining
defenses. I will send Borg to
assimilate the rest of the crew.

Data nods... but then one of the consoles BEEPS.

DATA
(reacts)
There is a perimeter alert. A
ship has entered sensor range.

BORG QUEEN
Vulcan?

DATA
No.

Data tilts his head and --

222   A MONITOR                                                  222

shows an exterior space shot. The image rapidly ZOOMS
IN on the distant PHOENIX. The ship is racing through
space.

BORG QUEEN
(reacts, to Data)
Give me helm control.

Data nods. Another console lights up. She moves to
work it herself...

223   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE                                223

As the ship turns and begins moving off at impulse
speed.

224   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       224

As before, Picard is now steering the ship with a 21st
century JOYSTICK CONTROL. The ship is moving faster
and faster, trembling now, a ROAR building.

PICARD
Passing one-half light speed. The
starboard nacelle's running a
little hot...

GEORDI
I'm on it...

The CABIN shakes a little.

GEORDI
The inertial dampers are having
trouble compensating... I don't
think Cochrane built this thing
for comfort.

PICARD
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five
thousand kilometers per second.

WHOOSH! A weird DISTORTION passes through the cabin
like a wave, then vanishes.

GEORDI
There's no temporal shielding in
here! We're starting to pick up
relativistic effects!

PICARD
One minute to warp threshold...

225   EXT. SPACE                                                 225

The warp ship WHIPS by... and then a moment later, the
ENTERPRISE ROARS into view, chasing the tiny ship.

226   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       226

Geordi glances out the window... does a double-take and
looks back up in surprise...

GEORDI
Captain, the Enterprise!

PICARD
(taps combadge)
Picard to Enterprise.
(beat)
Picard to Enterprise -- do you
read me?

No response.

PICARD
Their com system must still be
down.

GEORDI
Well, I feel a whole lot better
with them out there. We may need
some help.

227   INT. BORG HIVE                                             227

As before, the Queen floating above the helm control
console. The warp ship is on the monitor, getting
closer.

DATA
I have repaired the weapons array.
Phasers are on-line.

A floating CROSSHAIR appears on the monitor showing the
warp ship. The Queen works the console. The crosshair
moves, but refuses to lock onto the warp ship. She
frowns.

BORG QUEEN
The targeting lock isn't working.

Data looks puzzled.

DATA
I do not understand. The optical
data network has been repaired,
and all systems are functioning.

The Queen works furiously, still can't get the
crosshairs to lock onto the ship.

BORG QUEEN
Your diagnostics are in error. I
need weapons.

DATA
(thinks)
The problem must lie in the
interface between Starfleet and
Borg technology. Your console may
not be configured to handle the
data flow.

BORG QUEEN
Can you configure it?

DATA
I believe so.

BORG QUEEN
Do it.

She hits a series of Borg controls on a nearby
console... and the restraints holding Data to the table
are RELEASED. Two Borg drones move to him... as he
stands up and heads for the Queen, the specialized
cable still attached to his head...

228   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE                                228

closing in on the tiny warp ship. It's like a shark
chasing a guppy.

229   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       229

Ship SHAKING with power and acceleration.

PICARD
Approaching light speed...

Geordi glances out a side window.

GEORDI
They're getting awfully close...
what the hell are they doing?

PICARD
We're crossing the threshold!

The ship is really SHAKING HARD now -- and the
compartment is DISTORTING slightly, stretching,
everything becoming elongated...

230   EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX                                   230

The ship is STRETCHING in the familiar "rubber band
effect" that tells us a ship is going into warp... but
this effect is much slower. It's on the verge of
hitting warp speed. The Enterprise still on their
tail.

231   INT. BORG HIVE                                             231

Data is standing right next to the Queen, and is
studying the Borg console intently. Two Borg drones
stand nearby, watching closely.

DATA
I believe I see the problem.

In the blink of an eye:

-- DATA WHIRLS AROUND AND SLAMS AN ARM INTO ONE OF THE
BORG DRONES. The drone is knocked off its feet.

-- The second Borg rushes at Data, swings his arm at
Data's head. This is the same Borg with the deadly
stiletto-tipped DRILL SPIKES seen earlier. The spikes
TEAR into the flesh of Data's neck, drawing BLOOD.

-- Data reacts in pain. He GRABS the Borg's arm and
with android strength KICKS HIM IN THE CHEST at the
same time. The Borg FLIES BACKWARD, causing the
cybernetic ARM to RIP from its socket in a shower of
sparks.

-- The Borg Queen SWOOPS down at Data for the kill.
But Data's too quick for her. With one swift motion,
he turns and THROWS the BORG ARM like a JAVELIN across
the room.

232   NEW ANGLE                                                  232

As the spikes on the severed Borg arm PUNCTURE one of
the diathermic oxygen tanks seen earlier. A HUGE
EXPLOSION of DEADLY GAS bursts out of the ruptured
tank. The WALL of roiling gas sweeps through the
entire Borg Hive.

BORG QUEEN
(screams)
No!

She lunges at Data just as the gas envelopes them!

233   EXT. SPACE - THE PHOENIX                                   233

As it GOES INTO WARP -- it shoots forward and streaks
away from the Enterprise!

234   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       234

As Picard and Geordi are slammed back into their seats
and the stars WHIP PAST the windows in the familiar
warp effect.

235   INT. BORG HIVE                                             235

Data and the Borg Queen tearing and clawing at each
other amongst the spewing gas. The Borg drones try to
get away, but they are SWALLOWED by the rush of gas,
fall to the deck, twitching in pain.

Data and the Borg Queen both fall to the deck,
grappling with each other.

236   EXT. SPACE - THE WARP SHIP                                 236

As it STREAKS PAST -- the warp ship flying at top
speed.

237   INT. BORG HIVE                                             237

Data and the Borg Queen struggling against each
other... the gas swirling around their bodies... and as
it does, we see the FLESH on their bodies start to
LIQUEFY and MELT AWAY in a horrific ooze of blood and
skin.

238   INT. PHOENIX COCKPIT                                       238

As before, but the ride has smoothed out considerably,
Warp stars streaking by.

PICARD
Bring us about...

A beat as Geordi works.

GEORDI
Dropping out of warp.

Out the front windows, the warp stars STOP... the ship
JOLTS slightly... turns to the left... Earth can be
seen in the distance.

They smile. It's a moment of victory.

PICARD
Let's begin the landing procedure.

239   INT. CARGO BAY BORG HIVE                                   239

The onrush of gas is gone. But it has affected every
surface of the room like an acid wash. Every piece of
Borg machinery is smoking and hissing. The two Borg
drones are lying on the floor, dead -- all organic
matter and flesh have been dissolved from their bodies,
leaving only raw mechanical skeletons.

MOVE TO REVEAL:

240   DATA AND THE BORG QUEEN                                    240

lying on the floor, still locked together. Data is a
shocking image: all of his human flesh has been
STRIPPED AWAY, leaving only his pure android self. His
metallic skull gleams in the dim light... even his eyes
are gone. His mechanical left arm is still intact, but
the right human arm is completely gone. His torso is
stripped of the human flesh, leaving pure android with
no soft human touches. Data as we've never seen him
before -- raw and mechanistic.

Data rolls over... still locked around him is the
MECHANICAL SKELETON of the Borg Queen. A metallic
spinal column with two arms with clawed hands leading
off it... and a blinking, electronic BRAIN STEM at the
very top of the spine.

Data throws off the grotesque form. The Borg Queen
carcass writhes and claws at the air. She speaks in a
flat, mechanical voice.

BORG QUEEN
(fritzed)
Data...

Data reaches out with one hand... grabs the metal
spinal column just below the brain stem... and SNAPS IT
IN TWO. The blinking brain stem FRITZES OUT.

241   INT. CORRIDOR                                              241

Two Borg Drones moving down the hall suddenly stop...
twitch... the blinkies on their bodies GO OUT... and
they both FALL OVER DEAD. Their connection to their
Queen severed.

242   INT. JEFFERIES TUBE                                        242

Another Borg Drone reacts... lights out... slumps over
DEAD.

243   INT. BORG HIVE                                             243

Data releases the remains of the dead Borg Queen. He
leans back a little, as though exhausted by his
remarkable experience. CAMERA PULLS BACK, emphasizing
the loneliness of this smoking, scorched android
sitting alone in the ruins of the Borg Hive...

CUT TO:

244   EXT. MISSILE SILO - DAY                                    244

The missile doors now open, the ground badly scorched
from the launch. Scrimm and his militia guards are
sitting on the ground, while Lange and the other
Starfleet N.D. keep a watchful eye on them. Cochrane
is sitting against a rock, while Beverly checks him
over. Ruby is pacing, lost in thought...

PICARD'S VOICE
Isn't anyone going to say welcome
back?

Everyone looks up to see --

245   PICARD AND GEORDI                                          245

standing a few feet away, tired but triumphant.

BEVERLY
Did it work?

Picard nods. Beverly, Lange and the N.D. look
relieved. Ruby takes a few steps toward Picard.

246   COCHRANE                                                   246

smiles up at Geordi.

COCHRANE
Mister La Forge... now I'd like to
shake your hand.

Geordi smiles and walks over to him.

247   PICARD AND RUBY                                            247

stop a few feet away from each other, their eyes
locked. They drink in sight of each other...
there's an undercurrent of unspoken feelings and words.
She smiles... he smiles back. A satisfying moment.

PICARD (V.O.)
Captain's log, March 3rd, 2063.
The voyage of the Phoenix was a
success... again.

CUT TO:

248   EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - NIGHT                             248

Townspeople along the Main Street. A sense of
urgency -- something's going on.

PICARD (V.O.)
And it appears the Vulcan ship has
detected the warp signature and is
now on its way to Earth.

Suddenly something in the night sky catches their
attention. A BRIGHT LIGHT is moving down towards the
city. We now realize this is what people are reacting
to...

249   JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN                                       249

Just a hundred yards beyond the city limits we see the
massive VULCAN SCOUT SHIP SETTLING down onto the
ground. Dust flying everywhere. Windmill blades
spinning wildly from the exhaust.

250   THE TOWNSPEOPLE                                            250

squinting into the wind, trying to make out what's
happening...

251   NEW ANGLE - ON A HILLTOP                                   251

A good distance away, but with a good view of the
entire scene. Riker, Worf, Beverly, Troi and Geordi
watching from a distance as the Vulcan ship LANDS.

252   JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN                                       252

Picard, Ruby and a bandaged, but much healthier Zephram
Cochrane watching the landing. People from town are
surging around them. Everyone is shocked and amazed at
what they're seeing. Picard watches with satisfaction --
this is the moment he's been waiting for.

Cochrane and Ruby are particularly awestruck.

253   THE VULCAN SHIP                                            253

settles, engines whining down... dust settling.

254   PICARD                                                     254

moves to Cochrane, takes him gently by the arm.

PICARD
Doctor Cochrane... this is your
moment.

Cochrane looks a little bewildered, tries to grapple
with the moment.

COCHRANE
My God... they're really from
another world?

PICARD
That's right. And they're going
to want to meet the man who flew
that warp ship.

Cochrane looks at him.

COCHRANE
And that's supposed to be me...

PICARD
Zephram, you had the vision to
build that ship when no one else
on this planet could see beyond
their own problems.
(beat)
You flew that ship... all I did
was push a few buttons.

Cochrane looks at him for a moment... takes a breath,
nods...

COCHRANE
All right.
(beat)
And don't worry -- I'll keep your
secret.

They hear a mechanical WHIRR and a HISS of air.

255   NEW ANGLE                                                  255

as a HATCH opens on the Vulcan ship. The townspeople
behind them react with shock and fear... a few people
take a step back. Picard looks at Cochrane, who
hesitates for a moment... then finally takes a deep
breath... and strides out toward the alien ship. A man
alone about to change the course of human history.

Ruby moves closer to Picard and puts her arm around
him... and he puts his arm around her.

256   HILLTOP                                                    256

As the rest of our crew is enraptured by the moment...
they glance at each other with excitement as they watch
history unfold...

257   VULCAN SHIP                                                257

Cochrane stops a few feet away from the ship as the
hatch swings completely open... light streams out into
the night air... and THREE HOODED, ROBED FIGURES
EMERGE. They stand across from Cochrane -- a moment
frozen in time.

258   THE TOWNSPEOPLE                                            258

watching in awe...

259   PICARD AND RUBY                                            259

watching...

260   THE LEAD VULCAN                                            260

pulls his hood back, revealing the familiar slanted
eyebrows and pointed ears, holding himself with that
austere, regal dignity we've come to associate with his
race. He steps forward to greet Cochrane... raises his
hand as if to wave.

Cochrane raises his hand automatically, as if to wave
in return...

But then the Vulcan splits his fingers in the classic
Vulcan greeting.

VULCAN
Live Long and Prosper.

Cochrane tries to emulate the Vulcan hand-sign...but
can't quite do the awkward finger-split.

COCHRANE
Um... thanks.

The Vulcan cocks an eyebrow at him. The very first
Alien-Human relationship is underway...

261   PICARD AND RUBY                                            261

are now surrounded by townspeople, who are watching the
scene unfold...

262   HILLTOP                                                    262

Our heroes share a glance with each other and smile,
Riker taps his combadge.

RIKER
Riker to Enterprise. Five to beam
up.

The crew DEMATERIALIZES...

263   PICARD AND RUBY                                            263

have now moved away from the crowd... no one paying
attention to them. The bright lights from the Vulcan
ship cast them in a dramatic silhouette. Picard turns
to Ruby. It's the moment he's been dreading. This is
goodbye. She looks at him.

RUBY
You're leaving, aren't you?

PICARD
I have to...

RUBY
Where? And don't tell me San
Francisco...

PICARD
No. It's a lot further than that.

RUBY
It's the future, isn't it? Just
like you told Scrimm.
(beat)
I knew you weren't from around
here.

PICARD
(with humor)
No... I'm from France.

RUBY
I don't care if you're from France
or Venus... just take me with you.

PICARD
That's impossible.

RUBY
Why?

PICARD
This may be hard for you to
understand... but I'm duty-bound
not to interfere with you, or
anyone else here... any more than
is absolutely necessary.

RUBY
You've been interfering with my
life ever since I met you.
(with meaning)
Don't stop now.

Picard struggles... he doesn't want to do this, but
he's torn between his heart and his duty.

PICARD
Ruby... I'm sorry.
(remembering his words
to Beverly)
But our fates lie along different
paths.

A long, difficult moment... then he lets her go...
turns and starts walking off into the night. She
stands where she is, watching him go with tears in her
eyes...

Picard hits his combadge.

PICARD
Picard to Enterprise. One to...

He stops where he is.

RIKER'S COM VOICE
Riker here. Captain, we didn't
get your whole transmission.

Picard turns, looks back at Ruby. Their eyes meet...
and he makes the decision.

PICARD
To hell with fate.

RIKER'S COM VOICE
Say again, Captain?

He starts walking towards her. She sees him coming...
starts running to him. She throws herself into his
arms and he holds her close. They kiss. A magical
moment, then...

PICARD
Enterprise. Two to beam up.

They DEMATERIALIZE holding each other tight...

264   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE                                264

moving out of Earth orbit...

265   INT. BRIDGE                                                265

Riker, Worf, Troi, N.D.s. Picard ENTERS with Ruby.
Everyone reacts to seeing her there. Ruby stays in the
Turbolift, staring around the Bridge in amazement.
Picard takes her hand and leads her out onto the
Bridge.

PICARD
How's Mister Data?

Riker glances at Ruby uneasily.

RIKER
He's in Sickbay. Doctor Crusher
says he can be repaired... but we
have to wait until we...

He glances at Ruby again, awkward. But Picard finishes
his thought.

PICARD
Return to our own time?

RIKER
Yes, sir.

PICARD
Then make it so. Have you
determined how to recreate the
temporal vortex?

Picard sits in his chair. Riker hesitates.

RIKER
Yes, sir. But Captain... are
we... all going back?

PICARD
Unless you'd like to stay.

RIKER
No, sir.

Ruby stands stock-still, staring at Worf. Worf looks
up at her with a Klingon smile -- teeth and all.

Ruby manages a weak smile in return, then moves off to
stand next to Picard.

RIKER
Bridge to Engineering. Mister La
Forge... initiate the temporal
vortex.

266   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE                                266

moving through space... and then the TEMPORAL VORTEX
forms directly ahead of it, as seen before. The ship
ENTERS the vortex...

267   EXT. SPACE - THE 24TH CENTURY                              267

The Enterprise EXITS the VORTEX and into Earth orbit.

268   INT. BRIDGE                                                268

As before.

WORF
Incoming transmission from
Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.

PICARD
Onscreen.

269   INCLUDE VIEWER                                             269

Admiral Hayes appears.

PICARD
Admiral... what's the status of
the Borg fleet?

ADMIRAL HAYES
It's been destroyed. The Borg
threat is over.
(beat)
Are you all right? The Enterprise
disappeared from our sensors for
a moment.

PICARD
We're fine, sir. It will take
some... time to explain.

ADMIRAL HAYES
I look forward to reading your
report.

The transmission ends. Ruby turns to Picard with
amazement.

RUBY
That makes two of us.

Picard gives her a gentle smile. OFF the moment...

CUT TO:

270   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE                                270

The great ship entering a Starfleet SPACE DOCK.

271   INT. BORG HIVE ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL ROOM                   271

Geordi is directing a work crew of a dozen engineers,
as they clean up the room and repair the damage.

GEORDI
(to a couple of N.D.s)
No, no -- we'll have to rip out
this entire bulkhead. We'll need
new bracing members for the deck
above and below.

The N.D.s move off, making notes on their PADDS.
Geordi turns and sees Data standing in the doorway.
He's now been fully restored to his original android
self.

GEORDI
Data...

Geordi moves to him, puts a hand on his shoulder.

GEORDI
You look good as new.

DATA
You could say that I'm back to my
old self.

GEORDI
That's great.

Geordi's smile fades a little as Data walks into the
room.

DATA
Her remains... are they still
here?

Geordi points over to a corner, where some N.D.s are
about to close a storage container. Data walks over.
Geordi goes with him. The N.D.s move aside, and Data
looks down into the storage container. The broken,
mangles pieces of machinery are all that's left of the
Borg Queen.

GEORDI
I'm sending them to the Daystrom
Institute for analysis.

Data stares down at the remains with a haunted look.

DATA
I never realized how powerful an
emotion temptation could be.

GEORDI
Temptation? You said in your
report it was all a ruse... you
were manipulating her.

A quiet beat.

DATA
She was... a unique lifeform. In
her own way... nearly perfect.

Geordi smiles a little.

GEORDI
(joking)
It almost sounds like you miss
her.

Data looks up at him -- his expression unreadable.
Geordi's smile fades. Data reaches out, closes the lid
on the storage container, turns and walks out of the
room. Geordi watches him go, left to wonder what Data
is really feeling.

CUT TO:

272   EXT. MONTANA - HILLTOP - DAY                               272

Picard and Ruby walk up the familiar hilltop, and when
they reach the crest, we reveal...

273   A MOMENT                                                   273

A large memorial cordoned off by a chain. A PLAQUE on
the monument reads "On this spot, Man and Vulcan met
for the first time... and changed the course of
history. March 3rd, 2063."

274   PICARD AND RUBY                                            274

step into view. They stare at the sculpture for a
moment.

PICARD
Welcome home.

275   WIDE SHOT                                                  275

Picard, Ruby and the monument are at the gates of
RESURRECTION CITY as it is in the 23rd century. This
is the place where man first reached out to the stars,
and the architecture has a distinctive uplifting
feeling -- spires reaching up toward the sky.
Shuttlecraft and aircars are taking off and landing.
The tiny Western town is now a thriving, futuristic
METROPOLIS.

As Picard and Ruby walk towards the city hand-in-
hand...

FADE TO BLACK.

STAR WARS EPISODE 3: REVENGE OF THE SITH SCRIPT

George Lucas


1 EXT. SPACE

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the Main Title, followed by a rollup, which crawls into infinity.

War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith Lord, Count Dooku. There are heroes on both sides. Evil is everywhere.

In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General Grievous, has swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Galactic Senate.

As the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor. . . .

PAN DOWN to reveal a REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. Continue to PAN with the Cruiser as TWO JEDI STARFIGHTERS enter and head toward an enemy Battle Cruiser. TRUCK with the Jedi Fighters as they maneuver in unison, dodging flack and enemy laser fire. R2-D2 is on Anakin's ship. R4-P17 is on Obi-Wan's ship. A giant space battle is revealed as the tiny Jedi ships continue their assault in a synchronous ballet.

2 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

OBI-WAN bounces through the flack with a frown. His ship rocks violently.

3 INT. ANAKINS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

ANAKIN smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTER.

ANAKIN: There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . .

OBI-WAN: Look out, four droids inbound . . .

4 EXT. CORUSCANT-SPACE BATTLE

The TWO JEDI FIGHTERS swerve in unison as FOUR TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS attack. After several clever moves by the Jedi, two of the FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS collide with each other in a ball of flame.

5 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

OBI-WAN struggles to maintain control of his ship.

OBI-WAN: We've got to split them up.

ANAKIN: Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.

OBI-WAN flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER. The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow.

OBI-WAN: Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?

ANAKIN: Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.

OBI-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starship's superstructure, but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, they're all over me!

ANAKIN: Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . .

ARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANAKIN swoops in for the kill. ANAKIN BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES.

ANAKIN: (continuing, laughs) We got him, Artoo!

ANAKIN BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as ARTOO BEEPS an angry warning.

ANAKIN: I copy, Artoo.

OBI-WAN: I'm going down on the deck.

ANAKIN: Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver.

OBI-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS and is forced to fly through a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the surface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by ANAKIN.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!

ARTOO BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP FIGHTER.

OBI-WAN: Hurry up! I don't like this!

OBI-WAN flies through a narrow gap between two towers on a Battleship. The DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wan's wings with a laser blast, and parts of the ship go flying around Obi-Wan's Astro Droid, ARFOUR.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Ouch!

R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down.

ANAKIN: We're locked on ... we've got him . . .

ANAKIN drops in behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him apart. ARTOO SQUEALS with delight.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.

OBI-WAN: Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and get on with it ...

R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.

ANAKIN: Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead.

ARTOO BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in Anakin's cockpit.

ANAKIN: (continuing) The one crawling with vulture droids.

6 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

OBI-WAN: I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.

Ahead is a TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER with batlike DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS stalking around on the hull. The VULTURE FIGHTERS transform into flight configuration, lift off the CRUISER, and attack the JEDI STARFIGHTERS.

ANAKIN: Come on, Master.

OBI-WAN: Not this time. There's too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you copy?

ODD BALL: (OS) Copy, Red Leader.

OBI-WAN: Mark my position and form your squad up behind me . . .

7 INT. ODD BALL'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

ODD BALL: We're on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position.

The protective ray shield lowers on the main hangar of the TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER, and six new DROID TRI-FIGHTERS emerge and join the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS heading toward the Jedi. The JEDI STARFIGHTERS extend the stability foils on the ends of their wings.

8 INT. ANAKIN'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

ANAKIN: This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side.

ARTOO BEEPS a worried message.

OBI-WAN: Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . .

ANAKIN: I'm going head to head. See you.

OBI-WAN: Take it easy, Anakin.

Four Clone Fighters move into formation behind the Jedi.

ODD BALL: I'm on your right, Red Leader.

ANAKIN: Incoming!!

ARTOO SQUEALS as five DROID TRI-FIGHTERS pass by at high speed on the right.

OBI-WAN: Five more on the right!

Four more VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS pass at high speed from the left. All hell breaks loose. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue to fly in unison, backing up each other. ARTOO SQUEALS.

ANAKIN: Here we go.

The Jedi ships split up and make a quick loop around the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, ending up behind them. BLASTING away. The DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE.

OBI-WAN: I'm going high and right.

ANAKIN: Hang on. There are four more of them.

OBI-WAN: Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us.

ANAKIN: I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.

OBI-WAN: All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash.

In one incredible move, ANAKIN swings in behind the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, blowing them away one by one until there is only one left. ARTOO CHIRPS.

ARTOO lets out a HOWL as ANAKIN accelerates past the last DROID TRI-FIGHTER, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from the front. ARTOO BEEPS frantically as they fly through the debris of the destroyed ships. ANAKIN looks behind him.

ANAKIN: How many back there. Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three . . . (continuing) Four . . . that's not good.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, you have four on your tail.

ANAKIN: I know. I know!

OBI-WAN: Four more closing from your left.

ANAKIN: I know. I know!

OBI-WAN: Break right and go high.

ANAKIN: I'm going low and left.

Obi-Wan shakes his head.

OBI-WAN: (to himself) He still has much to learn.

ANAKIN swoops low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIP, dodging flack as ARTOO bounces along, trying to get out a sentence.

ANAKIN: Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . .

OBI-WAN: Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: "Survive."

ANAKIN: Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.

OBI-WAN drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing Anakin. ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN: Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left.

OBI-WAN fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE DROIDS, BLASTING four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench along the surface of one of the Trade Federation Battleships. He flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a small slit between two main struts.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) You'll never get through there, Anakin. It's too tight.

ARTOO BEEPS nervously.

ANAKIN: Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before.

OBI-WAN: Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow.

ARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal reads out, "WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT."

ANAKIN: Wrong thought, Artoo.

ANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH.

ANAKIN: (continuing) I'm through.

OBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into the EXPLOSION.
A CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space.
Finally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS.

ODD BALL: There are too many of them.

CLONE PILOT 2: I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . .

ANAKIN: I'm going to go help them out!

OBI-WAN: No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship!

Another CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them.

ANAKIN: Missiles! Pull up!

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN break right and left, and the missiles follow them. ANAKIN does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EXPLODE. Two missiles continue to chase OBI-WAN. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot.

OBI-WAN: They overshot us . . .

The second missile streaks next to Obi-Wan s Fighter and EXPLODES. Obi-Wan's ship rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them.

ANAKIN: They're coming around!

OBI-WAN: All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.

ANAKIN: Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters.

ANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide.

ANAKIN: We got 'em. Artoo!

Two missiles continue to track Obi-Wan.

OBI-WAN: Flying is for droids.

Suddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) I'm hit! Anakin?

ANAKIN: I see them . . . Buzz Droids.

The BUZZ DROIDS crawl across Obi-Wan's ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS break into the wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS goes after ARFOUR.

OBI-WAN: Arfour, be careful. You have one . . .

ARFOUR's head gets ripped off and flies away.

OBI-WAN: Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls.

ANAKIN: Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.

OBI-WAN: The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here.

ANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wan's left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi-Wan s Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ DROIDS, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan's ship.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) In the name of ...

ANAKIN: Steady . . . steady . . .

OBI-WAN: Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here.

ANAKIN: I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . .

OBI-WAN: Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin.

ANAKIN: Move to the right.

OBI-WAN: Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do.

ANAKIN: I'm not leaving without you, Master.

ANAKIN moves his ship next to OBI-WAN's and tries to physically knock the BUZZ DROIDS off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-WAN's ship in the process. One of the BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan's ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedi's view.

ANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls out onto Anakin's ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights the BUZZ DROID.

OBI-WAN: Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone.

ANAKIN: Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out!

OBI-WAN: Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye.

ARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship.

ANAKIN: Yeah, you got him!

OBI-WAN: Great, Artoo.

ANAKIN: Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.

OBI-WAN: Have you noticed the shields are still up?

ANAKIN: Oh?!? Sorry, Master.

ANAKIN streaks ahead of OBI-WAN's disintegrating Jedi Fighter and blasts the shield generator. It SPARKS and EXPLODES.

OBI-WAN: Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.

9 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The shield door drops away, and OBI-WAN crashes on the deck of the hangar bay, engulfed in a FANTAIL OF SPARKS. A set of blast doors starts SLAMMING shut across the hangar opening, as material is sucked into space.

ANAKIN maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast doors SLAM shut.
OBI-WAN ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit. He jumps dear just as his ship EXPLODES. BATTLE DROIDS rush at him from all directions.

ANAKIN jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the BATTLE DROIDS to where OBI-WAN is fighting. ARTOO pops out of the ship and follows ANAKIN.

OBI-WAN: Artoo, locate the Chancellor.

ANAKIN: Tap into the ship's computers.

They cut down the last of the droids and follow ARTOO over to a computer wall socket. The two JEDI fight off FOUR MORE DROIDS as ARTOO tries to find the Chancellor. Finally, a HOLOGRAM of the Trade Federation ship appears.

OBI-WAN: The Chancellor's signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.

ANAKIN: I sense Count Dooku . . .

OBI-WAN: I sense a trap.

ANAKIN: Next move?

OBI-WAN: Spring the trap.

The JEDI start to leave; ARTOO follows. The JEDI stop and turn to ARTOO.

ANAKIN: Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.

OBI-WAN: Here, take this, and wait for orders.

OBI-WAN tosses the comlink to ARTOO.

10 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

GENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the bridge of the TRADE FEDERATION cruiser followed by his TWO BODYGUARDS. He walks to the front of the bridge and stands in front of the NEIMOIDIAN CAPTAIN.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: What's the situation, Captain?

CAPTAIN: TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Just as Count Dooku predicted.

11 INT. HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN head for the elevator. A door opens in the hallway and two of GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS confront the JEDI.

BODYGUARD I: General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We've been waiting for you.

OBI-WAN: We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him.

As a dozen more droids join the group, the JEDI ignite their lightsabers and stand back-to-back.

OBI-WAN: Anakin. . .

ANAKIN: Ready.

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in the floor.

12 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO JEDI cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. Huge EXPLOSIONS outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. The Jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. ANAKIN dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it.

OBI-WAN: . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting.

ANAKIN: Well then, we're safe for the time being.

OBI-WAN: Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.

They run, EXPLOSIONS rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER BATTLE DROIDS drop into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING ECHO throughout the hallway. They pass several large power generators, which are topped with SPARKING excess power dischargers.

ANAKIN: They're sealing this section off.

OBI-WAN: Six droids coming our way!

The last of the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING in the distance.

ANAKIN: Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.

They move along a wall. ANAKIN climbs up the side to a small vent. The fuel gets closer to the SPARKING dischargers.

OBI-WAN: We'll never get through that. It's too small!

They move toward a second vent. OBI-WAN is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. ANAKIN feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. He closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-WAN is forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. It pulls the Jedi under the fuel. Just before he is about to drown, OBI-WAN disables the SUPER BATTLE DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe.

The fuel is up to the Jedi's chins. ANAKIN finds a very, very small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose.

ANAKIN: I found our escape vent.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here.

ANAKIN: Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . .

ANAKIN grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping a large panel loose revealing a "man-sized" work shaft. They scramble through it as the DROIDS swim closer.

13 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO JEDI pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until they reach a small hatch in the side of the tube.

ANAKIN: Here's a way out.

As the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the JEDI work the keyboard on the pressure lock, opening the latch.

14 INT. SMALL PASSAGEWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO JEDI climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch shut. They make their way through the ever-shrinking shaft until they reach the end.

15 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

A hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the Trade Federation Cruiser, and the JEDI squeeze out, SLAMMING the hatch. Behind them, ANAKIN seals the hatch with his laser sword.

OBI-WAN: That won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.

ANAKIN: The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized.

OBI-WAN: You still have much to learn, Anakin.

16 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS climb up the vent shaft. SUPER BATTLE DROID R77 and SEVERAL OTHER DROIDS wait in the generator room as the fuel continues to rise toward the power discharger.

SUPER BATTLE DROID R77: I have a bad feeling about this.

17 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The fuel hits the SPARKING power discharger, and there is a HUGE EXPLOSION.

18 EXT. TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-BATTLE

A GREAT EXPLOSION and a flaming gas cloud spray out of the side of the Federation Cruiser.

19 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

A large bulge appears in the wall around the sealed hatch as the EXPLOSION hits. OBI-WAN jumps back, then stands amazed.

OBI-WAN: All right, you win. I have much to learn. Let's go!

ANAKIN grins at OBI-WAN, and they run down the hallway.

20 INT. WIDE HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The two JEDI wait for an elevator to arrive. They turn around and see they are face to face with THREE DESTROYER DROIDS. The DROIDS start blasting away. Anakin deflects the bolts. OBI-WAN frantically pushes the elevator button several more times.

ANAKIN: Destroyers!!

Finally the door opens, and they rush inside under a hail of laser bolts. The elevator door slides shut. The JEDI turn to see BATTLE DROIDS standing behind them.

BATTLE DROID: Drop your weapons! I said drop 'em.

The JEDI activate their light sabers and destroy all the BATTLE DROIDS.

21 INT HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

R2-D2 notices two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS entering the hangar. He moves and hides behind a Jedi Starfighter.

22 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The elevator begins to move and screeches to a stop.

OBI-WAN: Did you press the stop button?

ANAKIN: No, did you?

OBI-WAN: No!

ANAKIN: Well, there's more than one way out of here.

ANAKIN ignites his laser sword.

OBI-WAN: We don't want to get out, we want to get moving. Artoo . . . Artoo. Do you copy? Activate elevator . . . (looks at control panel) . . . 31174 . . .

ANAKIN cuts a hole in the elevator ceiling.

23 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS are inspecting the Jedi starfighters. They overhear Obi-Wan's voice over the comlink and are distracted.

SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: What's that?

SUPER BATTLE DROID 2: Get back to work. It's nothing.

24 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN: Artoo?

ANAKIN climbs through the hole in the ceiling of the elevator.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Always on the move.

OBI-WAN continues to talk on the comlink. Artoo quietly beeps a reply.

25 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO tries to muffle the comlink as the TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS try to figure out where the voices are coming from. ARTOO extends an arm and plugs into a computer interface.

OBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we gave you a job to do! Artoo.

26 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Suddenly, the elevator plummets down the shaft. ANAKIN quickly jumps and grabs onto the hallway entry door. He watches as the elevator recedes down the shaft and disappears. ANAKIN struggles to keep his grip on the closed door as SPARKING wires rain down on him.

27 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The elevator starts to descend rapidly.

OBI-WAN: Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be going up.

28 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Anakin struggles to hang on to the narrow edge of the elevator shaft. The door to the elevator shaft is pried open, and TWO BATTLE DROIDS appear in the doorway and look down at ANAKIN. They point their guns at him.

DROID 1: Hands up, Jedi! Don't move.

DROID 2: Roger, roger.

29 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS overhear OBI-WAN's comlink messages to ARTOO.

SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: There it is again.

OBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we need to be going up, not down.

30 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The elevator races down as OBI-WAN holds on.

OBI-WAN: Stop. Artoo! We need to go up! Stop, stop!

The elevator stops with a jolt. OBI-WAN falls to the floor.

31 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS see ARTOO and walk toward the little droid.

SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: Hey you!

ARTOO plugs into the interface again and the elevator shoots up.

32 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN stands up after having fallen in the elevator.

OBI-WAN: Now, that's better . . .

33 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO is held up by TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS, who chuckle as the little Astro Droid curses and swings at them.

SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: You stupid little astro droid!

34 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN looks down and sees the elevator heading toward him at a high rate of speed. He looks at the BATTLE DROIDS leaning over him with their guns pointed at him. He calculates for a moment, then gives himself a push and flips himself up into the elevator shaft.

Before ANAKIN can arc into a descent down the shaft, the elevator races up through the shaft, cutting the DROIDS in two. ANAKIN lands on the elevator and quickly drops back through the hole in the ceiling. OBI-WAN is startled and ignites his lightsaber.

OBI-WAN: Oh, it's you . . .

35 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO activates his oil hose and sprays the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip on the oil.

36 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN: What was that all about?

OBI-WAN: Well, Artoo has been . . .

ANAKIN: No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can.

OBI-WAN: Did I say anything?

ANAKIN: He's trying!

OBI-WAN: I didn't say anything!

37 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO ignites his arm rockets and shoots out of their grip, spraying them both with oil and setting them on fire. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip and slide until they fall, smoldering. ARTOO rolls away.

38 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTER'S-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The elevator door opens and the TWO JEDI carefully make their way into the main room of the General's Quarters.
At the far end sits SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move toward the CHANCELLOR.
As they get closer to PALPATINE, they see a very distressed look on the Chancellor's face.

OBI-WAN: (bows) Chancellor.

ANAKIN: Are you all right?

PALPATINE: (quietly) Count Dooku.

PALPATINE makes a small gesture with his hand. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN turn around. The elevator DOORS CAN BE HEARD OPENING AND CLOSING as COUNT DOOKU strides into the room. He is above the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The Jedi turn to see him. He looks down on the Jedi.

OBI-WAN: (quietly to Anakin) This time we will do it together.

ANAKIN: I was about to say that.

COUNT DOOKU jumps down to the main level.

PALPATINE: Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord.

OBI-WAN: Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers.

COUNT DOOKU: Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN move toward DOOKU.

OBI-WAN: You won't get away this time, Dooku.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN charge COUNT DOOKU. A great sword fight ensues.

COUNT DOOKU: I've been looking forward to this.

ANAKIN: My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.

COUNT DOOKU: Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.

DOOKU lunges at the JEDI and they fall back . . .

COUNT DOOKU: (continuing) Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable. You'll have to do better.

As the battle proceeds, OBI-WAN and COUNT DOOKU are tired. ANAKIN is stronger as he becomes angry. ANAKIN continues to drive the attack on DOOKU. COUNT DOOKU throws OBI-WAN back using the Force.
ANAKIN and COUNT DOOKU move up the stairs. As they reach the upper landing of the General's Quarters, ANAKIN leaps over COUNT DOOKU. OBI-WAN reaches the top of the stairs, destroying TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. COUNT DOOKU holds OBI-WAN in the air using the Force as he turns and kicks ANAKIN out of frame. OBI-WAN is choking.
ANAKIN hits the archway.
DOOKU sends OBI-WAN flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. COUNT DOOKU spins around again and, using the Force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto OBI-WAN. ANAKIN spins and kicks COUNT DOOKU, sending him over the balcony. ANAKIN Jumps, following him down to the main floor. COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN continue the fight.

COUNT DOOKU: (continuing) I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you don t use them.

Anakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT DOOKU as the Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting becomes even more intense.
Anakin attacks COUNT DOOKU with a new ferociousness.

39 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Anakin and Dooku continue their fight. It is intense! Finally, in one last energized charge, ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's hands. The Jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed Sith Lord's hand. COUNT DOOKU stumbles to the floor as ANAKIN puts the two lightsabers to his neck. PALPATINE is grinning as he watches COUNT DOOKU's defeat.

PALPATINE: Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!

ANAKIN: I shouldn't . . .

PALPATINE: Do it!!

ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's head. A huge EXPLOSION somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything.

ANAKIN: ... I couldn't stop myself.

PALPATINE: You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.

ANAKIN drops COUNT DOOKU's lightsaber, moving to PALPATINE.

ANAKIN: Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.

ANAKIN raises his hands toward PALPATINE, who is strapped in the Admiral's Chair. The Chancellor's restraints pop loose.

ANAKIN: (continuing) I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.

PALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists.

PALPATINE: It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.

The ship begins to list to one side. ANAKIN rushes over to OBI-WAN, lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. PALPATINE heads for the elevators.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late.

ANAKIN: He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right.

PALPATINE: Leave him, or we'll never make it.

ANAKIN: His fate will be the same as ours.

ANAKIN picks up OBI-WAN, slings him over his shoulder, and heads for the elevators.

40 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Prepare for attack.

PILOT: All batteries fire! Fire!

41 INT. BATTLESTATIONS-REPUBLIC CRUISER

Clone gunners fire on the Trade Federation cruiser and take fire in return. Gun emplacements are destroyed. Clone troopers go flying.

42 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN carries OBI-WAN to the elevator doors and hits the button. PALPATINE joins him.

ANAKIN: The elevator's not working, (into his comlink) Artoo . . .

ARTOO BEEPS a response to ANAKIN.

ANAKIN: (continuing) . . . Activate Elevator 3224.

Suddenly the ship shifts to its side as the elevator doors open. PALPATINE is thrown to the ground. ANAKIN jumps to the door frame of the elevator. ANAKIN looks into the elevator shaft.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in!

43 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Windows are blown out, droids and equipment are sucked into space.

PILOT: Reverse stabilizers.

44 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

As the ship rolls, spacecraft and equipment CRASH from one side of the ship to the other.
Several objects break through the metal blast doors, causing objects to be sucked into space. ARTOO starts to slide toward one of the small holes.

45 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

As the elevator shaft rotates, it has become a long hallway.
ANAKIN clings to the doorframe with OBI-WAN on his shoulder, as the Chancellor struggles to join him.

46 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO continues to skid and slide toward open space. He swerves around boxes and wrecked fighters. One of the BATTLE DROIDS stumbles and is consumed by the electronic shield in a zap. ARTOO BEEPS a reply as he dodges the laser blasts of the BATTLE DROIDS. One bolt hits very near him, and he SCREAMS in terror.

47 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

PILOT: Magnetize! Magnetize!

48 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO is about to be overtaken by a starfighter sliding behind him. He falls into a heap of broken battle droid parts and the fighter bounces over him.

49 EXT. SPACE-CORUSCANT

The TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER heads straight down toward the planet.

50 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN jumps into the horizontal elevator shaft with OBI-WAN still on his shoulder.

ANAKIN: We can't wait. Come on, we have to be fast.

PALPATINE climbs into the elevator shaft also. They start running. The ship begins to roll again, and the Jedi and the Chancellor are forced to jump from one side of the elevator to the other.

51 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Fire the emergency booster engines.

PILOT: Leveling out, sir.

52 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT ON SIDE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN still carrying OBI-WAN on his back, and PALPATINE run down the elevator shaft as it starts to move upright. ANAKIN cuts a control box on one of the doors, but before the doors can open, the ship moves to an angle, causing ANAKIN and PALPATINE to start sliding down the shaft. ANAKIN grabs some wires in the control box with one hand. PALPATINE grabs onto the Jedi's leg. As the ship rights itself, they are left hanging in the bottomless elevator shaft.

53 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT, VERTICAL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE hang precariously on the side of the bottomless elevator shaft. OBI-WAN regains consciousness and tries to look around.

ANAKIN: Easy. . . . We're in a bit of a situation.

OBI-WAN: Did I miss something?

OBI-WAN looks down and sees PALPATINE and the bottomless pit. They hear ARTOO BEEPING on Obi-Wan's comlink. The ship begins to roll, causing the vertical shaft to move into a forty-five-degree angle. They hear the elevator brakes release and look up to see the elevator heading toward them.

ANAKINN: Hold on.

OBI-WAN: What is that?

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up to watch the elevator approach them at high speed, then OBI-WAN turns to ANAKIN.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Oops.

ANAKIN: Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!

OBI-WAN: Too late! Jump!

They fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the ship catches up with them, and they hit the side of the shaft and slide at great speed just ahead of the elevator. The shaft continues to rotate until it is completely horizontal.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN take out and throw grappling hooks. The hooks catch and they continue to fall. All the doors in the elevator shaft open up, and the group swings through the open door into a hallway. The elevator roars by.

54 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE fly through the elevator door and land.

OBI-WAN: Let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable. Come on.

ANAKIN: Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?

55 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

As the Federation Cruiser continues to rotate, ARTOO SQUEALS and pokes a periscope out of a pile of broken BATTLE DROID PARTS. He looks around then rockets up out of the debris.

56 INT. HALLWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lead PALPATINE down a hallway toward the hangar bay.

57 INT. DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

It is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into space. The hangar bay doors are closed, but great stresses are being exerted as the ship twists, re-entering the atmosphere of Coruscant. They stop in a doorway leading into the hangar bay.

OBI-WAN: None of those ships will get us anywhere.

ANAKIN: I agree.

PALPATINE: What are we going to do?

ANAKIN: I don't know.

OBI-WAN: Don't look at me. I don't know.

ANAKIN and PALPATINE both look to OBI-WAN. He shrugs his shoulders. Anakin's Fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled. Suddenly, the ship turns on its side.

ANAKIN: Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.

OBI-WAN: We'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.

ANAKIN hands PALPATINE the end of a cable that is attached to his utility belt. PALPATINE attaches it around his waist. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN throw their utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes.

58 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now the wall. As he moves out into the hangar, TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS start firing at him. The Jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the DROIDS, blowing them up. ANAKIN and PALPATINE follow OBI-WAN along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. PALPATINE struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. PALPATINE loses his grip as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but ANAKIN manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the CHANCELLOR dangles on the other end of the utility cable. They are surrounded by SPARKS and EXPLOSIONS as the ship twists and tries to break apart. ANAKIN moves out of the steam and struggles to pull PALPATINE back to safety. ANAKIN is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. The ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, creating geysers of steam. Some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. They make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them.

59 INT. HANGAR DOORWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PALPATINE are out of breath.

ANAKIN OBI-WAN: Well, that was close.

They laugh.

60 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

BODYGUARD: General, we found the Jedi. They're in hallway 328.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Activate ray shields.

61 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

They run down the hallway. Suddenly, ray shields drop around them, putting them in an electronic box in the middle of the hallway.

ANAKIN: Ray shields!

OBI-WAN takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment.

OBI-WAN: Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this.

ANAKIN: Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.

OBI-WAN: Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault.

ANAKIN: You're the Master. I'm just a hero.

OBI-WAN: I'm open to suggestions here.

PALPATINE: Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release.

The Jedi look at each other in disbelief.

ANAKIN: I say . . . patience.

OBI-WAN: Patience! That's your plan, is it?

ANAKIN: Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . .

ARTOO comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. He takes a moment to compose himself.

ANAKIN: (continuing) See! No problem.

Suddenly several doorways open, revealing TWO DESTROYER DROIDS. SIXTEEN SUPER BATTLE DROIDS emerge from behind the DESTROYER DROIDS.
ARTOO turns and zaps one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS who then kicks ARTOO over.

SUPER BATTLE DROID: Don't move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.

OBI-WAN: Do you have a plan B?

62 EXT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN, ANAKIN PALPATINE, and ARTOO are captured by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. They stand before the ALIEN DROID GENERAL.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We've been waiting for you. That wasn't much of a rescue.

A BATTLE DROID walks to GENERAL GRIEVOUS and hands him the JEDI'S lightsabers.

OBI-WAN: That depends upon your point of view. Hah!

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.

ANAKIN: General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . .

OBI-WAN: Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.

OBI-WAN: Not this time. And this time you won't escape.

ANAKIN: Artoo.

ARTOO creates a distraction by extending all his arms, shooting out electrical pulses, and bouncing around.
OBI-WAN, hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around, reaches out and, using the Force, yanks his lightsaber out of the General's hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds. He continues to spin around and cuts Anakin free.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Crush them! Make them suffer!

ANAKIN uses the Force to yank his lightsaber out of the General's hand.

The DROIDS that surround them begin to FIRE. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump into the line of fire. The bridge degenerates into chaos. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN are locked in a pitched battle between electro staffs and laser swords with GENERAL GRIEVOUS's TWO BODYGUARDS.

CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is taken away by two BATTLE DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS walks around the bridge directing the BATTLE DROIDS.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay and watch your stations.

OBI-WAN fights one of General Grievous's BODYGUARDS. The BODYGUARD carries an electrified staff about five feet long. When the laser sword hits it, electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword. OBI-WAN is unable to cut the staff. The Jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge.
OBI-WAN pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off the DROID BODYGUARD'S head. The DROID BODYGUARD keeps attacking. ANAKIN struggles to defend himself against the other manic DROID BODYGUARD. He cuts the DROID BODYGUARD in half. TWO BATTLE DROIDS try to take the CHANCELLOR away.
ANAKIN follows them down the hallway and cuts them down, rescuing the Chancellor.
OBI-WAN finishes off the headless BODYGUARD. It crumbles to the floor in pieces.
ALARMS SOUND as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit. A PILOT yells at GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

PILOT: Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay on course . . . Don't bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN destroy the remaining DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS retrieves one of the BODYGUARD'S staffs and faces OBI-WAN. ANAKIN leaps over a console and lands behind GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: You lose, General Kenobi.

One of the PILOTS stands next to the General.

PILOT: The ship is breaking up!

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: We've run out of time.

OBI-WAN tries to get at GENERAL GRIEVOUS. ANAKIN runs at the General from the opposing side. GENERAL GRIEVOUS turns and throws his electrified staff at the window. It breaks, causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked into space. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is the first one sucked out into space. He fires a cable from his arm that attaches to the ship. He swings in and lands firmly on the side of the ship.
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, and PALPATINE hold on for dear life. A blast shield closes around where the window used to be.

63 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN continues to fight the BATTLE DROIDS. The DROIDS have backed him into a corner. OBI-WAN hides behind a control panel as the DROIDS blast away at him. He jumps up and over the DROIDS, cutting most of them down before he lands. He destroys the DROIDS and joins ANAKIN.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN cut through the rest of the DROIDS as if they were made of butter. PALPATINE stands in shock as he watches the carnage. Droid parts are firing everywhere. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stand back to back and cut down the last of the DROIDS just as there is a huge shudder, followed by more alarms. SPARKS begin to fly outside the windows.

PALPATINE: The hull is burning up!

64 EXT. HULL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE

GENERAL GRIEVOUS detaches his cable and crawls along the exterior hull of the Federation Cruiser, using his magnetized hands and feet. He reaches a row of escape pods and enters an airlock.

65 INT. POD BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE

GENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the escape pod bay through the hatch. The Droid General goes to a control panel and opens an escape pod.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Time to abandon ship.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls a row of switches, and one by one the escape pods are jettisoned.

66 INT. ESCAPE POD-SPACE

He gets in one, the hatch closes, and the escape pod blasts away from the damaged Cruiser.

67 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN go over to the navigator's chair.

ANAKIN: All the escape pods have been launched.

OBI-WAN: Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?

ANAKIN: You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?

ANAKIN sits in the pilot's chair and sees on a screen the back half of the ship break away. There is a great jolt, and the ship tilts forward.

OBI-WAN: Well?

ANAKIN: Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.

OBI-WAN and PALPATINE strap themselves into chairs. ANAKIN struggles with the controls of the ship. The ship starts to glow, and pieces break off. ARTOO moves in on Palpatine 's controls and assists in flying the cruiser.

OBI-WAN: Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.

ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN: Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.

OBI-WAN: Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . .

A large part of the ship breaks away.

ANAKIN: We lost something.

OBI-WAN: Not to worry, we're still flying half the ship.

ANAKIN: Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.

OBI-WAN: Careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .

ANAKIN: What's our speed?

OBI-WAN: Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we're in the atmosphere . . .

ANAKIN points to one of the controls. ARTOO beeps madly.

ANAKIN: Grab that . . . Keep us level.

OBI-WAN: Steady. Steady.

ANAKIN: Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.

OBI-WAN: Five thousand. Three thousand . . . two thousand. Fireships on the left and the right.

FlRESHIP PILOT: We'll take you in.

OBI-WAN: Copy that. Landing strip's straight ahead.

ANAKIN: We're coming in too hot.

OBI-WAN: Easy-easy.

The ship leaves a contrail as it streaks across the Coruscant skyline. PALPATINE and OBI-WAN hold on for dear life as the ship shakes and rattles toward an industrial landing platform.

68 EXT. CORUSCANT-INDUSTRIAL LANDING PLATFORM-AFTERNOON

A large landing platform in the industrial part of the city is surrounded by Emergency Fire Speeders. The smoking ship approaches as five Fireships spray it with foam. The ship finally makes a rather hard landing.

OBI-WAN: Another happy landing.

69 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON

The small Jedi Shuttle carrying PALPATINE and the JEDI arrives at the landing platform. There are a DOZEN SENATORS, including BAIL ORGANA, JAR JAR BINKS, and C-3PO, waiting for them. PALPATINE, R2-D2, and ANAKIN get out. OBI-WAN and MACE stay in the doorway of the Jedi Shuttle.

ANAKIN: (to Obi-Wan) Are you coming, Master?

OBI-WAN: Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.

ANAKIN: Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.

OBI-WAN: Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .

ANAKIN: All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.

OBI-WAN: . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.

ANAKIN: All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .

OBI-WAN: Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing.

ANAKIN smiles and walks away from OBI-WAN.
The CHANCELLOR and his entourage approach MACE.

MACE WlNDU: Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?

PALPATINE: Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.

MACE WlNDU: General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.

PALPATINE: That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.

MACE WlNDU: Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.

BAIL, ANAKIN, and the crowd walk away from the platform toward the Senate Building Grand Hallway.

BAIL ORGANA: Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.

ANAKIN and BAIL ORGANA, walking in the hallway.

ANAKIN: Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.

ARTOO and THREEPIO follow behind the crowd.

C-3PO: It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.

ARTOO beeps.

C-3PO: (continuing) Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

70 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON

ANAKIN is at the back of the crowd of SENATORS, talking with BAIL ORGANA. R2-D2 and C-3PO scoot along ahead of them.

BAIL ORGANA: The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures.

ANAKIN: I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.

Behind a row of large columns, a SHADOWY FIGURE follows the JEDI and the SENATOR. ANAKIN senses the figure.

BAIL ORGANA: I'll do everything I can with the Senate.

ANAKIN: Excuse me.

BAIL ORGANA: Certainly.

ANAKIN stops, and BAIL goes off after PALPATINE and the others. ANAKIN goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the SHADOWY FIGURE, who is revealed to be SENATOR PADME AMDALA. They embrace and kiss.

PADME: Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back.

ANAKIN: I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.

PADME: There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.

ANAKIN: I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.

ANAKIN starts to give her another kiss. She steps back.

PADME: Wait, not here . . .

He grabs her again.

ANAKIN: Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.

PADME: Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .

ANAKIN: I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you.

PADME: (playfully) I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.

ANAKIN embraces her, then looks at her.

ANAKIN: Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?

PADME: I'm just excited to see you.

ANAKIN: That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?

PADME: Nothing . . . nothing . . .

ANAKIN: You're frightened. (a little angry) Tell me what's going on!

PADME begins to cry.

PADME: You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .

ANAKIN: . . . Is there someone else?

PADME: (peeved, angry) No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.

ANAKIN: (sheepish) I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.

PADME: I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.

ANAKIN: It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .

PADME: Something wonderful has happened.

They look at each other for a long moment.

PADME: (continuing) I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant.

ANAKIN is stunned. He thinks through all of the ramifications of this. He takes her in his arms.

ANAKIN: That's . . . that's wonderful.

PADME: What are we going to do?

ANAKIN: We're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.

71 EXT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

A small NEIMOIDIAN SHUTTLE lands. BATTLE DROIDS surround the ramp as GENERAL GRIEVOUS descends onto the platform. SUPER BATTLE DROID G21 approaches.

SUPER BATTLE DROID G21: The planet is secure, sir. The population is under control.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Good. Where is the Separatist Council?

SUPER BATTLE DROID G21: This way, sir ...

GENERAL GRIEVOUS takes the elevator to an upper level. He enters a conference room and presses a series of buttons on the table, and bows.

72 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY

A hologram of Darth Sidious appears.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Yes, Lord Sidious.

DARTH SlDIOUS: General Grievous, I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: It will be done, My Lord.

DARTH SlDIOUS: The end of the war is near, General, and I promise you, victory is assured.

The hologram of Sidious talks to GRIEVOUS about the death of Count Dooku.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: But the loss of Count Dooku?

DARTH SlDIOUS: His death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than Lord Tyranus.

73 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-TWILIGHT

PADME stands in the balcony brushing her hair. ANAKIN leans against the wall, watching her lovingly.

ANAKIN: . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment.

PADME: Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.

ANAKIN: You are so beautiful!

PADME: It's only because I'm so in love . . .

ANAKIN: No, it's because I'm so in love with you.

PADME: So love has blinded you?

ANAKIN: Well, that's not exactly what I meant . . .

PADME: But it's probably true!

They laugh.

ANAKIN: I haven't laughed in so long . . .

PADME: Neither have I.

74 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM

The view is strangely distorted and disorienting. PADME is on a table in an alien medical chamber. She is giving birth and is screaming.

PADME: Anakin, help me! Help, Anakin! Anakin, I love you. I love you.

She screams and dies.

75 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-BEDROOM-NIGHT

ANAKIN awakens in a panic. He is covered in sweat. He looks over in the bed and sees PADME sound asleep next to him. ANAKIN gets out from under the sheets and sits on the side of the bed. He is breathing heavily. He puts his head in his hands and weeps. He regains his composure and leaves the room down a set of stairs. PADME awakens, realizes Anakin is gone.

PADME: Anakin??

She gets out of bed and goes downstairs to look for him.

76 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT

ANAKIN walks down a flight of stairs onto a large veranda. The vast city planet of Coruscant, smoldering from the battle, is spread out before him. He is distraught.
PADME descends the stairs and joins ANAKIN on the veranda. She takes his hand. He doesn't look at her.

PADME: What's bothering you?

ANAKIN: Nothing . . .

ANAKIN touches the japor snippet around PADME'S neck, that Anakin gave her when he was a small boy.

ANAKIN: (continuing) I remember when I gave this to you.

PADME: Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?

ANAKIN: It was a dream.

PADME: Bad?

ANAKIN: Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.

PADME: And?

ANAKIN: It was about you.

They look at each other. A moment of concern passes between them.

PADME: Tell me.

ANAKIN: It was only a dream.

PADME gives him a long, worried look. ANAKIN takes a deep breath.

ANAKIN: (continuing) You die in childbirth . . .

PADME: And the baby?

ANAKIN: I don't know.

PADME: It was only a dream.

ANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.

ANAKIN: . . . I won't let this one become real, Padme.

They embrace, then part.

PADME: Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.

ANAKIN: I know  .

PADME: Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?

ANAKIN: (suspicious) Have you told him anything?

PADME: No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.

ANAKIN: He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!

PADME: I won't, Anakin.

ANAKIN: I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.

77 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY

YODA and ANAKIN sit in Yoda 's room, deep in thought.

YODA: Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .

ANAKIN: They are of pain, suffering, death . . .

YODA: Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?

ANAKIN: Someone . . .

YODA: . . . close to you?

ANAKIN: Yes.

YODA: Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.

ANAKIN: I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.

YODA: Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.

ANAKIN: What must I do, Master Yoda?

YODA: Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.

78 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-DAY

ANAKIN hurries down a temple hallway, heading toward a Jedi Briefing Room. SEVERAL JEDI are exiting.

79 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY

ANAKIN rushes into the Briefing Room. By the time he reaches the Chamber, the last of the Jedi are leaving. Only OBI-WAN remains at the front of the lecture hall. He is shutting off some holograms and electronic charts and maps.

OBI-WAN: You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.

ANAKIN: I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.

OBI-WAN: In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

ANAKIN: What's wrong then?

OBI-WAN: The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.

ANAKIN: Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.

ANAKIN: Be careful of what?

OBI-WAN: He has requested your presence.

ANAKIN: What for?

OBI-WAN: He would not say.

ANAKIN: He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it?

OBI-WAN: All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.

ANAKIN: I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?

OBI-WAN: The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings.

80 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAY

ANAKIN stands with PALPATINE at his window overlooking the vastness of Coruscant. Several buildings have been destroyed. A brown haze hangs over the landscape.

PALPATINE: Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.

ANAKIN: The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?

PALPATINE: They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.

ANAKIN: I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.

PALPATINE: There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.

ANAKIN: With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.

PALPATINE: Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.

ANAKIN: Everyone will agree on that.

PALPATINE: Anakin, I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me, Anakin.

ANAKIN: Of course.

PALPATINE: I need your help, son.

ANAKIN: What do you mean?

PALPATINE: I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.

ANAKIN: I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.

PALPATINE: Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you.

ANAKIN: For what? I don't understand.

PALPATINE: To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . .

ANAKIN thinks about this.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.

ANAKIN: Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.

PALPATINE: I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.

81 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA'S OFFICE-DAY

PADME, BAIL ORGANA, and SENATORS MON MOTHMA, FANG ZAR, TERR TANEEL, and GIDDEAN DANU sit in Senator Organa 's office.

BAIL ORGANA: Now that he has control of the Jedi Council, the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic.

FANG ZAR: When did this happen?

BAIL ORGANA: The decree was posted this morning.

PADME: Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?

MON MOTHMA: Why bother? As a practical matter, the Senate no longer exists.

GIDDEAN DANU: The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives, sometimes a dozen in one day.

BAIL ORGANA: We can't let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight.

EVERYONE looks at each other, a little worried at the implications of what was just said.

TERR TANEEL: What are you suggesting?

BAIL ORGANA: I apologize. I didn't mean to sound like a Separatist.

MON MOTHMA: We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.

BAIL ORGANA: It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.

PADME: I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.

GlDDEAN DANU: Senator, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate.

MON MOTHMA: The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.

BAIL ORGANA: We can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .

PADME: Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it's better to leave some things unsaid.

BAIL ORGANA: Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing.

MON MOTHMA: That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.

They ALL nod their heads. PADME considers this for a moment.

PADME: Agreed.

82 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY OUTSIDE COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY

ANAKIN stands pensively in front of the Jedi Council Chambers. The door opens.

83 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY

ANAKIN enters and stands in the middle of the room. He is surrounded by the Jedi Council MACE WINDU, EETH KOTH OBI-WAN, YODA, the HOLOGRAMS of PLO KOON and KI-ADI-MUNDI.

MACE: Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative.

ANAKIN: I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.

YODA: Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.

ANAKIN: I understand.

MACE: You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.

Anakin reacts with anger.

ANAKIN: What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?

MACE: Take a seat, young Skywalker.

ANAKIN: Forgive me, Master.

ANAKIN goes and sits in one of the empty chairs. Everyone is embarrassed. KI-ADI-MUNDI WHO APPEARS AS A HOLOGRAM, speaks.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.

YODA: Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.

OBI-WAN: It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.

MACE: We cannot take ships from the front line.

OBI-WAN: And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.

YODA: Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?

MACE: It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!

OBI-WAN: He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.

ANAKIN: I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.

MACE: Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.

YODA: Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.

MACE: It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.

ANAKIN is disappointed.

84 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk through one of the massive Jedi Temple hallways. ANAKIN is furious.

ANAKIN: What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!

OBI-WAN: Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

ANAKIN: I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . .

OBI-WAN: But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.

ANAKIN: That has nothing to do with this.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation.

ANAKIN: You mean divided loyalties.

OBI-WAN: I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.

ANAKIN: The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.

OBI-WAN: No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous, dark thoughts.

ANAKIN: Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.

OBI-WAN: I hope so . . .

ANAKIN: I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.

ANAKIN: And?

OBI-WAN: Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.

ANAKIN: What situation?

OBI-WAN: (takes a deep breath) The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.

ANAKIN: They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!

OBI-WAN: We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.

ANAKIN: Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?

OBI-WAN: This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.

ANAKIN: The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.

OBI-WAN: That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.

ANAKIN: Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.

OBI-WAN: Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.

ANAKIN: You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?

OBI-WAN: The Council is asking you.

85 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

A JEDI GUNSHIP heads for the huge Clone landing platform.

86 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI GUNSHIP-DAY

YODA, MACE, and OBI-WAN ride in the GUNSHIP as it heads for the Clone landing platform. Mace and Obi-Wan are sitting.

OBI-WAN : Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.

YODA: Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.

MACE: It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.

OBI-WAN: He'll be all right. I trust him with my life.

MACE:I wish I did.

OBI-WAN: With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?

MACE: So the prophecy says.

YODA: A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.

OBI-WAN: He will not let me down. He never has.

YODA: I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.

The GUNSHIP lands and the ramp lowers. YODA exits the GUNSHIP. MACE and OBI-WAN stand and give him a brief bow then take off in the GUNSHIP.

87 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-SUNSET

Padme's Speeder pulls up to the landing platform. CAPTAIN TYPHO escorts PADME onto the veranda, where TWO HANDMAIDENS (ELLE and MOTEE) are waiting. PADME turns to CAPTAIN TYPHO.

PADME: Thank you, Captain.

CAPTAIN TYPHO: Rest well. My Lady.

CAPTAIN TYPHO gets back into the Speeder, and it disappears into the cityscape. The HANDMAIDENS, Motee and Elle, approach PADME as the SHADOW OF A FIGURE moves in the background. C-3PO is standing nearby.

PADME: I'll be up in a while.

MOTEE: Yes, my lady.

C-3PO stands, confused, as the HANDMAIDENS turn and exit.

C-3PO: Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?

PADME: Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.

The golden droid turns and exits.

PADME stands and watches the sunset. The SHADOWY FIGURE moves toward her. She senses something.

ANAKIN: Beautiful, isn't it?

PADME jumps and turns around.

PADME: You startled me.

He sits next to her on the bench.

ANAKIN: How are you feeling?

PADME: He keeps kicking.

ANAKIN: He?! Why do you think it's a boy?

PADME: (laughs) My motherly intuition.

She puts his hand on her belly.

ANAKIN: Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.

They laugh.

PADME: I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.

ANAKIN: I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.

PADME: Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.

ANAKIN: They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem.

PADME: Anakin . . .

ANAKIN: Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.

PADME: Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?

ANAKIN: (suspicious) What do you mean?

PADME: What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?

ANAKIN: I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!

PADME: Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.

ANAKIN: (growing angry) Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!

PADME: What is it?

ANAKIN: Nothing.

PADME: Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.

ANAKIN: You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you.

They look in each other's eyes.

ANAKIN: (continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.

PADME is startled at this.

PADME: I sense there are things you are not telling me.

PADME smiles. ANAKIN is a little embarrassed.

PADME: (continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.

88 INT. CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT

ANAKIN lands his speeder and exits.
ANAKIN runs up the stairs at the Galaxies Opera House.
ANAKIN runs through the hallway and enters Palpatine's box, where the CHANCELLOR is sitting with Mas Amedda and Sly-Moore, watching the Man Calamari Ballet doing "Squid Lake."

ANAKIN: You wanted to see me, Chancellor.

PALPATINE: Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.

ANAKIN: At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.

PALPATINE: I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far   but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.

ANAKIN: They try.

PALPATINE: Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us.

ANAKIN sits next to PALPATINE. The Chancellor leans over to him.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.

ANAKIN: I'm not sure I understand.

PALPATINE: You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.

ANAKIN: I don't think . . .

PALPATINE: Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?

ANAKIN: I know they don't trust you . . .

PALPATINE: Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.

ANAKIN: I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.

PALPATINE: Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

ANAKIN doesn't say anything. He simply looks down.

PALPATINE: (continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?

ANAKIN: I don't know ... I don't know what to say.

PALPATINE: Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. "All those who gain power are afraid to lose it." Even the Jedi.

ANAKIN: The Jedi use their power for good.

PALPATINE: Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .

ANAKIN: . . . evil.

PALPATINE: . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.

ANAKIN: The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.

PALPATINE: And the Jedi don't?

ANAKIN: The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.

PALPATINE smiles.

PALPATINE: Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?

ANAKIN: I'm not sure it's wrong.

PALPATINE: Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.

ANAKIN is deep in thought.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?

ANAKIN: No.

PALPATINE: I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.

ANAKIN: He could actually save people from death?

PALPATINE: The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

ANAKIN: What happened to him?

PALPATINE: He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

ANAKIN: Is it possible to learn this power?

PALPATINE: Not from a Jedi.

89 EXT. KASHYYYK-DAY

A WOOKIEE CATAMARAN flanked by WOOKIEE HELICOPTERS approaches the tree housing the HOLOGRAM AREA.

90 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY

YODA and various JEDI speak via hologram. The discussion includes OBI-WAN, MACE, AGEN KOLAR, YODA- KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: (holo) Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.

MACE: (holo) How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.

ANAKIN: A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.

YODA: Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.

OBI-WAN: Does everyone agree?

All the JEDI concur.

ANAKIN: The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.

They all look at ANAKIN a bit disturbed.

MACE: (a little peeved) The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: Yes, this decision is ours to make.

ANAKIN is embarrassed and becomes sullen.

YODA: A Master is needed, with more experience.

MACE: Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.

ANAKIN: He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.

OBI-WAN throws ANAKIN a dirty look.

ANAKIN: (continuing) No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact.

OBI-WAN: Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.

YODA: Obi-Wan, my choice is.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: I concur. Master Kenobi should go.

YODA: I agree.

All the JEDI concur.

MACE: Very well. Council is adjourned.

ANAKIN is angry.

MACE: (continuing) Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true, there's no telling how many battle droids he may have with him.

91 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY

YODA gets out of his chair and walks to the edge of the platform.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE: The droids have started up their main power generators.

YODA: Then now the time is, Commander.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE: Yes, sir.

The battle begins.

92 EXT. KASHYYYK-BEACH HEAD-DAY

A WOOKIEE CHIEFTAIN lets out a roar as the Wookiee army rushes to face the DROID ARMY. CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS race across the water against the WOOKIEES and CLONE TROOPERS on the beach. DROID GUNSHIPS provide air support, while a SPIDER DROID emerges from the watery depths. A brave WOOKIEE places an explosive on a SEPARATIST TANK and jumps off just before the TANK EXPLODES. From the Hologram Area, Yoda observes the ongoing battle.

93 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING

Padme's apartment building is surrounded by the smog-shrouded city of Coruscant.

94 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LIVING ROOM-EARLY MORNING

PADME and OBI-WAN sit on one of the couches.

OBI-WAN: Has Anakin been to see you?

PADME: Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.

OBI-WAN: I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.

They laugh.

PADME: You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?

OBI-WAN: You should be a Jedi, Padme.

PADME: You're not very good at hiding your feelings.

OBI-WAN: It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.

PADME: Why would he talk to me about his work?

OBI-WAN studies her.

OBI-WAN: Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.

PADME: Don't give me that look.

OBI-WAN: I know how he feels about you.

PADME: (nervous) What did he say?

OBI-WAN: Nothing. He didn't have to.

PADME is a little flustered. She stands and Obi-Wan follows. She walks to the balcony.

PADME: I don't know what you're talking about.

OBI-WAN: I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I'm worried about him.

PADME looks down and doesn't answer.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . .

They stand on the balcony and look off at the early morning city. OBI-WAN starts to leave. PADME stays looking off into the distant city.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Padme, I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends, I care about both of you . . .

PADME: Thank you, Obi-Wan.

OBI-WAN: Please do what you can to help him.

95 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-DAY

PADME, MON MOTHMA, and five other Senators (BANA BREEMU, FANG ZAR. CHI EEKWAY, GIDDEAN DANU, BAIL ORGANA) sit in Padme's living room. C-3PO serves drinks to the guests.

PADME: We cannot let this turn into another war.

BAIL ORGANA: Absolutely, that is the last thing we want.

MON MOTHMA: We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that's all.

PADME: I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.

BANA BREEMU: That would be dangerous.

MON MOTHMA: We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this.

PADME: I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.

GiDDEAN DANU: Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.

PADME: The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . .

CHI EEKWAY: Patience, Senator.

FANG ZAR: We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.

BANA BREEMU: When you present the "petition of the two thousand" to the Chancellor, things may change.

BAIL ORGANA: Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate, before we include the Jedi.

PADME takes a deep breath in frustration and disappointment.

96 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk onto a landing platform overlooking a docking bay where THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS and armored weapons, tanks, etc., are being loaded onto a massive REPUBLIC ASSAULT SHIP.

ANAKIN: You're going to need me on this one, Master.

OBI-WAN: Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.

OBI-WAN starts to turn and leave.

ANAKIN: Master!

OBI-WAN stops and ANAKIN walks over to him.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.

OBI-WAN: You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.

OBI-WAN starts down the ramp, then turns back.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.

ANAKIN: Well, there's always a first time.

OBI-WAN laughs.

They talk for a few more minutes before ANAKIN watches OBI-WAN depart.

ANAKIN: Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN: Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN heads down a ramp toward the waiting Republic cruiser.

97 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The Republic cruiser lifts off and heads for space.

98 INT. REPUBLIC BATTLE CRUISER-HANGAR-SPACE

CLONE TROOPERS stand at attention in rows on the floor of the hangar deck, waiting to board landing craft. OBI-WAN stands next to his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER- talking to SEVERAL CLONE COMMANDERS with their helmets off. A hologram of the planet Utapau is projected by R4-G9 into the middle of the hangar.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side.

OBI-WAN: I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?

They laugh.

OBI-WAN: (laughing) Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.

OBI-WAN climbs into his Jedi Fighter.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: That was Anakin who was late. I believe.

OBI-WAN: Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: I'm counting on you.

99 EXT. JEDI FIGHTER-SPACE

OBI-WAN blasts the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER out of the Republic Battle Cruiser and into the hyperspace ring. He heads for the planet Utapau.

100 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-CHANCELLOR'S TRANSPORT-DAY

The Chancellor's Transport races through the city and heads for the Senate Office Building landing platform. Waiting on the landing platform is a LONE JEDI. The Transport lands, and CHANCELLOR PALPATINE emerges with FOUR ROYAL GUARDS and MAS AMEDDA. The FOUR ROYAL GUARDS move off in another direction as PALPATINE greets ANAKIN, who has been waiting for him.

PALPATINE: Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?

ANAKIN: He will soon have Grievous's head.

PALPATINE: We can only hope the Council didn't make a mistake.

ANAKIN: The Council was very sure in its decision.

They exit the landing platform.

101 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-DAY

They enter the main hallway of the Senate Office Building. They pass SEVERAL SENATORS, including REPRESENTATIVE JAR JAR BINKS from Naboo.

JAR JAR: Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .

The Gungan waves to Anakin.

ANAKIN: Hi, Jar Jar.

JAR JAR: Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir.

Anakin turns back to the Chancellor.

PALPATINE: There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.

ANAKIN: Not fit? Why would anyone think that?

PALPATINE: They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.

ANAKIN: That's ridiculous. Who?!?

PALPATINE: (slyly) No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.

ANAKIN: That's impossible. I would know.

PALPATINE: Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.

ANAKIN becomes worried.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine.

102 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM

PADME calls out in pain. OBI-WAN is near her and softly speaks to her.

OBI-WAN: Save your energy.

PADME: I can't!

OBI-WAN: Don't give up, Padme. Don't give up . . .

103 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY

ANAKIN is in the living room, working. He sits on the couch where Obi-Wan was sitting. PADME enters and crosses behind him.

ANAKIN: I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

PADME: He came by this morning.

ANAKIN: What did he want?

PADME looks at him for a moment. ANAKIN seems tense.

PADME: He's worried about you.

ANAKIN: You told him about us, didn't you?

She continues to walk to the bedroom, he follows.

PADME: He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.

ANAKIN: And he's not?

PADME: You have been moody lately.

ANAKIN: I'm not moody . . .

PADME: Anakin! Don't do this again.

ANAKIN: I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.

PADME: Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.

ANAKIN: Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.

PADME: They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.

ANAKIN: Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't.

PADME: You expect too much of yourself.

They stop in front of the window in the bedroom. ANAKIN puts his hand on her belly.

ANAKIN: I have found a way to save you.

PADME: Save me?

ANAKIN: From my nightmares.

PADME: Is that what's bothering you?

ANAKIN: I won't lose you, Padme.

PADME: I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.

ANAKIN: No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying.

PADME looks ANAKIN in the eye.

PADME: You don't need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are.

They embrace and kiss.

104 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE

OBI-WAN blasts out of the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER's hyperspace ring and heads for the planet Utapau. The BLUE FIGHTER skims over the planet's surface, flat except for a few giant sinkholes.

105 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

OBI-WAN lands his ship on a Platform projecting out of the side of a giant sinkhole. All is quiet. A local administrator, TION MEDON, comes out to greet the ship. OBI-WAN climbs out of his Fighter as a SHORT GROUND CREW looks over his ship. On a ledge above the landing platform, GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS watch as OBI-WAN talks to TION MEDON.

TlON MEDON: Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?

OBI-WAN: Unfortunately, the war.

TlON MEDON: There is no war here unless you've brought it with you.

OBI-WAN: With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.

A GROUND CREW rushes out and refuels Obi-Wan s Fighter. TION MEDON leans close to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly.

TlON MEDON: He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us.

OBI-WAN: I understand.

TlON MEDON: The tenth level . . . thousands of Battle Droids . . .

OBI-WAN: Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time.

OBI-WAN starts back toward his Starfighter as TION MEDON leaves the Landing Platform. GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS retreat from the overhead platform. OBI-WAN climbs back into his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER. His Astro Unit (R4-G9) turns to him:

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Geenine, take the Fighter back to the ship. I'm staying here. Tell Cody I've made contact.

The little Astro Droid BEEPS a reply.

106 EXT. UTAPAU-OBSERVATION DECK-DAY

On a high balcony, TION MEDON looks down on the landing platform. A few steps behind him stands one of GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS. They watch the canopy lower.

TlON MEDON: I told you, all he wanted was fuel.

BODYGUARD: What was his name?

TlON MEDON: He didn't say.

They watch as the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER takes off.

107 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-HALLWAY-DAY

OBI-WAN also watches his ship take off. He is hiding in the hallway. He quietly moves farther into the city.

108 EXT. UTAPAU STAIRWAY-SINKHOLE RIM-DAY

OBI-WAN quickly rushes up a stairway cut into the side of the sinkhole. It's hard to see him. In an alcove, he carefully surveys the city, then quickly moves on.

109 INT. UTAPAU-CITY-DRAGON CORRAL-DAY

OBI-WAN makes his way through the city, looking up at the tenth level with electro-binoculars from his utility belt. He tries to figure out how he is going to get up there. He hears strange bellowing cries and he investigates.
He comes across a corral filled with about half a dozen DRAGON-LIKE LIZARDS. SEVERAL WRANGLERS are standing around.
OBI-WAN walks up to the WRANGLERS and uses the Force with his slight hand movements.

OBI-WAN: I need transportation.

WRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) You need transportation.

OBI-WAN: Get it for me.

WRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) I will get it for you.

One of the WRANGLERS turns to the others and chatters away in his strange tongue. OBI-WAN walks along the line of DRAGON LIZARDS, checking out each one. He looks at their teeth, legs, etc. Finally he pats one on the neck.

OBI-WAN: This one.

The WRANGLER brings the chosen one over to him.

WRANGLER: Boga. She answers to Boga.

OBI-WAN: Good girl, Boga.

OBI-WAN swings onto the back of the LIZARD. The beast rears up and scurries outside to the edge of the sinkhole.

110 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LIZARD-DAY

The LIZARD BOGA rears up on her hind legs again, then climbs the wall of the sheer cliff and starts moving up toward the tenth level. The city appears to be deserted. OBI-WAN is alert to any movement.

111 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY

GENERAL GRIEVOUS stands before the COUNCIL OF SEPARATISTS, including NUTE GUNRAY, RUNE HAAKO. POGGLE THE LESSER, SHU MAI, SAN HILL PO NUDO, WAT TAMBOR, and PASSEL ARGENTE. OBI-WAN hides above the assembly and watches intently.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.

NUTE GUNRAY: Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip . . . Your ship is waiting.

OBI-WAN is deep in thought.

112 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY

The JEDI removes his cloak and jumps down behind the GENERAL.

OBI-WAN: Hello, there!

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you're doomed, (to droids) Kill him!

About a HUNDRED BATTLE DROIDS surround OBI-WAN, GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and his BODYGUARDS. OBI-WAN looks around, then walks right up to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
They stare at each other for a moment.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Enough of this.

The BODYGUARDS raise their power staffs to knock OBI-WAN away, but OBI-WAN ducks as the deadly staffs whistle over his head. The Jedi's lightsaber ignites, and OBI-WAN deftly cuts one BODYGUARD in two. His staff flies into the air and is caught by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. The other THREE BODYGUARDS attack OBI-WAN with an intense fury.
OBI-WAN uses the Force to release apiece of equipment from the ceiling. It drops on the BODYGUARDS, smashing them. OBI-WAN walks toward GRIEVOUS, slashing the last BODYGUARD to pieces. BATTLE DROIDS move toward OBI-WAN.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.

OBI-WAN: Your move.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.

His arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. His four arms create a flashing display of swordsmanship.

OBI-WAN: You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!

OBI-WAN is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly onslaught. They fight across the control room as the BATTLE DROID SHARPSHOOTERS try to pick off the Jedi. OBI-WAN mounts a ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of GRIEVOUS's hands. A loud EXPLOSION is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole. GENERAL GRIEVOUS and OBI-WAN glance to the entrance of the control center and see CLONE TROOPS in the distance, attacking DROIDS in the sinkhole. On the far wall of the sinkhole, CLONES can be seen rappelling onto balconies.

OBI-WAN: I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.

OBI-WAN: I don't think so.

TWENTY CLONES suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center, ray guns blazing. Chaos. Laser bolts fly everywhere as the DROIDS return fire. OBI-WAN attacks GENERAL GRIEVOUS, who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard's electro-staffs. OBI-WAN uses the Force to hurl GENERAL GRIEVOUS backwards. He falls onto a lower platform and OBI-WAN jumps down after him.

113 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY

More CLONES rappel into the control center and blast away at the remaining DROIDS.
The JEDI cuts down several DROIDS as he races to the entrance of the control center. OBI-WAN spots GENERAL GRIEVOUS racing toward one of the landing platforms in the midst of the battle. GENERAL GRIEVOUS jumps onto a WHEEL SCOOTER and takes off down the wall of the sinkhole. OBI-WAN whistles for his LIZARD BOGA, who runs to him. OBI-WAN jumps on.

114 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The chase begins. Obi-Wan drops his lightsaber while riding Boga.

115 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-SUNSET

The sun is setting as the lights come on in the massive Senate Office Building. The sky is red.

116 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-SUNSET

PALPATINE listens to a delegation from the Senate, which includes PADME and five other Senators: NEE ALAVAR, FANG ZAR, MALEDEE, SWEITT CONCORKILL, and MON CALAMARI. ANAKIN stands to one side of PALPATINE.

PALPATINE: I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.

PADME: May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?

PALPATINE: I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .

PADME: You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.

PALPATINE: You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here.

FANGZAR: But surely . . .

The Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR.

PALPATINE: I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.

PADME: On behalf of the "delegation of two thousand," I thank you, Chancellor.

PALPATINE: I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator.

PADME gives ANAKIN a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the other FIVE SENATORS. PALPATINE turns to ANAKIN.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.

ANAKIN: What do you mean?

PALPATINE: They are not to be trusted.

ANAKIN: Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .

PALPATINE: These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.

ANAKIN: I'm sure you're mistaken.

PALPATINE: I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.

ANAKIN: I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.

PALPATINE studies ANAKIN carefully and gives him a skeptical look.

PALPATINE: Yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin.

117 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI WAR ROOM-EARLY EVENING

KI-ADI-MUNDI, ANAKIN, YODA, MACE, CLONE COMMANDER CODY, and AAYLA SECURA talk via holograms.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we
have begun our attack.

MACE WlNDU: Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his
intentions.

ANAKIN: Yes, Master.

ANAKIN leaves the room. COMMANDER CODY's hologram disappears.

MACE WINDU: I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from
office.

MACE WiNDU: That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.

YODA: To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.

118 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING

ANAKIN brings news to PALPATINE.

ANAKIN: Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.

PALPATINE: We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.

ANAKIN: I should be there with him.

PALPATINE: It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?

ANAKIN: I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.

PALPATINE: They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.

They walk into the hallway.

ANAKIN: How do you know the ways of the Force?

PALPATINE: My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.

They stop.

ANAKIN: You know the dark side?!?

PALPATINE: Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. (pausing) They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.

ANAKIN: I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.

PALPATINE: Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.

ANAKIN: What did you say?

PALPATINE: Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .

ANAKIN: You're a Sith Lord!

ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.

PALPATINE: I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.

ANAKIN: You're wrong!

PALPATINE: Are you going to kill me?

ANAKIN: I would certainly like to.

PALPATINE: I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.

ANAKIN raises his lightsaber to PALPATINE's throat. There is a tense moment, then ANAKIN relaxes, and then turns off his lightsaber.

ANAKIN: I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.

PALPATINE: Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?

ANAKIN: I will quickly discover the truth of all this.

PALPATINE: You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. The power to save Padme.

ANAKIN stares at him for a moment.
PALPATINE turns and moves to his office.

PALPATINE: (continuing) I am not going anywhere. You have time to decide my fate. Perhaps you'll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the good of all . . .

PALPATINE sits behind his desk.

119 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

OBI-WAN gives the LIZARD a swift kick with the heel of his boot, and they take off down the vertical side of the sheer cliff. As GENERAL GRIEVOUS reaches the landing platform where his shuttle is waiting. OBI-WAN drops onto the top of the starship with his LIZARD. GENERAL GRIEVOUS spins his scooter around and takes off up the vertical cliff face with OBI-WAN and his LIZARD in hot pursuit. The sinkhole is engulfed in a great battle between CLONES and DROIDS. The PEOPLE OF UTAPAU cower in whatever shelter they can find.

120 EXT. UTAPAU-MAIN CITY PLAZA-DAY

A LARGE GROUP OF UTAPAUAN TROOPS on LIZARDS attack the DROID ARMY.

OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race through the city at breakneck speed. Passing through battle zones, narrowly escaping EXPLOSIONS, laser bolts, and TROOPS from both sides.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS lays the Scooter down as he goes around sharp turns. Obi-Wan's LIZARD breathes hard as she tries to keep up. They destroy droids, equipment, and clone troops as the JEDI and the GENERAL cut a swath of destruction through the city.

121 EXT. UTAPAU-WINDMILLS-DAY

GENERAL GRIEVOUS works his way out onto the rim of the sinkhole, passing some wind blades. The evil Droid General releases the brakes on the lethal blades, and they begin to spin, cutting off Obi-Wan's access to the General. Obi-Wan's LIZARD pulls up short in front of the blades. GENERAL GRIEVOUS laughs and talks into a comlink.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Prepare to move out of orbit. I will be up in a few moments.

OBI-WAN sizes up the situation, looking for a way to get to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

The GENERAL accelerates off the edge, activating his claws, drops, and clings to another nearby grouping of windmills. Obi-Wan's LIZARD attempts to jump to follow and barely makes it, almost falling into the precipice below.

122 INT. UTAPAU-CITY TUNNEL SYSTEM-DAY

GENERAL GRIEVOUS roars through the stone block tunnel system, riding up on the curved walls as he goes around corners or passes oncoming traffic. OBI-WAN races after the Droid, his LIZARD moving onto the ceiling as they pass traffic. OBI-WAN catches up with GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and they charge through the tunnel, side by side. OBI-WAN grabs the Droid's electronic staff.

123 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

Extending from the wall of a small sinkhole is a secret landing platform with a small Federation Fighter sitting in the middle of it. OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race out of the tunnel system and onto the landing platform.

OBI-WAN yanks on the staff, then jumps off his LIZARD onto the General's scooter, knocking both warriors to the ground. GENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls out a laser pistol and fires at OBI-WAN. The Jedi reaches out his hand, grabs the General's electro-staff and spins the staff, blocking the laser bolts.

OBI-WAN charges GENERAL GRIEVOUS, swinging the staff and hitting the Droid in the stomach, knocking the gun away. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is hit by the staff, and the Force bends his forearm. He pulls OBI-WAN close to him, and they engage in a furious fight. The electro-staff is knocked away. The two engage in hand-to-hand combat. OBI-WAN struggles to avoid the deadly blows of the brutal, unstoppable Droid.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS's stomachplate is loose. OBI-WAN grabs it and rips it off, revealing the alien life form's guts encased in a bag in the Droid's chest. GENERAL GRIEVOUS grabs OBI-WAN, hoists him over his head, and tosses him across the platform. OBI-WAN dangles off the edge of the platform. He clutches the rim, trying to hold on. The DROID then grabs the staff and charges OBI-WAN. At the last second, OBI-WAN reaches out his hand and uses the Force to retrieve the Droid's laser pistol.

The JEDI fires several blasts in the stomach area of the alien Droid, and he EXPLODES from the inside out. The smoldering Droid falls to the ground. OBI-WAN has killed GENERAL GRIEVOUS. He pulls himself up onto the platform and walks by the destroyed carcass.

OBI-WAN: So uncivilized . . .

OBI-WAN brushes himself off. He throws the pistol onto the platform, picks up the electro-staff, and jumps on BOGA. The trusty beast rears up and takes off into the tunnel system.

124 INT. JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING

MACE and the JEDI (AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, AND SAESEE TIIN) are preparing to board a JEDI GUNSHIP to the CHANCELLOR's office. ANAKIN enters the hangar.

ANAKIN: Master Windu, I must talk to you.

MACE WiNDU: What is it, Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.

ANAKIN: He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.

MACE WINDU: A Sith Lord?

ANAKIN: Yes. The one we have been looking for.

MACE WiNDU: How do you know this?

ANAKIN: He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.

MACE WiNDU: Are you sure?

ANAKIN: Absolutely.

MACE WiNDU: Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.

ANAKIN: Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.

MACE WiNDU: For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.

ANAKIN: I must go, Master.

MACE WiNDU: No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.

ANAKIN: Yes, Master.

MACE WiNDU: Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.

ANAKIN: Yes, Master.

ANAKIN watches as the JEDI leave in their ship.

125 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI COUNCIL PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY EVENING

(INTERCUT)

PADME is alone in her apartment, thinking of Anakin. ANAKIN sits alone in the Jedi Council Chamber thinking of PADME.

PALPATINE: (V.O.) You do know, don't you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.

PADME: I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know.

C-3PO: My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?

ANAKIN: I can't do this ... I can't let her die.

ANAKIN rushes out of the Council Chamber and to his speeder. The hangar door opens and he lifts off.

126 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING

The sky is still blue as a JEDI GUNSHIP lands on the Senate Office Building landing platform.
FOUR JEDI exit the SHUTTLE and enter the Senate Office Building. MACE WINDU, AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, and SAESEE TIIN, like gunfighters out of the Old West, walk through the massive hallway, four across.

127 INT. CORUSCANT-LOBBY TO CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING

The FOUR JEDI enter the lobby, raising their arms, and send the Chancellor's aide, DAR WAC, flying against the wall, along with TWO REPUBLIC GUARDS. They storm into the Chancellor's office.

128 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING

MACE arrives with THREE JEDI to arrest PALPATINE.

PALPATINE: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.

MACE WINDU: In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.

MACE WINDU and the other JEDI ignite their lightsabers.

PALPATINE: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?

MACE: The Senate will decide your fate.

PALPATINE: (burst of anger) I am the Senate!

MACE: Not yet!

PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.

PALPATINE: It's treason, then.

A close shot of PALPATINE as the fight begins. Close shots of THREE JEDI getting cut down by PALPATINE. PALPATINE and MACE continue to fight.

Jedi Master MACE WINDU and the Sith Lord fight their way down the hallway and into the main office area. PALPATINE is able to use the Force to slam MACE against the wall, but he recovers before the Chancellor can cut him down.

ANAKIN lands his speeder, jumps out, and runs down a long corridor toward the Chancellor's office.

In the heat of battle, MACE cuts the window behind the Chancellor's desk, and it crashes away. MACE is forced out onto the ledge, which is twenty stories up. They fight over the precipice. ANAKIN arrives to see PALPATINE and MACE fighting.

They stop as MACE forces PALPATINE to drop his sword. PALPATINE and MACE start yelling at each other.

MACE WINDU: You are under arrest, My Lord.

PALPATINE: Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.

MACE WlNDU: You old fool. The oppression of the Sith will never return. Your plot to regain control of the Republic is over . . . you have lost . . .

PALPATINE: No! No! You will die!

PALPATINE raises his hands, and lightning bolts shoot out. They are blocked by MACE's lightsaber. PALPATINE is pushed back against the window sill.

PALPATINE: He is a traitor, Anakin.

MACE WlNDU: He's the traitor. Stop him!

PALPATINE: Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.

MACE WlNDU: Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .

PALPATINE: You are not one of them, Anakin. Don't let him kill me.

MACE WlNDU: Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .

PALPATINE: I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.

MACE WlNDU: Don't listen to him, Anakin.

PALPATINE: Help me! Don't let him kill me. I can't hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . .

MACE pushes PALPATINE out to the edge of the ledge. As the Jedi moves closer, the bolts from Palpatine's hands begin to arch back on him. The Chancellor's face begins to twist and distort. His eyes become yellow as he struggles to intensify his powers.

PALPATINE: I can't ... I give up. Help me. I am weak ... I am too weak. Don't kill me. I give up. I'm dying. I can't hold on any longer.

MACE WlNDU: You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.

ANAKIN: You can't kill him, Master. He must stand trial.

MACE WlNDU: He has too much control of the Senate and the Courts. He is too dangerous to be kept alive.

PALPATINE: I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.

ANAKIN: It is not the Jedi way . . .

MACE raises his sword to kill the CHANCELLOR.

ANAKIN: (continuing) He must live . . .

PALPATINE: Please don't, please don't . . .

ANAKIN: I need him . . .

PALPATINE: Please don't . . .

ANAKIN: NO!!!

Just as MACE is about to slash PALPATINE, ANAKIN steps in and cuts off the Jedi's hand holding the lightsaber.

As MACE stares at ANAKIN in shock, PALPATINE springs to life.
The full force of Palpatine's powerful Bolts blasts MACE. He attempts to deflect them with his one good hand, but the force is too great. As blue rays engulf his body, he is flung out the window and falls twenty stories to his death. No more screams. No more moans. PALPATINE lowers his arm.

PALPATINE: Power! Unlimited power!

His face has changed into a horrible mask of evil. ANAKIN looks on in horror. PALPATINE cackles.

ANAKIN: What have I done?

ANAKIN sits.

PALPATINE: You are fulfilling your destin, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.

ANAKIN: I will do whatever you ask.

PALPATINE: Good.

ANAKIN: Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her. I won't let her die. I want the power to stop death.

PALPATINE: To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.

ANAKIN kneels before PALPATINE.

ANAKIN: I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.

PALPATINE: Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader.

ANAKIN: Thank you. my Master.

PALPATINE: Rise, Darth Vader.

Palpatine moves over to his desk.

129 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY

YODA winces, closes his eyes, and holds his head. He feels a disturbance in the Force.

130 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EVENING

PALPATINE is putting on his dark cloak: he is now fully DARTH SIDIOUS.

PALPATINE: Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.

ANAKIN: I agree. The Jedi's next move will be against the Senate.

PALPATINE: Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don't you?

ANAKIN: I understand, Master.

PALPATINE: We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.

ANAKIN: What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?

PALPATINE: Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.

131 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE ENTRY-NIGHT

ANAKIN goes to the Jedi Temple with a battalion of Clone Troopers.

132 EXT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-LANDIXG PLATFORM-DAY

The battle between the CLONES and the DROIDS rages throughout the sinkhole. OBI-WAN rides up to CLONE COMMANDER CODY.

OBI-WAN: Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Very good, sir.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY starts to move away, then remembers something and returns to OBI-WAN.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: (continuing) Oh, by the way, I think you'll be needing this.

He hands OBI-WAN his lightsaber, and the LIZARD rears up.

OBI-WAN: Thank you, Cody, (smiling) Now let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win here.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Yes, sir!

OBI-WAN and the LIZARD ride off down the wall of the giant sinkhole.
The battle rages throughout the city. CLONE COMMANDER CODY (2224,) takes out his comlink and listens to the HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS as, far below, OBI-WAN can been seen battling DROIDS on a landing platform.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: It will be done, My Lord.

The HOLOGRAM disappears, and CLONE COMMANDER CODY gestures to a nearby Clone Trooper.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Blast him!

The battle rages all around OBI-WAN. DROIDS and CLONES are everywhere. OBI-WAN is riding on a LIZARD, cutting down DROIDS as he races across the battlefield. Suddenly a volley of laser blasts from behind him knocks him and his LIZARD off the wall of the sinkhole. He looks around just in time to see his CLONE TROOPS are firing on him.
OBI-WAN falls hundreds of feet to the bottom of the water-filled sinkhole.

133 EXT. MYGEETO-DAWN

The sky slowly awakens on the crystal world of Mygeeto. A battle rages. Clone troops battle the droid armies across a long bridge. KI-ADI-MUNDi uses his light saber to deflect enemy fire. CLONE COMMANDER BACARA (1138) exits a Gunship near the entrance to the city. He rallies his TROOPS to attack the city, then gets a message on his comlink. He stops and moves to one side as a HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS appears on the comlink in the palm of his hand. He moves further into the shadows.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Commander 1138 . . .

CLONE COMMANDER BACARA: Yes, sir.

DARTH SlDIOUS: The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.

CLONE COMMANDER BACARA: It will be done, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades, and the CLONE COMMANDER snaps the comlink closed and looks to the main plaza of the city, where KI-ADI-MUNDI is leading the charge. The clones stop. KI-ADI-MUNDI turns around and is blasted by clone fire. He's killed before he can defend himself.

134 EXT. FELUCIA-FOREST-DAY

A column of CLONE WALKERS marches across the forest floor. The STRANGE CALLS of the alien forest creatures of FELUCIA suddenly stop. The Jedi AAYLA SECURA and her CLONE TROOPS brace for an ambush.

AAYLA: Steady. . . . steady . . .

They all look around for signs of the enemy. CLONE COMMANDER BLY moves up behind the Jedi.

AAYLA: (continuing) Bly, do you think they're Droids?

BLY: No.

BLY blasts AAYLA in the back. The OTHER CLONES fire on her as she hits the ground.

Another Jedi, BARRISS OFFEE, is cutting down a patrol of DROIDS when a CLONE WALKING TANK and SEVEN CLONE TROOPERS round a corner and blast the Jedi away.

135 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY

YODA drops his gimer stick, clutches his chest, and rests against a wall.

136 EXT. KASHYYYK-EDGE OF VILIAGE-DAY

The battle appears to be over. WOOKIEES stack destroyed Droids while CLONES assess the damage to their equipment. A Jedi, LUMINARA UNDULI, talks with EIGHT CLONE OFFICERS standing in a circle around her. Suddenly they reveal their hidden pistols and blast her before she can react.

The Jedi QUINLAN VOS is riding on top of a CLONE TURBO TANK. The main cannon of a second tank slowly swings to point right at him and a COUPLE OF CLONES.
The cannon fires, and QUINLAN VOS and the CLONES disappear in a huge EXPLOSION.

141 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-NIGHT

DARTH SIDIOUS stands alone in his private office, illuminated only from a hologram projector beam from above. A small HOLOGRAM OF COMMANDER GREE stands in front of him.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE: Yes, My Lord.

DABTH SIDIOUS: The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.

142 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL BALCONY-DAY

A vista of waterways, high green mesas, and giant tree cities serves as a backdrop for the fierce battle, CLONES AND WOOKIEES against TRADE FEDERATION DROID ARMIES, with treaded tank-like vehicles. CLONE COMMANDER GREE holds his comlink.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE: It will be done, My Lord.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE snaps his comlink shut.

YODA watches from the balcony. The battle rages as CLONES and WOOKIEES attack DROIDS coming across the water on CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL stand on either side of the Jedi Master as he watches the battle below. CLONE COMMANDER GREE and ONE OFFICER walk onto the balcony toward YODA. YODA stands looking over the battlefield below. When they are close enough, the CLONES reveal their weapons and fire.

But faster than the CLONES can reveal their weapons, YODA ignites his lightsaber, leaps in the air, and beheads both CLONES. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL fire their weapons as more CLONES enter the hall. The Wookiees call out to YODA to follow them. CHEWBACCA picks YODA up and carries him away.

143 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-NIGHT

A JEDI is surrounded and gunned down by CLONE TROOPERS.

144 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-NIGHT

He exits Shaak Ti's room and enters a hallway, where the battle is taking place.

145 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BATTLE-NIGHT

ANAKIN enters a room full of YOUNGLINGS huddled in a corner.

YOUNGLINGS: Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do?

ANAKIN looks back at them with a stern expression on his face and ignites his lightsaber.

146 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-PRE-DAWN

C-3PO and PADME look out the apartment window.

C-3PO: The Chancellor's office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple. Don't worry, My Lady. I am sure he will be all right.

PADME bursts into tears.

147 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN

The city planet is covered in a hazy glow. A column of black smoke can be seen rising in the distance. BAIL ORGANA's Speeder flies overhead, straight toward the smoke.

148 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LANDING PLATFORM-PRE-DAWN

The Jedi Temple is on fire. Large plumes of smoke billow toward the sky as BAIL ORGANA lands his Speeder on a Jedi Temple platform. FOUR CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance to the Temple. They lower their guns as BAIL gets out of his Speeder and walks toward them.

BAIL ORGANA: What's going on here?!?

CLONE SERGEANT: There's been a rebellion. Don't worry, sir, the situation is under control.

The CLONES bar the Senator from entering the Temple.

CLONE SERGEANT: (continuing) I'm sorry, sir. No one is allowed entry.

The CLONES point their guns at BAIL and cock them.

CLONE SERGEANT: (continuing) It's time for you to leave, sir.

BAIL ORGANA: And so it is.

BAIL reluctantly heads hack toward his Speeder. Suddenly, several SHOTS RING OUT. BAIL turns and sees a ten-year-old Jedi, ZETT JUKASSA, fighting the CLONES. Several more CLONES join in the fight, followed by CLONE COMMANDER APPO (1119), who points at BAIL.

CLONE COMMANDER APPO: Get him! Shoot him!

SEVERAL CLONES start firing at BAIL. The Senator jumps for cover behind his Speeder, starting the engines and pulling out his laser
pistol.

The YOUNG JEDI cuts down several CLONES, including APPO, before he is overrun and shot.

The Speeder takes off with BAIL clinging to the side. The CLONES fire at it as it disappears into the cityscape.

149 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN

BAIL ORGANA struggles to pull himself into the Speeder as it races along through the cityscape. Finally, he climbs in, just as the Speeder is about to hit a building. BAIL steers clear of the building and races away.

150 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER SINKHOLE-DAY

The Jedi dives below the surface amid a barrage of laser fire. He dives deeper under the water, fumbling in his utility belt for a breathing device. He finds it and puts it in his mouth. He swims underwater until the CLONE TROOPS give up and stop filing.

151 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER CAVES-DAY

OBI-WAN removes the breathing apparatus after coming up from underwater. He starts to climb the rock wall.

OBI-WAN climbs the wall to the second cave just as TWO LITTLE SEEKER DRONES pop out of the water with their searchlights glowing. OBI-WAN presses himself against the wall of the smaller cave as the TWO SEEKER DRONES search the grotto. One of the SEEKERS begins to enter the cave in which OBI-WAN is hiding. OBI-WAN presses further into the wall. The light shines on the opposite wall and moves to the back of the cave, illuminating a huge NOS MONSTER. OBI-WAN holds his breath. The SEEKER is confused for a moment, then the NOS MONSTER lunges at the SMALL DROID and consumes it in one bite.

The NOS MONSTER'S lunge takes him past OBI-WAN, out of the cave, and into the water.

The SECOND SEEKER shines its light on the NOS MONSTER as the evil creature tries to grab the LITTLE DRONE. OBI-WAN slinks off toward the back of the cave. He comes upon a nest of BABY NOS MONSTERS. They SCREECH and make horrible sounds. OBI-WAN jumps over them and continues on his way through the tunnel system.

152 EXT. KASHYYYK-LAKE ON VILLAGE EDGE-DUSK

CLONES in modified one-man AT-ST's and Swamp Speeders flash their searchlights across the gloomy lake. The light of one of the AT-ST's spots something floating in the water. It is what's left of a Wookiee catamaran. The body of a dead Wookiee (TARFFUL) is lying across the stern of the wreckage of the flying boat. There is some movement on the boat. The CLONE SERGEANT on the AT-ST fires a warning shot past the boat.

AT-ST CLONE SERGEANT: Everyone out of there!

A CRAZY LITTLE CREATURE about two feet high pops its head over the rail. The creature is covered with mud. His long hair is frizzed out in all directions.

CREATURE: Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee. (crazy little laugh)

CLONE SERGEANT: Did you find something?

CREATURE: It's nothing, nothing. (laughs)

CLONE SERGEANT: It's nothing, nothing. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east.

CLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir.

Suddenly, CHEWBACCA climbs up behind the AT-ST CLONE, dripping wet, and throws the CLONE SERGEANT into the water. CHEWIE BARKS.

CREATURE: Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be.

TARFFUL jumps up in the boat, and the CREATURE takes off his hair. It is Yoda.

YODA: Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me.

YODA, covered with mud, jumps into the water. TARFFUL climbs onto the AT-ST with CHEWBACCA. YODA is out of the water and putting his robes back on.

YODA: (continuing) Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . .

YODA whistles and a large ALIEN FLYING INSECT called CAN-CELL appears. YODA jumps on the insect's back and they take off. The WOOKIEES follow on the AT-ST. The CLONES continue to search the swamp.

153 EXT. KASHYYYK-HILLS OVERLOOKING LAKE-DUSK

The AT-ST marches up the hill and stops. The WOOKIEES jump down. YODA lands on CAN-CELL nearby. CHEWBACCA goes to a tree and pulls down one of its branches.
The ground opens up, and a small WOOKIEE ESCAPE POD rises into the field. YODA opens the door of the pod.

YODA: Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have.

The Wookiees BARK as the Jedi climbs into the WOOKIEE POD and takes off into the dusk sky.

154 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-UNDERGROUND STARSHIP LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

BAIL ORGANA walks out of a tunnel onto a huge underground platform with two of his AIDES. He is stopped by TWO ROYAL GUARDS.

ROYAL GUARD: Identification . . .

BAIL ORGANA: Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan.

BAIL and his AIDES hand them their ID cards. The ROYAL GUARDS check them over and give them back, then BAIL and his CREW walk on board his Starship.

155 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-UNDERGROUND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The platform rises to the surface of the Office Building. The ALDERAAN STARCRUISER takes off and disappears into the crisp morning sky.

BAIL ORGANA is greeted by CAPTAIN ANTILLES and TWO ALDERAAN TROOPERS.

BAIL ORGANA: Were you able to get hold of a Jedi homing beacon?

CAPTAIN ANTILLES: Yes, sir. We've encountered no opposition. The clones are still a bit confused. It appears no one is in command.

BAIL ORGANA: That will change soon. Hopefully we will be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.

157 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LATE DAY

OBI-WAN hides from a group of CLONE TROOPERS.

CLONE CAPTAIN: Did you find Kenobi?

CLONE TROOPER: No one could have survived that fall.

He watches them pass.

CLONE CAPTAIN: Start loading your men on the ship.

CLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir.

OBI-WAN tries to sneak back to the secret platform, down a flight of stairs.

158 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY

OBI-WAN makes his way out of the cave and onto General Grievous's secret landing platform. He runs to the Starfighter and climbs into the one-man ship. The Starfighter takes off and disappears into the sky.

159 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE

OBI-WAN flies away from the planet Utapau in General Grievous's tiny Starfighter.

160 INT. GENERAL GRIEVOUS'S STARFIGHTER-SPACE

OBI-WAN activates the controls on the Starfighter. He punches in several coordinates and codes. A BEEPING SOUND is heard. It quickly speeds up until it is a steady tone. OBI-WAN speaks into his comlink.

OBI-WAN: Emergency Code Nine Thirteen ... I have no contact on any frequency. Are there any Jedi out there? . . . anywhere . . .

A BURST OF STATIC is heard- and a FUZZY HOLOGRAM image appears.

BAIL: (hologram) . . . Kenobi . . .

OBI-WAN: (continuing) I've locked on. Repeat.

The FUZZY HOLOGRAM image comes into focus, and it is BAIL ORGANA.

BAIL ORGANA: Master Kenobi??

OBI-WAN: Senator Organa! My Clone Troops turned on me ... I need help.

BAIL ORGANA: We have just rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has happened everywhere. We're sending you our coordinates.

161 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME SAPARTMENT-PRE-DAWN

PADME stands before the window of her living room, watching the plume of smoke from the Jedi Temple. C-3PO enters from the bedroom.

C-3PO: My Lady, there's a Jedi fighter docking on the veranda.

PADME turns and rushes to the bedroom.

162 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN

THREEPIO walks out to ANAKIN's ship and talks with ARTOO. ARTOO beeps.

THREEPIO: Hush! Not so loud!

PADME rushes onto the veranda as ANAKIN exits his GREEN JEDI FIGHTER. They embrace.

PADME: Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.

ANAKIN: I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.

PADME: Captain Typho's here, we're safe. What's happening?

C-3PO continues to talk to R2-D2 on the GREEN FIGHTER.

C-3PO: What is going on?

ARTOO SQUEAKS and BEEPS.

C-3PO: (continuing) You can't be anymore confused than I am.

ANAKIN: The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .

PADME: I can't believe that!

ANAKIN: I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.

C-3PO leans over and whispers to ARTOO.

C-3PO: Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids.

ARTOO BEEPS rather loudly. C-3PO puts his fingers to his lips.

C-3PO: (continuing) Shhhhhh . . . not so loud.

ARTOO BEEPS quietly.

C-3PO: (continuing) Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know.

PADME: Anakin, what are you going to do?

ANAKIN looks down for a moment and then walks away from Padme.

ANAKIN: I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.

ANAKIN turns and walks back to Padme.

PADME: What about Obi-Wan?

ANAKIN: I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor.

PADME: How could this have happened?

ANAKIN: The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.

PADME stands and reacts ever so slightly.

PADME: What are you saying?

ANAKIN: You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.

PADME: What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?

ANAKIN: That won't happen. I won't let it.

PADME: Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid.

ANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.

ANAKIN: Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise.

They kiss.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Please, wait for me.

PADME: I will.

ANAKIN gets into his Fighter as THREEPIO backs away.

C-3PO: (to Artoo) Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo.

ARTOO beeps.

C-3PO: (continuing) Take care, my little friend.

ARTOO BEEPS a good-bye, and the fighter takes off. PADME is left alone on the veranda. She starts to cry. THREEPIO comes up to her.

C-3PO: (continuing) My Lady, is there anything I might do?

PADME: No thank you, Threepio.

G-3PO: A snack, perhaps?

PADME: No.

THREEPIO starts to move off.

C-3PO: I feel so helpless.

163 EXT. ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-SPACE

OBI-WAN's ship docks with Bail Organa's Starcruiser.

164 INT. ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY

The door to the main hallway slides open. OBI-WAN enters and is greeted by YODA and BAIL ORGANA. The three walk down the hallway.

BAIL ORGANA: You made it.

YODA: Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is.

OBI-WAN: You were attacked by your Clones, also?

YODA: With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.

OBI-WAN: How many other Jedi managed to survive?

YODA: Heard from no one, have we.

BAIL ORGANA: I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple. That's why I went looking for Yoda.

OBI-WAN: Have we had any contact from the Temple?

YODA: Received a coded retreat message, we have.

BAIL ORGANA: It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says that the war is over . . .

OBI-WAN: Well, then we must go back! If there are other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.

BAIL ORGANA: It's too dangerous to return.

YODA: Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?

OBI-WAN: Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened.

YODA: I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way.

165 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LAVA FIELDS-DAY

Workers move across the lava beds, gathering the magma. A column of aliens riding giant MUSTAFAR FLEAS marches forward.

166 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

A HOLOGRAM of DARTH SIDIOUS is in the center of the room. NUTE GUNRAY and the REST OF THE SEPARATIST COALITION watch SIDIOUS.

DARTH SIDIOUS: You have done well, Viceroy. When my new apprentice, Darth Vader, arrives, he will take care of you.

The hologram disappears.

167 INT. CRUISER-COCKPIT

The Republic Cruiser heads toward Coruscant. OBI-WAN, BAIL, YODA, and TWO PILOTS sit in the cockpit.

PILOT: We are receiving a message from the Chancellor's office, sir.

BAIL ORGANA: Send it through.

PILOT: Yes, sir.

The PILOT pushes some buttons. MAS AMEDDA appears on screen.

MAS AMEDDA: Senator Organa . . . the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic requests your presence at a special session of Congress.

BAIL ORGANA: Tell the Chancellor I will be there.

MAS AMEDDA: Very well. He will be expecting you.

MAS AMEDDA's image disappears from the screen.

BAIL ORGANA: It could be a trap.

OBI-WAN: No, I don't think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact.

YODA: If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.

168 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY

OBI-WAN, BAIL, and YODA land on Coruscant. The elevator door opens, and they step out.

GUARD: Welcome back, Senator. May I see your clearance?

BAIL ORGANA: Certainly.

GUARD: Thank you, you may proceed. We will take custody of the Jedi.

OBI-WAN: It would be better if we stayed with the Senator.

GUARD: It would be better if they stayed with you.

BAIL and his AIDES go into the Senate. YODA and OBI-WAN head for the Jedi Temple.

169 EXT. MUSTAFAR-JEDI STARFIGHTER-SPACE

ANAKIN's Jedi Starfighter heads for the hazy blood-red planet of Mustafar.

170 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

ANAKIN flies over the volcanoes of Mustafar and lands his Jedi Starfighter on a complex of Landing Platforms. His cockpit opens as R2-D2 pops from the ship with a happy BEEP.

ANAKIN: Artoo . . . stay with the ship.

ARTOO lets out a sad little BEEP and moves back toward the ship.

171 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

ANAKIN, putting on his hood, walks across a walkway upon arriving on Mustafar.

172 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

ANAKIN appears in the doorway of the control center.

NUTE GUNRAY: Welcome, Lord Vader. We've been expecting you.

Everyone in the room looks to him as he raises his hand toward a control panel, and all the exits close. The confused SEPARATISTS look around in bewilderment.

173 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LATE DAY

Smoke from the smoldering shell of the Jedi Temple fills the air with a brown haze.

174 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MAIN ENTRANCE-LATE DAY

A DOZEN CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance of the Jedi Temple. Suddenly there is a flash of a lightsaber, a flurry of confusion, and all of the Clone Troopers are dead on the floor. YODA and OBI-WAN stand in the middle of the carnage.

OBI-WAN: There are several battalions of Clone Troopers on every level. Many are dressed as Jedi.

YODA: Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be.

175 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE BUILDING-SUNSET

The awesome Senate Building looms over the city. The endless traffic continues to clutter the skyline.

176 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET

The Chancellor is in the podium in the center of the vast arena giving a speech. MAS AMEDDA stands to the right of SIDIOUS. BAIL ORGANA walks through the hallway of the Main Senate Chamber. He enters the Senate Pod of Naboo and sits next to PADME. JAR JAR, CAPTAIN TYPHO and TWO HANDMAIDENS are in the pod also.

PALPATINE: . . . and the Jedi Rebellion has been foiled.

BAIL ORGANA: I was held up. What's happening?

PADME: The Chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi, to overthrow the Senate.

BAIL ORGANA: That's not true!

PADME: He's been presenting evidence all afternoon.

BAIL ORGANA: And the Senate will go along with it, just like they always do.

PALPATINE: The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated. (applause) Any collaborators will suffer the same fate.

(applause)

These have been trying times, but we have passed the test.

177 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-SUNSET

YODA and OBI-WAN make their way through the Temple, avoiding the HUNDREDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. They use the Force to distract the CLONES when they can.
YODA and OBI-WAN walk through the ruins of the Temple until they come across the bodies of some students.

OBI-WAN: Not even the younglings survived.

YODA: Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was.

OBI-WAN: . . .Who?? Who could have done this?

178 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber, NUTE and the OTHERS panic. The DROIDS at the controls and the GUARDS grab their weapons, but it is too late. They are cut down in a flash. The Separatists bang on the doors, and NUTE and RUNE HAAKO flee under a table.

ANAKIN, stone-faced, moves through the room like the grim reaper. Bodies drop everywhere. SCREAMS are cut short as the head of the Banking Clan dies.

Then POGGLE THE LESSER loses his head; WAT TAMBOR, SHU MAI, and the REST OF THE SEPARATISTS run into the conference room.

179 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET

PALPATINE: The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger.

Applause.

180 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

In the hallway, ANAKIN cuts down DROIDS and SEPARATISTS alike. He is unstoppable. ANAKIN turns his head-his eyes are yellow.

181 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET

PALPATINE continues his speech at the podium.

PALPATINE: The war is over. (applause) The Separatists have been defeated, (applause) and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning.

There is a long period of APPLAUSE.

PADME: Well, this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the Republic to a democracy.

PALPATINE: In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years.

There is a loud, sustained CHEER from the Senate. BAIL ORGANA and PADME sit, dumbfounded.

PALPATINE: (continuing) An empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . .

The Senate CHEERS again. BAIL and PADME are devastated. PADME begins to cry.

PALPATINE: (continuing) An empire ruled by the majority . . . Ruled by a new constitution . . .

The Senate APPLAUDS.

PADME: So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause . . .

BAIL ORGANA: We cannot let this happen.

He starts to stand up. PADME stops him.

PADME: Not now! There will be a time.

182 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-CONFERENCE ROOM-DAY

After everyone in the Main Control Room is dead, ANAKIN moves to the small conference room where WAT TAMBOR. SHU MAI, and some OTHER SEPARATISTS are hiding. RUNE HAAKO tries to run but is trapped by a dead-end as ANAKIN advances.

RUNE HAAKO: Stop! Enough, this is not right!

RUNE is cut down. NUTE GUNRAY crawls out from under the table and opens the Main Door, allowing DESTROYER DROIDS to enter. WAT TAMBOR is cut down, along with SHU MAI. DESTROYER DROIDS appear in the doorway and blast away, causing total destruction. When the firing is over, ANAKIN is gone. Blown away? No. ANAKIN drops from the ceiling behind the TWO DROIDS and cuts them to pieces before they know what hit them.

183 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-HALLWAY-DAY

NUTE GUNRAY is the last Separatist leader alive. ANAKIN moves on to find NUTE GUNRAY hiding in an alcove.

NUTE GUNRAY: The war is over. Lord Sidious promised us peace ... we only want . . .

NUTE GUNRAY is cut down in midsentence.

184 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COMPUTER ROOM-NIGHT

OBI-WAN stands in a large computer area as YODA looks on, in the hatchway to the Main Control Center.

OBI-WAN: I've recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

YODA: Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry.

185 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-CONTROL CENTER-NIGHT

OBI-WAN enters the Main Control Center with YODA and heads for the hologram area.

OBI-WAN: Wait, Master. There is something I must know . . .

YODA: If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.

OBI-WAN: I must know the truth, Master.

OBI-WAN moves to a panel and flips some switches. He sees a HOLOGRAM of ANAKIN slaughtering JEDI, including the YOUNG ONES. OBI-WAN and YODA react.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) It can't be . . . It can't be . . .

As ANAKIN surveys the carnage, a DARK-ROBED SITH LORD enters. ANAKIN turns to DARTH SIDIOUS and kneels before him.

ANAKIN: The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Good . . . good . . . You have done well, my new apprentice. Do you feel your power growing?

ANAKIN: Yes, My Master.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire.

OBI-WAN watches in horror. Tears well up in his eyes.

OBI-WAN: I can't watch any more.

OBI-WAN switches off the hologram. The TWO JEDI stand in silence for a few moments.

YODA: Destroy the Sith, we must.

OBI-WAN: Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin.

YODA: To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.

OBI-WAN: He is like my brother ... I cannot do it.

YODA: Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader.

OBI-WAN: How could it have come to this?

YODA: To question, no time there is.

OBI-WAN: I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look.

YODA: Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN: May the Force be with you, Master Yoda.

186 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-AFTERNOON

A DC0052 Intergalactic Speeder pulls up to the veranda landing of Padme's apartment.

187 EXT. CORUSCANT -PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-AFTERNOON

The cockpit of the sleek yellow Galactic Speeder opens, and a HOODED FIGURE emerges and walks onto the veranda. An ALARM GOES OFF deep in the apartment. The FIGURE stops before a security curtain that protects the veranda. C-3PO enters the veranda and approaches the FIGURE.

C-3PO: Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it's you, Master Kenobi. Come in, quickly.

The security curtain disappears, and the FIGURE lifts his hood. It is OBI-WAN. The alarm stops sounding.

OBI-WAN: Has Anakin been here . . . ?

C-3PO: Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.

PADME comes down the stairs in a robe. THREEPIO leaves.

PADME: Master Kenobi . . .

She embraces Obi-Wan.

PADME: (continuing) Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you're alive.

OBI-WAN: The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . .

PADME: I know, it's hard to believe everything to which we've dedicated our lives is gone.

OBI-WAN: I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making.

PADME: The Senate is still intact, there is some hope.

OBI-WAN: No. Padme . . . It's over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the Republic.

PADME: The Sith!?!

OBI-WAN: I'm here looking for Anakin . . . When was the last time you saw him?

PADME: Yesterday.

OBI-WAN: And do you know where he is now?

PADME: (looks down) No.

OBI-WAN: Padme, I need your help. He's in grave danger.

PADME: From the Sith?

OBI-WAN: From himself . . . Padme, Anakin has turned to the dark side.

PADME: You're wrong! How could you even say that?

OBI-WAN: I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.

PADME: Not Anakin! He couldn't!

OBI-WAN: He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith Lord we've been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.

PADME: I don't believe you ... I can't.

OBI-WAN: Padme, I must find him.

PADME: You're going to kill him, aren't you?

OBI-WAN: He has become a very great threat.

As PADME moves to sit down, she reveals her pregnancy.

PADME: I can't . . .

OBI-WAN: Anakin is the father, isn't he?

PADME looks away.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) I'm so sorry.

OBI-WAN turns and leaves as PADME stares transfixed, not knowing what to do. She is worried and tormented. OBI-WAN takes off in the Speeder. She studies the japor snippet that is hanging around her neck.

ANAKIN stares out at Mustafar, standing on the control room balcony.

191 EXT. CORUSCANT-LANDING PLATFORM-SUNSET

A small Naboo Skiff rests on a landing platform in the vast congestion of Coruscant. PADME gets out of her Speeder, followed by CAPTAIN TYPHO and C-3PO.

CAPTAIN TYPHO: My Lady, let me come with you.

PADME: There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal.

TYPHO bows.

CAPTAIN TYPHO: As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree.

PADME: I'll be all right, Captain.

He goes to the speeder and gets in.

PADME: (continuing) This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me.

C-3PO: Oh, dear.

TYPHO takes off and PADME and THREEPIO board the small NABOO SKIFF. A shadow moves out from under the SKIFF. It is OBI-WAN. He quickly jumps on the retracting ramp as the SKIFF takes off.

192 INT. NABOO SKIFF

THREEPIO chatters away as PADME breaks down in tears, the painful reality sinking in.

C-3PO: Green light. Do you know that I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business.

OBI-WAN stows away on Padme's ship. The ship lifts from the landing platform and heads into the traffic lanes.

193 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-SUNSET

A HOLOGRAM OF ANAKIN appears before PALPATINE in his office at the bottom of the Senate Arena.

DARTH VADER: The Separatists are taken care of, My Master.

DARTH SlDIOUS: It is finished, then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy. You have done well, Lord Vader.

DARTH VADER: Thank you, My Master.

194 INT. MUSTAFAR-COXFERENCE ROOM-DAY

A Hologram of Sidious speaks with Anakin in the Mustafar control room.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation. Tell them the Separatist leaders have been wiped out. Grievous and Dooku have been destroyed. All droid units must shut down immediately.

DARTH VADER: Very good, My Lord.

ANAKIN sees Padme's ship arriving on the screen and goes out to meet her.

195 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The sleek NABOO SKIFF lands on the Mustafar landing platform near Anakin's GREEN STARFIGHTER. ANAKIN runs up to the SKIFF as the ramp lowers. PADME runs to him.

ANAKIN: Padme, I saw your ship . . .

They embrace.

PADME: Oh, Anakin!

ANAKIN: It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here?

PADME: I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

ANAKIN: What things?

PADME: He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.

ANAKIN: Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.

PADME: He cares about us.

ANAKIN: Us??!

PADME: He knows . . . He wants to help you.

ANAKIN: Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough.

PADME: Anakin, all I want is your love.

ANAKIN: Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.

PADME: At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this.

ANAKIN: I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you.

PADME: Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.

ANAKIN: Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.

PADME: I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.

ANAKIN: I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.

PADME: I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I
can't follow.

ANAKIN: Because of Obi-Wan?

PADME: Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.

ANAKIN: (seeing Obi-Wan) Liar!

PADME turns around and. sees OBI-WAN standing in the doorway of the Naboo Cruiser.

PADME: No!

ANAKIN: You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me!

PADME: NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...

ANAKIN reaches out, and PADME grabs her throat as she starts to choke.

OBI-WAN: Let her go, Anakin.

ANAKIN: What have you and she been up to?

OBI-WAN: Let her go!

ANAKIN releases his grip on the unconscious PADME and she crumples to the ground.

ANAKIN: You turned her against me.

OBI-WAN: You have done that yourself.

ANAKIN: You will not take her from me.

ANAKIN throws off his cloak.

OBI-WAN: Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.

OBI-WAN flings off his cloak.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now . . . until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.

They circle each other until OBI-WAN is near PADME. He places his hand on her.

ANAKIN: Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.

OBI-WAN: Your new Empire?

ANAKIN: Don't make me kill you.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... to democracy.

ANAKIN: If you're not with me, you're my enemy.

OBI-WAN: Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.

(ignites his lightsaber)

ANAKIN: You will try.

ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.

ANAKIN lashes out at OBI-WAN, and they begin a ferocious sword fight. ANAKIN throws CONTAINERS at OBI-WAN using the Force.
They work their way off the landing platform and into the main entry hallway. ANAKIN kicks OBI-WAN, and OBI-WAN drops to a lower level.
ARTOO BEEPS his concern and rushes to the unconscious PADME's aid.

196 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-NIGHT

YODA enters, using the Force to throw two RED GUARDS against the wall, knocking them unconscious. DARTH SIDIOUS turns his chair toward YODA. MAS AMEDDA stands behind SIDIOUS's desk.

YODA: I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Master Yoda, you survived.

YODA: Surprised?

DARTH SlDIOUS: Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda. Now you will experience the full power of the dark side.

The Dark Lord raises his arms, and LIGHTNING BOLTS shoot out, surrounding YODA.
YODA is picked up and thrown across the room, hitting the wall and sliding down in a crumpled heap. DARTH SIDIOUS chuckles.

197 INT. MUSTAFAR-PASSAGES TO MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move their fight toward the main control center. As the laser swords fly, bits of the hallway are cut up. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump and use every trick in the Jedi book.

R2-D2, tries to drag PADME on board the Naboo Cruiser. C-3PO pokes his head out of the ship's doorway.

C-3PO starts down the ramp.

199 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-NIGHT

MAS AMEDDA leaves the room. PALPATINE approaches a stunned YODA.

DARTH SlDIOUS: I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend. At last, the Jedi are no more.

YODA: Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious.

YODA uses the Force to throw DARTH SIDIOUS back, knocking him clear over his desk and onto the floor in a heap.

YODA: (continuing) At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say.

DARTH SIDIOUS flies through the air, cape flapping, heading toward the exit. At the last second, YODA flies into the exit and stops the Dark Lord.

YODA: (continuing) If so powerful you are, why leave??

YODA ignites his lightsaber.

DARTH SlDIOUS: You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.

DARTH SIDIOUS ignites his lightsaber.

YODA: Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.

Their swords CLASH. The battle is extremely fast and furious.


200 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

View screens EXPLODE around ANAKIN and OBI-WAN as they work their way into the Control Room. The fighting is intense. OBI-WAN is on the defensive as he jumps up on the table view screen in the center of the room.

ANAKIN: Don't make me destroy you, Master. You're no match for the dark side.

OBI-WAN: I've heard that before, Anakin . . . but I never thought I'd hear it from you.

ANAKIN forces OBI-WAN back into the Conference Room where the quarters are much closer. Sparks fly everywhere. ANAKIN jumps onto the conference table. OBI-WAN slides across the table, knocking ANAKIN over. OBI-WAN grabs ANAKIN s lightsaber as he falls. OBI-WAN uses the Force to summon his dropped lightsaber. ANAKIN does the same.

202 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

The battle intensifies.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) The flaw of power is arrogance.

OBI-WAN stands looking at his former apprentice for a moment.

ANAKIN: You hesitate . . . the flaw of compassion.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lock sabers. OBI-WAN puts out his hand to use the Force to push ANAKIN away. ANAKIN puts out his hand to block OBI-WAN.
Both combatants are blasted backwards onto the control panels.
They regain their footing and the battle continues. ANAKIN kicks OBI-WAN away.
They battle around the room, and eventually the door to the exterior is knocked open. They continue battling out onto the balcony.

203 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMRER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT

YODA unleashes a ferocious assault on PALPATINE, causing him to almost go over the edge. The Dark Lord drops his lightsaber but recovers with a BLAST OF ENERGY from his hands that surrounds YODA. YODA is deflecting the Sith Lord's lightning bolts.

The energy bolts begin to arc back on the Emperor. It looks as if the Dark Lord is doomed.

YODA: Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy.

YODA jumps to a lower Senate Pod. PALPATINE reaches out with one hand, and a Senate pod is released from its mooring and heads toward the Podium. PALPATINE uses the Force to hurl pod after pod at YODA, who ducks and jumps from one flying pod to another.

YODA leaps away from the pods. He uses the Force to hold one pod suspended in the air. The pod spins and YODA throws it back at PALPATINE, who leaps away at the last moment.

YODA leaps after him, but PALPATINE quickly turns and aims the full force of his energy bolts at the tiny green Jedi, catching him in mid-air and throwing him back hard against the Podium. The force causes YODA to drop his lightsaber. YODA blocks the lightning and throws PALPATINE backwards off the podium. YODA is knocked off the Podium and falls several hundred feet to the base of the Podium. PALPATINE follows in his pod, searching for YODA.

ANAKIN forces OBI-WAN down a narrow balcony outside the Control Room. He rips objects off the wall and throws them at OBI-WAN as he pushes him further and further along the walkway.

The balcony ends, and OBI-WAN is trapped. He looks over the balcony and into a river of lava.

ANAKIN cuts apiece of the balcony railing off, along with a control panel.
ALARMS SOUND, and a protective ray shield around the superstructure disappears. It tumbles into the molten abyss, disappearing in a puff of smoke. A small pipe connects the Control Center to the Main Collection Plant. OBI-WAN has no choice but to tightrope-walk out across the lava river while fighting ANAKIN.

They continue to fight across the pipe until they reach the Main Collection Plant.

207 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-WIRING CHUTE-NIGHT

YODA squishes his way through a mass of wires in a small chute. He talks on his comlink.

208 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT

A Senate pod with COMMANDER THIRE (4477) and SEVERAL OTHER CLONE TROOPERS climb up to where MAS AMEDDA and PALPATINE are waiting. Beneath the Main Podium, TWENTY CLONE TROOPERS search for Yoda 's body.

CLONE COMMANDER THIRE: There is no sign of his body, sir.

MAS AMEDDA: Then he is not dead.

PALPATINE: Double your search.

CLONE COMMANDER THIRE: Yes sir. Right away, sir.

PALPATINE: (to Mas Amedda) Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate takeoff.

MAS AMEDDA: Yes, Master.

PALPATINE: I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

PALPATINE walks into the Arena hallway. COMMANDER THIRE descends down to the floor of the Arena, where an intense search is taking place. SEVERAL CURIOUS SENATORS rubberneck in scattered pods.

209 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN battle on the top of the multispired collection panels, jumping from one to the other. At the end of the collection cluster, a huge spray of lava covers the attachments that hold up the collectors. The frame begins to melt. It's raining lava. Both ANAKIN and OBI-WAN run for cover under the collection cluster. They continue to fight in the lava rain, darting from cover to attack, then quickly retreating to cover.
Support for the entire structure begins to fall away, and the collection cluster falls into the lava river. The Jedi continue their fight, climbing to the highest point on the tower as the rest begins to melt away as it rides the swift current down the river.

It bends toward the lava as they get out toward the end. The fighting gets fierce. OBI-WAN gets to the end and is trapped. The tower slowly starts to sink under the lava.

210 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-NIGHT

BAIL ORGANA, in his open Cockpit Speeder, flies along next to the roof eave of the huge Senate Building. He slows and moves closer to a long row of recessed lights. Suddenly YODA falls out of one of the light recesses and lands in the Speeder. BAIL guns it and heads away from the Senate Building.

211 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA'S SPEEDER-NIGHT

YODA and BAIL fly into the traffic of the city.

212 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY

OBI-WAN realizes he is getting very close to the edge of the lava falls. He grabs a rope and leaps from the collection arm. ANAKIN follows.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their sword fight hanging from cables as they swing past each other.

213 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY

C-3PO carefully lifts PADME into his arms. R2-D2 nervously looks on. BEEPING.

C-3PO: I am being careful. I've got a good hold on her, but . . . I'm worried about my back. I hope it's able to hold up under this weight.

C-3PO carries PADME into the Naboo Skiff.

214 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY

From their cables, ANAKIN and OBI-WAN both spot something that causes them to stop fighting. The lava river ahead drops off in a tremendous lava fall.

SNAPPING AND METAL GROANS are heard as the main part of the collector starts to break away and move toward the lava fall. OBI-WAN looks around and sees a small floating platform making its way toward the tower.

OBI-WAN does a double hack-flip and lands squarely on the floating platform. He immediately leans to one side and moves away from the tower.

ANAKIN realizes he is doomed as the entire tower heads for the falls. In the distance he sees some CONSTRUCTION DROIDS. He swings back to the tower, climbs up and makes a running leap and miraculously lands on A WORKER DROID. The DROID is confused and chatters to his CO-WORKER. The giant collector goes over the lava flow and disappears in the mist of sparks below.

OBI-WAN heads for the bank of the lava river, but Anakin's DROID is faster. He catches up with his old Master.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue the swordfight. They battle away, balancing on the tiny platform and puzzled DROID. ANAKIN, standing on the Droid, approaches OBI-WAN on the work platform.

OBI-WAN: I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think.

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN confront each other on the lava river.

ANAKIN: I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .

OBI-WAN: From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil.

ANAKIN: From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil.

OBI-WAN: Well, then you are lost!

ANAKIN: This is the end for you, My Master. I wish it were otherwise.

ANAKIN jumps and flips onto OBI- WAN's platform. The fighting continues again until OBI-WAN jumps toward the safety of the black sandy edge of the lava river. He yells at Anakin.

OBI-WAN: It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.

ANAKIN: You underestimate my power!

OBI-WAN: Don't try it.

ANAKIN follows, and OBI-WAN cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. ANAKIN tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the lava.

ANAKIN struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. His thin leather glove has been burned off. He keeps sliding down in the black sand.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.

OBI-WAN picks up Anakin's light saber and begins to walk away. He stops and looks back.

ANAKIN: I hate you!

OBI-WAN: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.

ANAKIN'S clothing blows into the lava river and ignites. Suddenly ANAKIN bursts into flames and starts SCREAMING.

215 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY

OBI-WAN looks in horror as ANAKIN becomes engulfed in flames. OBI-WAN can't watch him as he struggles to climb the embankment, covered in flames.

He runs back to Padme's ship as ANAKIN drops, smoldering, near the top of the lava pit.

216 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY

OBI-WAN makes his way to the SKIFF. He looks for Padme. THREEPIO sticks his head out the door of the SKIFF.

C-3PO: Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place.

OBI-WAN runs on board the Naboo Skiff.

217 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY

PADME lies on a cot or bed inside the ship. OBI-WAN walks over and checks on her.

PADME: Obi-Wan? Is Anakin all right?

OBI-WAN looks at her sadly and does not answer. He brushes her hair back. Padme drops back into unconsciousness. ARTOO watches over her.
OBI-WAN rides in the co-pilot's station. He sits looking pensive. THREEPIO drives.

218 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY

ANAKIN crawls up the bank, his body smoking. A shuttle flies overhead and lands.

219 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-IMPERIAL SHUTTLE-DAY

DARTH SIDIOUS discovers what remains of ANAKIN and checks him out. He turns to the CLONES.

DARTH SIDIOUS: Anakin! Anakin! There he is. He's still alive. Get a medical capsule, immediately.

CLONE CAPTAIN: Yes sir. Right away.

Several of the CLONES rush off as DARTH SIDlOUS puts his hand on ANAKIN's forehead.

222 INT. POLIS MASSA-OBSERVATION DOME-NIGHT

On the isolated asteroid of Polis Massa, YODA meditates.

YODA: Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ...

QUI -GON: (V.O.) Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith.

YODA: Eternal consciousness.

QUI-GON: (V.O.) The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed.

YODA: . . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.

QUI-GON: (V.O.) You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no thought of self. No physical self.

YODA: A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.

YODA thinks about this for a minute, then BAIL ORGANA enters the room and breaks his meditation.

BAIL ORGANA: Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

223 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The CLONES have placed ANAKIN in a medical capsule. They float the wounded Sith Lord into the belly of the IMPERIAL CRUISER. DARTH SIDIOUS follows the capsule into the ship. The ship takes off.

224 EXT. POLIS MASSA-LANDING PLATFORM-NIGHT

OBI-WAN lands the Naboo Cruiser on the landing platform of the isolated post of Polis Massa. YODA and BAIL ORGANA, along with a FEW GROUND CREW, are waiting as the ramp lowers and OBI-WAN emerges, carrying the unconscious PADME in his arms, followed by ARTOO and THREEPIO.

BAIL ORGANA: We'll take her to the medical center, quickly.

225 EXT. LANDING PLATFORM-CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY

The shuttle lands. DARTH SIDIOUS and CLONE TROOPERS leave the shuttle. ANAKIN's body is carried along in a floating medical capsule.

226 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT

POLIS MEDICS work, on PADME in an operating theater. OBI-WAN and one of the MEDICAL DROIDS enter an observation room where BAIL and YODA are waiting.

MEDICAL DROID: Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.

OBI-WAN: She's dying?

MEDICAL DROID: We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.

BAIL ORGANA: Babies??!!

MEDICAL DROID: She's carrying twins.

YODA: Save them, we must. They are our last hope.

The MEDICAL DROID rushes back to the operating room. ARTOO and THREEPIO watch, greatly puzzled. ARTOO BEEPS.

C-3PO: It s some kind of reproductive process, I think.

227 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY

ANAKIN, in the medical capsule, is lifted onto a table in the Rehab Center. DROIDS go to work on him. ANAKIN has new legs and a new arm.

228 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT

The TWINS are being delivered as BAIL ORGANA, YODA, ARTOO, and THREEPIO watch. OBI-WAN is in the operating theater with PADME. He takes her hand.

OBI-WAN: Don't give up, Padme.

PADME winces from the pain. The MEDICAL DROID is holding the BABY.

MEDICAL DROID: It's a boy.

PADME: Luke . . .

PADME can only offer up a faint smile. She struggles to touch the baby on the forehead.

MEDICAL DROID: ... and a girl.

PADME: . . . Leia.

R2-D2, THREEPIO and BAIL ORGANA watch from an adjoining space.

229 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY

VADER, dressed in his black body armor, lies on the table. Nose plugs are inserted and the mask drops from above, sealing tightly. The helmet is fitted and VADER begins breathing.

230 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT

OBI WAN leans over PADME and softly speaks to her.

OBI-WAN: You have twins, Padme They need you . . . hang on.

PADME: I can't . . .

PADME winces again and takes OBI-WAN's hand. She is holding Anakin's japor snippet.

OBI-WAN: Save your energy.

PADME: Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is ... still . . .

A last gasp, and she dies. Obi-Wan studies the necklace.

231 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY

DARTH SIDIOUS hovers around the periphery of a group of MEDICAL DROIDS who are working on ANAKIN. DARTH SIDIOUS paces in the foreground. A DROID approaches the Dark Lord.

MEDICAL DROID: My Lord, the construction is finished ... he lives.

DARTH SIDIOUS: Good. Good.

The DROID moves back to the table where DARTH VADER lies. The table begins to move upright. DARTH SIDIOUS moves in next to DARTH VADER.

DARTH SIDIOUS: (continuing) Lord Vader, can you hear me?

DARTH VADER, with his dark mask and helmet, moves up into the frame until he is in a CLOSEUP.

DARTH VADER: Yes, My Master.

DARTH VADER looks around the room.

DARTH VADER: (continuing) Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all right?

DARTH SIDIOUS moves closer to the half droid half man.

DARTH SIDIOUS: I'm afraid she died. ... it seems in your anger, you killed her.

A LOW GROAN emanates from Vader's mask. Suddenly everything in the room begins to implode, including some of the DROIDS.

DARTH VADER: I couldn't have! She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It's impossible! No!!!

VADER SCREAMS, breaks his bonds to the table, and steps forward, waving his hands, causing objects to fly around the room. SIDIOUS deflects the objects, but some of the DROIDS aren't so lucky. VADER'S PAINFUL SCREAMS echo throughout the Center.

YODA: Split up, they should be.

BAIL ORGANA: My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.

OBI-WAN: And what of the boy?

YODA: To Tatooine. To his family, send him.

OBI-WAN: I will take the child and watch over him. Master Yoda, do you think Anakin's twins will be able to defeat Darth Sidious?

YODA: Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will.

BAIL leaves the conference room. YODA stops OBI-WAN.

YODA: (continuing) Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.

OBI-WAN: Training??

YODA: An old friend has learned the path to immortality.

OBI-WAN: Who?

YODA: One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.

OBI-WAN: Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?

YODA: The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.

OBI-WAN: I will be able to talk with him?

YODA: How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps.

BAIL ORGANA, followed by ARTOO and THREEPIO, approaches CAPTAIN ANTILLES and TWO CREW MEMBERS.

American Heritage Dictionary: New College Edition

INT. COFFEE SHOP   MORNING

A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.
It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed,
there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching
on bacon and eating eggs.

Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The
Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and,
like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're
going out of style.

It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or
how old she is; everything she does contradicts something
she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is
to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

YOUNG MAN
No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm
through doin' that shit.

YOUNG WOMAN
You always say that, the same thing
every time: never again, I'm through,
too dangerous.

YOUNG MAN
I know that's what I always say. I'm
always right too, but  

YOUNG WOMAN
  but you forget about it in a day
or two -

YOUNG MAN
  yeah, well, the days of me
forgittin' are over, and the days of
me rememberin' have just begun.

YOUNG WOMAN
When you go on like this, you know
what you sound like?

YOUNG MAN
I sound like a sensible fucking man,
is what I sound like.

YOUNG WOMAN
You sound like a duck.
(imitates a duck)
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack...

YOUNG MAN
Well take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna hafta hear it again. Because
since I'm never gonna do it again,
you're never gonna hafta hear me
quack about how I'm never gonna do
it again.

YOUNG WOMAN
After tonight.

The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in
there, back and forth.

YOUNG MAN
(with a smile)
Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

WAITRESS
Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh yes, thank you.

The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man
lights up another cigarette.

YOUNG MAN
I'm doin' fine.

The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his
smoke.

The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her
coffee.

The Young Man goes right back into it.

YOUNG MAN
I mean the way it is now, you're
takin' the same fuckin' risk as when
you rob a bank. You take more of a
risk. Banks are easier!  Federal
banks aren't supposed to stop you
anyway, during a robbery. They're
insured, why should they care? You
don't even need a gun in a federal
bank. I heard about this guy, walked
into a federal bank with a portable
phone, handed the phone to the teller,
the guy on the other end of the phone
said: "We got this guy's little girl,
and if you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill 'er."

YOUNG WOMAN
Did it work?

YOUNG MAN
Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm
talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in
a bank with a telephone, not a pistol,
not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone,
cleans the place out, and they don't
lift a fuckin' finger.

YOUNG WOMAN
Did they hurt the little girl?

YOUNG MAN
I don't know. There probably never
was a little girl   the point of the
story isn't the little girl. The
point of the story is they robbed
the bank with a telephone.

YOUNG WOMAN
You wanna rob banks?

YOUNG MAN
I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks,
I'm just illustrating that if we
did, it would be easier than what we
been doin'.

YOUNG WOMAN
So you don't want to be a bank robber?

YOUNG MAN
Naw, all those guys are goin' down
the same road, either dead or servin'
twenty.

YOUNG WOMAN
And no more liquor stores?

YOUNG MAN
What have we been talking about?
Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides,
it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too
many foreigners own liquor stores.
Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't
fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:
"Empty out the register," and they
don't know what it fuckin' means.
They make it too personal. We keep
on, one of those gook motherfuckers'
gonna make us kill 'em.

YOUNG WOMAN
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

YOUNG MAN
I don't wanna kill anybody either.
But they'll probably put us in a
situation where it's us of them. And
if it's not the gooks, it these old
Jews who've owned the store for
fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got
Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the
counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try
walkin' into one of those stores
with nothin' but a telephone, see
how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget
it, we're out of it.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well, what else is there, day jobs?

YOUNG MAN
(laughing)
Not this life.

YOUNG WOMAN
Well what then?

He calls to the Waitress.

YOUNG MAN
Garcon! Coffee!

Then looks to his girl.

YOUNG MAN
This place.

The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

WAITRESS
(snotty)
"Garcon" means boy.

She splits.

YOUNG WOMAN
Here? It's a coffee shop.

YOUNG MAN
What's wrong with that? People never
rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor
stores, gas stations, you get your
head blown off stickin' up one of
them. Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.
They're not expecting to get robbed,
or not as expecting.

YOUNG WOMAN
(taking to idea)
I bet in places like this you could
cut down on the hero factor.

YOUNG MAN
Correct. Just like banks, these places
are insured. The managers don't give
a fuck, they're just tryin' to get
ya out the door before you start
pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget
it, they ain't takin' a bullet for
the register. Busboys, some wetback
gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour
gonna really give a fuck you're
stealin' from the owner. Customers
are sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin'
on. One minute they're havin' a Denver
omelet, next minute somebody's
stickin' a gun in their face.

The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man
continues in a low voice.

YOUNG MAN
See, I got the idea last liquor store
we stuck up. 'Member all those
customers kept comin' in?

YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah.

YOUNG MAN
Then you got the idea to take
everybody's wallet.

YOUNG WOMAN
Uh-huh.

YOUNG MAN
That was a good idea.

YOUNG WOMAN
Thanks.

YOUNG MAN
We made more from the wallets then
we did the register.

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes we did.

YOUNG MAN
A lot of people go to restaurants.

YOUNG WOMAN
A lot of wallets.

YOUNG MAN
Pretty smart, huh?

The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new
information.

She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The
tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the
motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the
COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's
face.

YOUNG WOMAN
Pretty smart.
(into it)
I'm ready, let's go, right here,
right now.

YOUNG MAN
Remember, same as before, you're
crowd control, I handle the employees.

YOUNG WOMAN
Got it.

They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on
the table. He looks at her and she back at him.

YOUNG WOMAN
I love you, Pumpkin.

YOUNG MAN
I love you, Honey Bunny.

And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons,
stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona
is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is
that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

PUMPKIN
(yelling to all)
Everybody be cool this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
I'll execute every one of you
motherfuckers!  Got that?

"PULP FICTION"

INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING)   MORNING

An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS
down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front
seat are two young fellas   one white, one black   both
wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long
green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES
WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

JULES
  Okay now, tell me about the hash
bars?

VINCENT
What so you want to know?

JULES
Well, hash is legal there, right?

VINCENT
Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a
hundred percent legal. I mean you
can't walk into a restaurant, roll a
joint, and start puffin' away. You're
only supposed to smoke in your home
or certain designated places.

JULES
Those are hash bars?

VINCENT
Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's
legal to buy it, it's legal to own
it and, if you're the proprietor of
a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
It's legal to carry it, which doesn't
really matter 'cause   get a load of
this   if the cops stop you, it's
illegal for this to search you.
Searching you is a right that the
cops in Amsterdam don't have.

JULES
That did it, man   I'm fuckin' goin',
that's all there is to it.

VINCENT
You'll dig it the most. But you know
what the funniest thing about Europe
is?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
It's the little differences. A lotta
the same shit we got here, they got
there, but there they're a little
different.

JULES
Examples?

VINCENT
Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer
in a movie theatre. And I don't mean
in a paper cup either. They give you
a glass of beer, like in a bar. In
Paris, you can buy beer at
MacDonald's. Also, you know what
they call a Quarter Pounder with
Cheese in Paris?

JULES
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder
with Cheese?

VINCENT
No, they got the metric system there,
they wouldn't know what the fuck a
Quarter Pounder is.

JULES
What'd they call it?

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
(repeating)
Royale with Cheese. What'd they call
a Big Mac?

VINCENT
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call
it Le Big Mac.

JULES
Le Big Mac. What do they call a
Whopper?

VINCENT
I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger
King.  But you know what they put on
french fries in Holland instead of
ketchup?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
Mayonnaise.

JULES
Goddamn!

VINCENT
I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a
little bit on the side of the plate,
they fuckin' drown 'em in it.

JULES
Uuccch!

CUT TO:

INT. CHEVY (TRUNK)   MORNING

The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach
inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking
them.

JULES
We should have shotguns for this
kind of deal.

VINCENT
How many up there?

JULES
Three or four.

VINCENT
Counting our guy?

JULES
I'm not sure.

VINCENT
So there could be five guys up there?

JULES
It's possible.

VINCENT
We should have fuckin' shotguns.

They CLOSE the trunk.

CUT TO:

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD   MORNING

Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically
dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what
looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

We TRACK alongside.

VINCENT
What's her name?

JULES
Mia.

VINCENT
How did Marsellus and her meet?

JULES
I dunno, however people meet people.
She usta be an actress.

VINCENT
She ever do anything I woulda saw?

JULES
I think her biggest deal was she
starred in a pilot.

VINCENT
What's a pilot?

JULES
Well, you know the shows on TV?

VINCENT
I don't watch TV.

JULES
Yes, but you're aware that there's
an invention called television, and
on that invention they show shows?

VINCENT
Yeah.

JULES
Well, the way they pick the shows on
TV is they make one show, and that
show's called a pilot. And they show
that one show to the people who pick
the shows, and on the strength of
that one show, they decide if they
want to make more shows. Some get
accepted and become TV programs, and
some don't, and become nothing. She
starred in one of the ones that became
nothing.

They enter the apartment building.

INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING)   MORNING

Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait
for the elevator.

JULES
You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half-
black, half-Samoan, usta call him
Tony Rocky Horror.

VINCENT
Yeah maybe, fat right?

JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call the
brother fat. He's got a weight
problem.  What's the nigger gonna
do, he's Samoan.

VINCENT
I think I know who you mean, what
about him?

JULES
Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up
good.  And word around the campfire,
it was on account of Marsellus
Wallace's wife.

The elevator arrives, the men step inside.

INT. ELEVATOR   MORNING

VINCENT
What'd he do, fuck her?

JULES
No no no no no no no, nothin' that
bad.

VINCENT
Well what then?

JULES
He gave her a foot massage.

VINCENT
A foot massage?

Jules nods his head: "Yes."

VINCENT
That's all?

Jules nods his head: "Yes."

VINCENT
What did Marsellus do?

JULES
Sent a couple of guys over to his
place.  They took him out on the
patio of his apartment, threw his
ass over the balcony.  Nigger fell
four stories. They had this garden
at the bottom, enclosed in glass,
like one of them greenhouses   nigger
fell through that. Since then, he's
kinda developed a speech impediment.

The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.

VINCENT
That's a damn shame.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY   MORNING

STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline
down the hall.

VINCENT
Still I hafta say, play with matches,
ya get burned.

JULES
Whaddya mean?

VINCENT
You don't be givin' Marsellus
Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

JULES
You don't think he overreacted?

VINCENT
Antwan probably didn't expect
Marsellus to react like he did, but
he had to expect a reaction.

JULES
It was a foot massage, a foot massage
is nothing, I give my mother a foot
massage.

VINCENT
It's laying hands on Marsellus
Wallace's new wife in a familiar
way. Is it as bad as eatin' her out
  no, but you're in the same fuckin'
ballpark.

Jules stops Vincent.

JULES
Whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right
there.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin'
a bitch a foot massage ain't even
the same fuckin' thing.

VINCENT
Not the same thing, the same ballpark.

JULES
It ain't no ballpark either. Look
maybe your method of massage differs
from mine, but touchin' his lady's
feet, and stickin' your tongue in
her holyiest of holyies, ain't the
same ballpark, ain't the same league,
ain't even the same fuckin' sport.
Foot massages don't mean shit.

VINCENT
Have you ever given a foot massage?

JULES
Don't be tellin' me about foot
massages   I'm the foot fuckin'
master.

VINCENT
Given a lot of 'em?

JULES
Shit yeah. I got my technique down
man, I don't tickle or nothin'.

VINCENT
Have you ever given a guy a foot
massage?

Jules looks at him a long moment   he's been set up.

JULES
Fuck you.

He starts walking down the hall.  Vincent, smiling, walks a
little bit behind.

VINCENT
How many?

JULES
Fuck you.

VINCENT
Would you give me a foot massage  
I'm kinda tired.

JULES
Man, you best back off, I'm gittin'
pissed   this is the door.

The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49." They
whisper.

JULES
What time is it?

VINCENT
(checking his watch)
Seven-twenty-two in the morning.

JULES
It ain't quite time, let's hang back.

They move a little away from the door, facing each other,
still whispering.

JULES
Look, just because I wouldn't give
no man a foot massage, don't make it
right for Marsellus to throw Antwan
off a building into a glass-
motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the
way the nigger talks. That ain't
right, man. Motherfucker do that to
me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause
I'd kill'a motherfucker.

VINCENT
I'm not sayin' he was right, but
you're sayin' a foot massage don't
mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does.
I've given a million ladies a million
foot massages and they all meant
somethin'. We act like they don't,
but they do. That's what's so fuckin'
cool about 'em. This sensual thing's
goin' on that nobody's talkin about,
but you know it and she knows it,
fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan
shoulda known fuckin' better. That's
his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna
have a sense of humor about that
shit.

JULES
That's an interesting point, but
let's get into character.

VINCENT
What's her name again?

JULES
Mia. Why you so interested in big
man's wife?

VINCENT
Well, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida
and when he's gone, he wants me to
take care of Mia.

JULES
Take care of her?

Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.

VINCENT
Not that! Take her out. Show her a
good time. Don't let her get lonely.

JULES
You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace
out on a date?

VINCENT
It ain't a date. It's like when you
and your buddy's wife go to a movie
or somethin'. It's just... you know...
good company.

Jules just looks at him.

VINCENT
It's not a date.

Jules just looks at him.

INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49)   MORNING

THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a
table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to
REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

JULES
Hey kids.

The two men stroll inside.

The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the
scene progresses, back into the corner.

ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of
Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the
table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in
their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

JULES
How you boys doin'?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Am I trippin', or did I just ask you
a question.

BRETT
We're doin' okay.

As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

JULES
Do you know who we are?

Brett shakes his head: "No."

JULES
We're associates of your business
partner Marsellus Wallace, you
remember your business partner
dont'ya?

No answer.

JULES
(to Brett)
Now I'm gonna take a wild guess here:
you're Brett, right?

BRETT
I'm Brett.

JULES
I thought so. Well, you remember
your business partner Marsellus
Wallace, dont'ya Brett?

BRETT
I remember him.

JULES
Good for you. Looks like me and
Vincent caught you at breakfast,
sorry 'bout that.  What'cha eatin'?

BRETT
Hamburgers.

JULES
Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any
nutritious breakfast. What kinda
hamburgers?

BRETT
Cheeseburgers.

JULES
No, I mean where did you get'em?
MacDonald's, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-
Box, where?

BRETT
Big Kahuna Burger.

JULES
Big Kahuna Burger. That's that
Hawaiian burger joint. I heard they
got some tasty burgers. I ain't never
had one myself, how are they?

BRETT
They're good.

JULES
Mind if I try one of yours?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Yours is this one, right?

BRETT
Yeah.

Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

JULES
Uuummmm, that's a tasty burger.
(to Vincent)
Vince, you ever try a Big Kahuna
Burger?

VINCENT
No.

Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

JULES
You wanna bite, they're real good.

VINCENT
I ain't hungry.

JULES
Well, if you like hamburgers give
'em a try sometime. Me, I can't
usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's
a vegetarian. Which more or less
makes me a vegetarian, but I sure
love the taste of a good burger.
(to Brett)
You know what they call a Quarter
Pounder with Cheese in France?

BRETT
No.

JULES
Tell 'em, Vincent.

VINCENT
Royale with Cheese.

JULES
Royale with Cheese, you know why
they call it that?

BRETT
Because of the metric system?

JULES
Check out the big brain on Brett.
You'a smart motherfucker, that's
right. The metric system.
(he points to a fast
food drink cup)
What's in this?

BRETT
Sprite.

JULES
Sprite, good, mind if I have some of
your tasty beverage to wash this
down with?

BRETT
Sure.

Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

JULES
Uuuuummmm, hit's the spot!
(to Roger)
You, Flock of Seagulls, you know
what we're here for?

Roger nods his head: "Yes."

JULES
Then why don't you tell my boy here
Vince, where you got the shit hid.

MARVIN
It's under the be  

JULES
  I don't remember askin' you a
goddamn thing.
(to Roger)
You were sayin'?

ROGER
It's under the bed.

Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out
a black snap briefcase.

VINCENT
Got it.

Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see
what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent
just stares at it, transfixed.

JULES
We happy?

No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

JULES
Vincent!

Vincent looks up at Jules.

JULES
We happy?

Closing the case.

VINCENT
We're happy.

BRETT
(to Jules)
Look, what's your name? I got his
name's Vincent, but what's yours?

JULES
My name's Pitt, and you ain't talkin'
your ass outta this shit.

BRETT
I just want you to know how sorry we
are about how fucked up things got
between us and Mr. Wallace. When we
entered into this thing, we only had
the best intentions  

As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger
three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering,
but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

JULES
(to Brett)
Oh, I'm sorry. Did that break your
concentration? I didn't mean to do
that.  Please, continue. I believe
you were saying something about "best
intentions."

Brett can't say a word.

JULES
Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through
anyway.  Well, let me retort. Would
you describe for me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like?

Brett still can't speak.

Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing
the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits
in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in
front of an interrogator.

JULES
What country you from!

BRETT
(petrified)
What?

JULES
"What" ain't no country I know! Do
they speak English in "What?"

BRETT
(near heart attack)
What?

JULES
English-motherfucker-can-you-speak-
it?

BRETT
Yes.

JULES
Then you understand what I'm sayin'?

BRETT
Yes.

JULES
Now describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

BRETT
(out of fear)
What?

Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's
cheek.

JULES
Say "What" again! C'mon, say "What"
again!  I dare ya, I double dare ya
motherfucker, say "What" one more
goddamn time!

Brett is regressing on the spot.

JULES
Now describe to me what Marsellus
Wallace looks like!

Brett does his best.

BRETT
Well he's... he's... black  

JULES
  go on!

BRETT
...and he's... he's... bald  

JULES
  does he look like a bitch?!

BRETT
(without thinking)
What?

Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his
eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING TREMBLING SPASM in
the chair.

JULES
Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!

BRETT
(in agony)
No.

JULES
Then why did you try to fuck 'im
like a bitch?!

BRETT
(in spasm)
I didn't.

Now in a lower voice.

JULES
Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck
'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT
(in spasm)
Yes.

JULES
There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of darkness, for he is
truly his brother's keeper and the
finder of lost children. And I will
strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know my name
is the Lord when I lay my vengeance
upon you."

The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting
Brett.

AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD:

"VINCENT VEGA AND MARSELLUS WALLACE'S WIFE"

FADE IN:

MEDIUM SHOT   BUTCH COOLIDGE

We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old
prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue
high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is
everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds
like a cross between a gangster and a king.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
I think you're gonna find   when all
this shit is over and done   I think
you're gonna find yourself one smilin'
motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right
now you got ability. But painful as
it may be, ability don't last. Now
that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of
life, but it's a fact of life your
ass is gonna hafta git realistic
about. This business is filled to
the brim with unrealistic
motherfuckers who thought their ass
aged like wine.  Besides, even if
you went all the way, what would you
be? Feather-weight champion of the
world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you
can even get a credit card based on
that.

A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front
of Butch. Butch picks it up.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Now the night of the fight, you may
fell a slight sting, that's pride
fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride
only hurts, it never helps. Fight
through that shit. 'Cause a year
from now, when you're kickin' it in
the Caribbean you're gonna say,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

BUTCH
I got no problem with that.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
In the fifth, your ass goes down.

Butch nods his head: "yes."

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Say it!

BUTCH
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

CUT TO:

INT. CAR (MOVING)   DAY

Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964
cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio,
ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.

EXT. SALLY LEROY'S   DAY

Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus
owns.

Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking
lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked,
revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE.
Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin
Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally
LeRoy's.

ENGLISH DAVE
Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam,
git your ass on in here.

Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between
Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door
in our faces.

INT. SALLY LEROY'S   DAY

The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave
crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

VINCENT
Where's the big man?

ENGLISH DAVE
He's over there, finishing up some
business.

VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with
his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of
yet still UNSEEN Marsellus.

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
Hang back for a second or two, and
when you see the white boy leave, go
on over.  In the meanwhile, can I
make you an espresso?

VINCENT
How 'bout a cup of just plain lo'
American?

ENGLISH DAVE
Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia
out tomorrow?

VINCENT
At Marsellus' request.

ENGLISH DAVE
Have you met Mia?

VINCENT
Not yet.

English Dave smiles to himself.

VINCENT
What's so funny?

ENGLISH DAVE
Not a goddamn thing.

VINCENT
Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big
man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit
across a table, chew my food with my
mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and
that's all I'm gonna do.

English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

ENGLISH DAVE
My name's Paul, and this is between
y'all.

Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his
cup of "Plain ol' American."

BUTCH
(to English Dave)
Can I get a pack'a Red Apples?

ENGLISH DAVE
Filters?

BUTCH
Non.

While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his
coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.

BUTCH
Lookin' at somethin', friend?

VINCENT
I ain't your friend, palooka.

Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.

BUTCH
What was that?

VINCENT
I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Vincent Vega has entered the building,
git your ass over here!

Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another
glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME,
looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching
business.

BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure
that is Marsellus.

Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend
of Marsellus, he better let it go   for now.

ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)
Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.

Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays
English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN)   NIGHT

CLOSEUP   JODY

A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of
her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in
her lips, eyebrows and nose.

JODY
...I'll lend it to you. It's a great
book on body piercing.

Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen
table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is
at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

TRUDI
You know how they use that gun when
they pierce your ears? They don't
use that when they pierce your
nipples, do they?

JODY
Forget that gun. That gun goes against
the entire idea behind piercing. All
of my piercing, sixteen places on my
body, every one of 'em done with a
needle. Five in each ear. One through
the nipple on my left breast. One
through my right nostril.  One through
my left eyebrow. One through my lip.
One in my clit. And I wear a stud in
my tongue.

Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear
and out the other, until that last remark.

VINCENT
(interrupting)
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I'm
curious, why would you get a stud in
your tongue?

Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious
thing in the world.

JODY
It's a sex thing. It helps fellatio.

That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it
makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent
to ponder the truth of her statement.

LANCE (O.S.)
Vince, you can come in now!

INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM   NIGHT

Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly
appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly
personality. LANCE has been selling drugs his entire adult
life. He's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and
has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a
"Speed Racer" tee-shirt.

Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.

Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.

LANCE
Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very
good stuff. This is Bava, different,
but equally good. And this is Choco
from the Hartz Mountains of Germany.
Now the first two are the same, forty-
five an ounce   those are friend
prices   but this one...
(pointing to the Choco)
...this one's a little more expensive.
It's fifty-five. But when you shoot
it, you'll know where that extra
money went.  Nothing wrong with the
first two. It's real, real, real,
good shit. But this one's a fuckin'
madman.

VINCENT
Remember, I just got back from
Amsterdam.

LANCE
Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood?
No.  You're in my house. White people
who know the difference between good
shit and bad shit, this is the house
they come to. My shit, I'll take the
Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit
any ol' day of the fuckin' week.

VINCENT
That's a bold statement.

LANCE
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is
a seller's market. Coke is fuckin'
dead as disco. Heroin's comin' back
in a big fuckin' way. It's this whole
seventies retro. Bell bottoms, heroin,
they're as hot as hell.

Vincent takes out a roll of money that would choke a horse
to death.

VINCENT
Give me three hundred worth of the
madman.  If it's as good as you say,
I'll be back for a thousand.

LANCE
I just hope I still have it. Whaddya
think of Trudi? She ain't got a
boyfriend, wanna hand out an' get
high?

VINCENT
Which one's Trudi? The one with all
the shit in her face?

LANCE
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.

Vincent and Lance giggle at the "faux pas."

VINCENT
I'm on my way somewhere. I got a
dinner engagement. Rain check?

LANCE
No problem?

Vincent takes out his case of the works (utensils for shooting
up).

VINCENT
You don't mind if I shoot up here?

LANCE
Me casa, su casa.

VINCENT
Mucho gracias.

Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two
continue to talk, Vince shoots up.

LANCE
Still got your Malibu?

VINCENT
You know what some fucker did to it
the other day?

LANCE
What?

VINCENT
Fuckin' keyed it.

LANCE
Oh man, that's fucked up.

VINCENT
Tell me about it. I had the goddamn
thing in storage three years. It's
out five fuckin' days   five days,
and some dickless piece of shit fucks
with it.

LANCE
They should be fuckin' killed. No
trial, no jury, straight to execution.

As he cooks his heroin...

VINCENT
I just wish I caught 'em doin' it,
ya know?  Oh man, I'd give anything
to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been
worth his doin' it, if I coulda just
caught 'em, you know what I mean?

LANCE
It's chicken shit. You don't fuck
another man's vehicle.

CLOSEUP   THE NEEDLE

Going into Vincent's vein.

CLOSEUP   BLOOD

Spurting back into the syringe, mixing with the heroin.

CLOSEUP   VINCENT'S THUMB

Pushing down on the plunger.

CUT TO:

EXT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE   NIGHT

Vincent walks toward the house and pulls a note off the door

CLOSEUP   NOTE

The Note reads:

"Hi Vincent, I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside
and make yourself a drink.  Mia"

MIA (V.O.)
Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed.
The door's open. Come inside and
make yourself a drink.

FADE TO WHITE

Music in.

FADE TO:

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE   LIVING ROOM   NIGHT

Vincent enters on the background.

VINCENT
Hello?

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE   DRESSING ROOM   NIGHT

MIA, Marcellus' beautiful young wife. Video screens are in
the background. Dusty Springfield is singing "SON OF A
PREACHER MAN".

Mia's mouth comes toward a microphone.

MIA
(into microphone)

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE   LIVING ROOM   NIGHT

Vincent turns.

MIA

fellas.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE   LIVING ROOM   NIGHT

Vincent finds the intercom on the wall.

Push the button if you want to talk.

VINCENT

VINCENT
(into intercom)
Okay.
(licks lips)

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE   DRESSING ROOM   NIGHT

A video screen with an image of Vincent, walking. The Dusty
Springfield song continues.

Mia turns a knob which controls the movement of the video
camera in Marcellus' living room.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE   LIVING ROOM   NIGHT

Vincent picks up a bottle of scotch. He sniffs the bottle,
and then pours it into a glass.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE   DRESSING ROOM   NIGHT

A razor blade cuts cocaine on a mirror.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE   LIVING ROOM   NIGHT

Vincent drinks a glass of scotch.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE   DRESSING ROOM   NIGHT

Mia sniffs the cocaine.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE   LIVING ROOM   NIGHT

Vincent sips the drink and looks at a portrait of Mia on the
wall.

Mia walks into the room, and takes the needle off a record.
The Dusty Springfield song stops.

MIA
Let's go.

EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S   NIGHT

In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over
L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're
all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book,
Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer,
saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the
Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and
over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's
diners.

Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of
view.

Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with
a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a
red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath
the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that
is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."

VINCENT
What the fuck is this place?

MIA
This is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis
man should love it.

VINCENT
Come on, Mia, let's go get a steak.

MIA
You can get a steak here, daddy-o.
Don't be a...

Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on
the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.

VINCENT
After you, kitty-cat.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S   NIGHT

Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint
English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over
the wall

("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF
THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that
the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s
cars.

In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign
on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." Some wannabe beboppers
(actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or
barefeet.

The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead,
B   W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The
WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons:
MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and
LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing
appropriate costumes.

Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red
'59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting
a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing
you please me."

BUDDY
Hi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?

VINCENT
I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

BUDDY
How d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp,
or bloody as hell?

VINCENT
Bloody as hell. And to drink, a
vanilla coke.

BUDDY
How 'bout you, Peggy Sue?

MIA
I'll have the Durwood Kirby burger  
bloody   and a five-dollar shake.

BUDDY
How d'ya want that shake, Martin and
Lewis, or Amos and Andy?

MIA
Martin and Lewis.

VINCENT
Did you just order a five-dollar
shake?

MIA
Sure did.

VINCENT
A shake? Milk and ice cream?

MIA
Uh-huh.

VINCENT
It costs five dollars?

BUDDY
Yep.

VINCENT
You don't put bourbon in it or
anything?

BUDDY
Nope.

VINCENT
Just checking.

Buddy exits.

Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are
dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers,
and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing,
The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her
customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a
fool.

MIA
Whaddya think?

VINCENT
It's like a wax museum with a pulse
rate.

Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling
himself a smoke.

After a second of watching him  

MIA
What are you doing?

VINCENT
Rollin' a smoke.

MIA
Here?

VINCENT
It's just tobacco.

MIA
Oh. Well in that case, will you roll
me one, cowboy?

As he finishes licking it  

VINCENT
You can have this one, cowgirl.

He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to
her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's
hand. He lights it.

MIA
Thanks.

VINCENT
Think nothing of it.

He begins rolling one for himself.

As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner,
making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a
square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS
the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out
a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

Back to Mia and Vincent.

MIA
Marsellus said you just got back
from Amsterdam.

VINCENT
Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.

MIA
That was my fifteen minutes.

VINCENT
What was it?

MIA
It was show about a team of female
secret agents called "Fox Force Five."

VINCENT
What?

MIA
"Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a
bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in
we're a force to be reckoned with.
Five, as in there's one... two ...
three... four... five of us. There
was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal
from that show "Baton Rouge," she
was the leader. A Japanese one, a
black one, a French one and a brunette
one, me.  We all had special skills.
Sommerset had a photographic memory,
the Japanese fox was a kung fu master,
the black girl was a demolition
expert, the French fox' specialty
was sex...

VINCENT
What was your specialty?

MIA
Knives. The character I played, Raven
McCoy, her background was she was
raised by circus performers. So she
grew up doing a knife act. According
to the show, she was the deadliest
woman in the world with a knife. But
because she grew up in a circus, she
was also something of an acrobat.
She could do illusions, she was a
trapeze artist   when you're keeping
the world safe from evil, you never
know when being a trapeze artist's
gonna come in handy. And she knew a
zillion old jokes her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her. If
we woulda got picked up, they woulda
worked in a gimmick where every
episode I woulda told and ol joke.

VINCENT
Do you remember any of the jokes?

MIA
Well I only got the chance to say
one, 'cause we only did one show.

VINCENT
Tell me.

MIA
No. It's really corny.

VINCENT
C'mon, don't be that way.

MIA
No. You won't like it and I'll be
embarrassed.

VINCENT
You told it in front of fifty million
people and you can't tell it to me?
I promise I won't laugh.

MIA
(laughing)
That's what I'm afraid of.

VINCENT
That's not what I meant and you know
it.

MIA
You're quite the silver tongue devil,
aren't you?

VINCENT
I meant I wouldn't laugh at you.

MIA
That's not what you said Vince. Well
now I'm definitely not gonna tell
ya, 'cause it's been built up too
much.

VINCENT
What a gyp.

Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around
the straw of her shake.

MIA
Yummy!

VINCENT
Can I have a sip of that? I'd like
to know what a five-dollar shake
tastes like.

MIA
Be my guest.

She slides the shake over to him.

MIA
You can use my straw, I don't have
kooties.

Vincent smiles.

VINCENT
Yeah, but maybe I do.

MIA
Kooties I can handle.

He takes a sip.

VINCENT
Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin'
good milk shake.

MIA
Told ya.

VINCENT
I don't know if it's worth five
dollars, but it's pretty fuckin'
good.

He slides the shake back.

Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.

MIA
Don't you hate that?

VINCENT
What?

MIA
Uncomfortable silences. Why do we
feel it's necessary to yak about
bullshit in order to be comfortable?

VINCENT
I don't know.

MIA
That's when you know you found
somebody special. When you can just
shit the fuck up for a minute, and
comfortably share silence.

VINCENT
I don't think we're there yet. But
don't feel bad, we just met each
other.

MIA
Well I'll tell you what, I'll go to
the bathroom and powder my nose,
while you sit here and think of
something to say.

VINCENT
I'll do that.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM)   NIGHT

Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the
bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.

MIA
(imitating Steppenwolf)
I said goddamn!

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA)   NIGHT

Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his
eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.

Mia comes back to the table.

MIA
Don't you love it when you go to the
bathroom and you come back to find
your food waiting for you?

VINCENT
We're lucky we got it at all. Buddy
Holly doesn't seem to be much of a
waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn
Monroe's section.

MIA
Which one, there's two Marilyn
Monroes.

VINCENT
No there's not.

Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.

VINCENT
That's Marilyn Monroe...

Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and
capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS  

VINCENT
... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I
don't see Jayne Mansfield, so it
must be her night off.

MIA
Pretty smart.

VINCENT
I have moments.

MIA
Did ya think of something to say?

VINCENT
Actually, there's something I've
wanted to ask you about, but you
seem like a nice person, and I didn't
want to offend you.

MIA
Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like
mindless, boring, getting-to-know-
you chit-chat. This sounds like you
actually have something to say.

VINCENT
Only if you promise not to get
offended.

MIA
You can't promise something like
that. I have no idea what you're
gonna ask. You could ask me what
you're gonna ask me, and my natural
response could be to be offended.
Then, through no fault of my own, I
woulda broken my promise.

VINCENT
Then let's just forget it.

MIA
That is an impossibility. Trying to
forget anything as intriguing as
this would be an exercise in futility.

VINCENT
Is that a fact?

Mia nods her head: "Yes."

MIA
Besides, it's more exciting when you
don't have permission.

VINCENT
What do you think about what happened
to Antwan?

MIA
Who's Antwan?

VINCENT
Tony Rocky Horror.

MIA
He fell out of a window.

VINCENT
That's one way to say it. Another
way is, he was thrown out. Another
was is, he was thrown out by
Marsellus. And even another way is,
he was thrown out of a window by
Marsellus because of you.

MIA
Is that a fact?

VINCENT
No it's not, it's just what I heard.

MIA
Who told you this?

VINCENT
They.

Mia and Vincent smile.

MIA
They talk a lot, don't they?

VINCENT
They certainly do.

MIA
Well don't by shy Vincent, what
exactly did they say?

Vincent is slow to answer.

MIA
Let me help you Bashful, did it
involve the F-word?

VINCENT
No. They just said Rocky Horror gave
you a foot massage.

MIA
And...?

VINCENT
No and, that's it.

MIA
You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror
out of a four-story window because
he massaged my feet?

VINCENT
Yeah.

MIA
And you believed that?

VINCENT
At the time I was told, it seemed
reasonable.

MIA
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a
four story window for giving me a
foot massage seemed reasonable?

VINCENT
No, it seemed excessive. But that
doesn't mean it didn't happen. I
heard Marsellus is very protective
of you.

MIA
A husband being protective of his
wife is one thing. A husband almost
killing another man for touching his
wife's feet is something else.

VINCENT
But did it happen?

MIA
The only thing Antwan ever touched
of mine was my hand, when he shook
it. I met Anwan once   at my wedding
  then never again.  The truth is,
nobody knows why Marsellus tossed
Tony Rocky Horror out of that window
except Marsellus and Tony Rocky
Horror. But when you scamps get
together, you're worse than a sewing
circle.

CUT TO:

ED SULLIVAN AND MARILYN MONROE STAND ON STAGE

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment
you've all been waiting for, the
worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist
contest.

Patrons cheer.

Ed Sullivan is with Marilyn Monroe, who holds a trophy.

ED SULLIVAN
...One lucky couple will win this
handsome trophy that Marilyn here is
holding.

Marilyn holds the trophy.

ED SULLIVAN
...Now, who will be our first
contestants?

Mia holds her hand.

MIA
Right here.

Vincent reacts.

MIA
I wanna dance.

VINCENT
No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.

MIA
(overlapping)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do
believe Marsellus, my husband, your
boss, told you to take me out and do
whatever I wanted, Now, I want to
dance. I want to win. I want that
trophy.

VINCENT
(sighs)
All right.

MIA
So, dance good.

VINCENT
All right, you asked for it.

Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
Let's hear it for our first
contestants.

Patrons cheer.

Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.

ED SULLIVAN
Now let's meet our first contestants
here this evening. Young lady, what
is your name?

MIA
(into microphone)
Missus Mia Wallace.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
And, uh, how 'bout your fella here?

MIA
(into microphone)
Vincent Vega.

ED SULLIVAN
(into microphone)
All right, let's see what you can
do. Take it away!

Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL".
They make hand movements as they dance.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME   NIGHT

The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the
previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.

Then...

The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

VINCENT
Was than an uncomfortable silence?

MIA
I don't know what that was.
(pause)
Music and drinks!

Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his
overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

VINCENT
I'm gonna take a piss.

MIA
That was a little bit more information
than I needed to know, but go right
ahead.

Vincent shuffles off to the john.

Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs
and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high
energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She
dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's
overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It
feels good.

Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch.
Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco
on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks
the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a
little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so
anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out
his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg,
trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you
know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly
brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up,
then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she
takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in
the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something
else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder
inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance.
Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her
face.

MIA
(like you would say
Bingo!)
Disco! Vince, you little cola nut,
you've been holding out on me.

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE)   NIGHT

Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to
himself in the mirror.

VINCENT
One drink and leave. Don't be rude,
but drink your drink quickly, say
goodbye, walk out the door, get in
your car, and go down the road.

LIVING ROOM

Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines
on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred
dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the
fat line.

CLOSEUP   MIA

Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels
like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong.
Then... the rush hits...

BATHROOM

Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his
dialogue with the mirror.

VINCENT
...It's a moral test of yourself,
whether or not you can maintain
loyalty. Because when people are
loyal to each other, that's very
meaningful.

LIVING ROOM

Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but
it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from
her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her
stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

BATHROOM

Vince continues.

VINCENT
So you're gonna go out there, drink
your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had
a very lovely evening," go home, and
jack off.  And that's all you're
gonna do.

Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's
ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of
that door. So he goes through it.

LIVING ROOM

We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to
the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like
a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are
down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the
tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her
face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open.
Slack-jawed.

VINCENT
Jesus Christ!

Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body.
Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck
to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.

Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

VINCENT
(sounding weird)
Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles,
but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.

Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

VINCENT
(to himself)
I'll be a son-of-a-bitch.
(to Mia)
Mia! MIA! What did you take? Answer
me honey, what did you take?

Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.

Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the
rack.

He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent
makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

VINCENT
(yelling to Mia)
Okay honey, we're getting you on
your feet.

He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

VINCENT
We're on our feet now, and now we're
gonna talk out to the car. Here we
go, watch us walk.

We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING)   NIGHT

INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.

Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws,
speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.

INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING)   NIGHT

Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting
like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when
he glances over at Mia.

Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag
of water.

Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches
a number.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE   NIGHT

At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant
drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.

He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-
out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT,
CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand
is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of
him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n
Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in
an ashtray.

On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three
Stooges, and they're getting married.

PREACHER (EMIL SIMKUS)
(on TV)
Hold hands, you love birds.

The phone RINGS.

Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.

It RINGS again.

Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.

JODY (O.S.)
Lance! The phone's ringing!

LANCE
(calling back)
I can hear it!

JODY (O.S.)
I thought you told those fuckin'
assholes never to call this late!

LANCE
(by the phone)
I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna
tell this fuckin' asshole right now!
(he answers the phone)
Hello, do you know how late it is?
You're not supposed to be callin' me
this fuckin' late.

BACK TO:

VINCENT IN THE MALIBU

Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching
the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the
conversation.

VINCENT
Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big
fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way
to your place.

LANCE
Whoa, hold you horses man, what's
the problem?

VINCENT
You still got an adrenaline shot?

LANCE
(dawning on him)
Maybe.

VINCENT
I need it man, I got a chick she's
fuckin'  Doing on me.

LANCE
Don't bring her here!  I'm not even
fuckin' joking with you, don't you
be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt
to my house!

VINCENT
No choice.

LANCE
She's ODin'?

VINCENT
Yeah. She's dyin'.

LANCE
Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take
'er to a hospital and call a lawyer!

VINCENT
Negative.

LANCE
She ain't my fuckin' problem, you
fucked her up, you deal with it  
are you talkin' to me on a cellular
phone?

VINCENT
Sorry.

LANCE
I don't know you, who is this, don't
come here, I'm hangin' up.

VINCENT
Too late, I'm already here.

At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu
coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his
curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH
in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn
and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out
of SHATTERS from the impact.

JODY (O.S.)
What the hell was that?

Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front
lawn.

EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE   NIGHT

Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia
out.

LANCE
Have you lost your mind?! You crashed
your car in my fuckin' house! You
talk about drug shit on a cellular
fuckin' phone  

VINCENT
If you're through havin' your little
hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get
your needle and git it now!

LANCE
Are you deaf? You're not bringin'
that fucked up bitch in my house!

VINCENT
This fucked up bitch is Marsellus
Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin'
croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But
before he turns me into a bar soap,
I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about
how you coulda saved her life, but
instead you let her die on your front
lawn.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE   NIGHT

WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.

Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's
wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone
on it.

We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking
through the hall into the living room.

JODY
It's only one-thirty in the goddamn
mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on
out here?

As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance
standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of
the room.

From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a
DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference
here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

JODY
Who's she?

Lance looks up at Jody.

LANCE
Get that black box in the bedroom I
have with the adrenaline shot.

JODY
What's wrong with her?

VINCENT
She's ODing on us.

JODY
Well get her the hell outta here!

LANCE AND VINCENT
(in stereo)
Get the fuckin' shot!

JODY
Don't yell and me!

She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking
for the shot.

WE MOVE into the room with the two men.

VINCENT
(to Lance)
You two are a match made in heaven.

LANCE
Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay?
While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta
get a medical book.

VINCENT
What do you need a medical book for?

LANCE
To tell me how to do it. I've never
given an adrenaline shot before.

VINCENT
You've had that thing for six years
and you never used it?

LANCE
I never had to use it. I don't go
joypoppin' with bubble-gummers, all
of my friends can handle their highs!

VINCENT
Well then get it.

LANCE
I am, if you'll let me.

VINCENT
I'm not fuckin' stoppin' you.

LANCE
Stop talkin' to me, and start talkin'
to her.

WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...

INT. SPARE ROOM

With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning
the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words,
"Come on," endlessly.

From OFF SCREEN we hear:

VINCENT (O.S.)
Hurry up man! We're losin' her!

LANCE
(calling back)
I'm looking as fast as I can!

Lance continues his frenzied search.

WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.

JODY (O.S.)
What's he lookin' for?

VINCENT (O.S.)
I dunno, some medical book.

Jody calls to LANCE.

JODY (O.S.)
What are you lookin' for?

LANCE
My black medical book!

As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit,
Jody appears in the doorway.

JODY
Whata're you looking for?

LANCE
My black fuckin' medical book. It's
like a text book they give to nurses.

JODY
I never saw a medical book.

LANCE
Trust me, I have one.

JODY
Well if it's that important, why
didn't you keep it with the shot?

Lance spins toward her.

LANCE
I don't know! Stop bothering me!

JODY
While you're lookin' for it, that
girl's gonna die on our carpet. You're
never gonna find it in all this shit.
For six months now, I've been telling
you to clean this room  

VINCENT (O.S.)
  get your ass in here, fuck the
book!

Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT
heading for the living room.

LIVING ROOM

Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance
reenters the room.

VINCENT
Quit fuckin' around man and give her
the shot!

Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He
opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.

LANCE
While I'm doing this, take her shirt
off and find her heart.

Vince rips her blouse open.

Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.

VINCENT
Does it have to be exact?

LANCE
Yeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving
her an injection in the heart, so I
gotta exactly hit her in the heart.

VINCENT
Well, I don't know exactly where her
heart is, I think it's here.

Vince points to Mia's right breast.  Lance glances over and
nods.

LANCE
That's it.

As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.

VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, got
one?

JODY
What?

VINCENT
I need a big fat magic marker, any
felt pen'll do, but a magic marker
would be great.

JODY
Hold on.

Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her
enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents
of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.

The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.

LANCE
It's ready, I'll tell you what to
do.

VINCENT
You're gonna give her the shot.

LANCE
No, you're gonna give her the shot.

VINCENT
I've never does this before.

LANCE
I've never done this before either,
and I ain't starting now. You brought
'er here, that means you give her
the shot. The day I bring an ODing
bitch to your place, then I gotta
give her the shot.

Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic
marker in her hand.

JODY
Got it.

Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes
a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

VINCENT
Okay, what do I do?

LANCE
Well, you're giving her an injection
of adrenaline straight to her heart.
But she's got a breast plate in front
of her heart, so you gotta pierce
through that. So what you gotta do
is bring the needle down in a stabbing
motion.

Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The
Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN".

VINCENT
I gotta stab her?

LANCE
If you want the needle to pierce
through to her heart, you gotta stab
her hard.

Then once you do, push down on the plunger.

VINCENT
What happens after that?

LANCE
I'm curious about that myself.

VINCENT
This ain't a fuckin' joke man!

LANCE
She's supposed to come out of it
like  
(snaps his fingers)
  that.

Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing
motion.

He looks down on Mia.

Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.

Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.

VINCENT
Count to three.

Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know
what to expect.

LANCE
One...

RED DOT on Mia's body.

Needle raised ready to strike.

LANCE (O.S.)
...two...

Jody's face is alive with anticipation.

NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.

LANCE (O.S.)
...three!

The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.

Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the
chest.

Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.

The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline
out through the needle.

Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of
the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck
in her chest   SCREAMING.

Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in
front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.

Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of
air.

The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken
to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

LANCE
If you're okay, say something.

Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a
relatively normal voice.

MIA
Something.

Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and
shaking from how close to death Mia came.

JODY
Anybody want a beer?

CUT TO:

INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING)   NIGHT

Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says
anything, both are still too shaken.

EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE   NIGHT

The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying
a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway
toward her front door.

VINCENT (O.S.)
Mia!

She turns around.

Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big
distance between the two.

VINCENT
What are your thoughts on how to
handle this?

MIA
What's yours?

VINCENT
Well I'm of the opinion that Marsellus
can live his whole live and never
ever hear of this incident.

Mia smiles.

MIA
Don't worry about it. If Marsellus
ever heard of this, I'd be in as
much trouble as you.

VINCENT
I seriously doubt that.

MIA
If you can keep a secret, so can I.

VINCENT
Let's shake on it.

The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to
shake and shake they do.

VINCENT
Mum's the word.

Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-
evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.

Vincent smiles.

VINCENT
If you'll excuse me, I gotta go home
and have a heart attack.

Mia giggles.

Vincent turns to leave.

MIA
You still wanna hear my "FOX FORCE
FIVE" joke?

Vincent turns around.

VINCENT
Sure, but I think I'm still a little
too petrified to laugh.

MIA
Uh-huh. You won't laugh because it's
not funny. But if you still wanna
hear it, I'll tell it.

VINCENT
I can't wait.

MIA
Three tomatoes are walking down the
street, a poppa tomato, a momma
tomato, and a little baby tomato.
The baby tomato is lagging behind
the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa
tomato gets mad, goes over to the
momma tomato and stamps on him  
(stamps on the ground)
  and says: catch up.

They both smile, but neither laugh.

MIA
See ya 'round, Vince.

Mia turns and walks inside her house.

CLOSEUP   VINCENT

After Mia walks inside. Vincent continues to look at where
she was. He brings his hands to his lips and blows her a
kiss. Then exits FRAME leaving it empty. WE HEAR his Malibu
START UP and DRIVE AWAY.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP On the cartoon "SPEED RACER."  Speed is giving a
detailed description of all the features on his race car
"The Mac-5," which he does at the beginning of every episode.

OFF SCREEN we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE... .

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Butch.

DISSOLVE TO:

BUTCH'S POV

We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in
Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish,
stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to
her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force
officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old
boy.

MOTHER
Butch, stop watching TV a second. We
got a special visitor. Now do you
remember when I told you your daddy
dies in a P.O.W. camp?

BUTCH (O.S.)
Uh-huh.

MOTHER
Well this here is Capt. Koons. He
was in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.

CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and
bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's
eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas
accent.

CAPT. KOONS
Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard
a bunch about you. See, I was a good
friend of your Daddy's. We were in
that Hanoi pit of hell over five
years together.  Hopefully, you'll
never have to experience this
yourself, but when two men are in a
situation like me and your Daddy
were, for as long as we were, you
take on certain responsibilities of
the other. If it had been me who had
not made it, Major Coolidge would be
talkin' right now to my son Jim. But
the way it worked out is I'm talkin'
to you, Butch. I got somethin' for
ya.

The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.

CAPT. KOONS
This watch I got here was first
purchased by your great-granddaddy.
It was bought during the First World
War in a little general store in
Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought
by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge
the day he set sail for Paris. It
was your great-granddaddy's war watch,
made by the first company to ever
make wrist watches. You see, up until
then, people just carried pocket
watches. Your great-granddaddy wore
that watch every day he was in the
war. Then when he had done his duty,
he went home to your great-
grandmother, took the watch off his
wrist and put it in an ol' coffee
can. And in that can it stayed 'til
your grandfather Dane Coolidge was
called upon by his country to go
overseas and fight the Germans once
again. This time they called it World
War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave
it to your granddad for good luck.
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as
good as his old man's. Your granddad
was a Marine and he was killed with
all the other Marines at the battle
of Wake Island. Your granddad was
facing death and he knew it. None of
those boys had any illusions about
ever leavin' that island alive. So
three days before the Japanese took
the island, your 22-year old
grandfather asked a gunner on an Air
Force transport named Winocki, a man
he had never met before in his life,
to deliver to his infant son, who he
had never seen in the flesh, his
gold watch. Three days later, your
grandfather was dead. But Winocki
kept his word. After the war was
over, he paid a visit to your
grandmother, delivering to your infant
father, his Dad's gold watch. This
watch. This watch was on your Daddy's
wrist when he was shot down over
Hanoi. He was captured and put in a
Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew
if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd
be confiscated. The way your Daddy
looked at it, that watch was your
birthright. And he'd be damned if
and slopeheads were gonna put their
greasy yella hands on his boy's
birthright. So he hid it in the one
place he knew he could hide somethin'.
His ass. Five long years, he wore
this watch up his ass. Then when he
died of dysentery, he gave me the
watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass for two years.
Then, after seven years, I was sent
home to my family. And now, little
man, I give the watch to you.

Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes
into FRAME to accept it.

CUT TO:

INT. LOCKER ROOM   NIGHT

The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia:
trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few
zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to
him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory,
he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a
little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to
be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

KLONDIKE
It's time, Butch.

BUTCH
I'm ready.

Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB
outside.

He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch
hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him
on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH
COOLIDGE".

The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for
Butch.

As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit.
Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet,
empty locker room.

We hear over the black and white title:

SPORTSCASTER  1 (O.S.)
  Well Dan, that had to be the
bloodiest and, hands-down, the most
brutal fight this city has ever seen.

The SOUND of chaos in the b.g.

FADE IN:

EXT. ALLEY (RAINING)   NIGHT

A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The
sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked
car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from
inside.

SPORTSCASTER  1 (O.S.)
...Coolidge was out of there faster
than I've ever seen a victorious
boxer vacate the ring. Do you think
he knew Willis was dead?

SPORTSCASTER  2 (O.S.)
My guess would be yes, Richard. I
could see from my position here, the
frenzy in his eyes give way to the
realization of what he was doing. I
think any man would've left the ring
that fast.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TAXI (PARKED RAINING)   NIGHT

Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named
ESMARELDA VILLALOBOS. A young woman, with Spanish looks,
sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a
white styrofoam cup.

The Sportscasters continue their coverage.

SPORTSCASTER  1 (O.S.)
Do you feel this ring death tragedy
will have an effect on the world of
boxing?

SPORTSCASTER  2 (O.S.)
Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't
help but shake the world of boxing
to its very foundation. But it's of
paramount importance that during the
sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the
W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the  

CLICK   Esmarelda shuts off the radio.

She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in
the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING)   NIGHT

A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-
side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage
dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed
in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to
the dumpster below.

ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS
to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and
throws it to the ground.

INT. TAXI (PARKED   RAINING)   NIGHT

Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves,
HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through
the rearview mirror:

ESMARELDA
(Spanish accent)
Are you the man I was supposed to
pick up?

BUTCH
If you're the cab I called, I'm the
guy you're supposed to pick up.

ESMARELDA
Where to?

BUTCH
Outta here.

The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.

The meter is FLIPPED on.

Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING)   NIGHT

The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet
pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.

INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM)   NIGHT

Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through
the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall,
shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave
takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by
the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.

VINCENT
Mia. How you doin'?

MIA
Great. I never thanked you for the
dinner.

In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table  
dead.

His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is
on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.

The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table,
hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support.
We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
What'cha got?

ENGLISH DAVE
He booked.

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
I'm prepared to scour the earth for
this motherfucker. If Butch goes to
Indo China, I want a nigger hidin'
in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a
cap in his ass.

ENGLISH DAVE
I'll take care of it.

INT. CAB (MOVING   RAINING)   NIGHT

Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.

Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.

He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't
find the roll bar.

BUTCH
Hey, how do I open the window back
here?

ESMARELDA
I have to do it.

She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch
tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying
the other one.

Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.

ESMARELDA
Hey, mister?

BUTCH
(still working on the
glove)
What?

ESMARELDA
You were in that fight? The fight on
the radio   you're the fighter?

As he tosses his other glove out the window.

BUTCH
Whatever gave you that idea?

ESMARELDA
No c'mon, you're him, I know you're
him, tell me you're him.

BUTCH
(drying himself with
a gym towel)
I'm him.

ESMARELDA
You killed the other boxing man.

BUTCH
He's dead?

ESMARELDA
The radio said he was dead.

He finished wiping himself down.

BUTCH
(to himself)
Sorry 'bout that, Floyd.

He tosses the towel out the window.

Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.

ESMARELDA
What does it feel like?

BUTCH
(finds his shirt)
What does what feel like?

ESMARELDA
Killing a man. Beating another man
to death with your bare hands.

Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.

BUTCH
Are you some kinda weirdo?

ESMARELDA
No, it's a subject I have much
interest in. You are the first person
I ever met who has killed somebody.
So, what was it like to kill a man?

BUTCH
Tell ya what, you give me one of
them cigarettes, I'll give you an
answer.

Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.

ESMARELDA
Deal!

Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road,
passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not
looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in
it.

Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

He takes a long drag.

BUTCH
So...

He looks at her license.

BUTCH
...Esmarelda Villalobos   is that
Mexican?

ESMARELDA
The name is Spanish, but I'm
Columbian.

BUTCH
It's a very pretty name.

ESMARELDA
It mean "Esmarelda of the wolves."

BUTCH
That's one hell of a name you got
there, sister.

ESMARELDA
Thank you. And what is your name?

BUTCH
Butch.

ESMARELDA
Butch. What does it mean?

BUTCH
I'm an American, our names don't
mean shit. Anyway, moving right along,
what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?

ESMARELDA
I want to know what it feels like to
kill a man  

BUTCH
  I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know
he was dead 'til you told me he was
dead. Now I know he's dead, do you
wanna know how I feel about it?

Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."

BUTCH
I don't feel the least little bit
bad.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING)   NIGHT

We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.

BUTCH
(into phone)
What'd I tell ya, soon as the word
got out a fix was in, the odds would
be outta control. Hey, if he was a
better fighter he's be alive. If he
never laced up his gloves in the
first place, which he never shoulda
done, he'd be alive. Enough about
the poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's
talk about the rich and prosperous
Mr. Butch.  How many bookies you
spread it around with?

(PAUSE)
Eight? How long to collect?
(pause)
So by tomorrow evening, you'll have
it all?
(pause)
Good news Scotty, real good news   I
understand a few stragglers aside.
Me an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in
the morning. It should take us a
couple days to get into Knoxville.
Next time we see each other, it'll
be on Tennessee time.

Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to
take him wherever he wants to go.

BUTCH
(to himself in French
with English subtitles)
Fabienne my love, our adventure
begins.

CUT TO:

EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED   RAINING)   NIGHT

Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain
has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out,
now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic
jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.

ESMARELDA
Forty-five sixty.

Handing her the money.

BUTCH
Merci beaucoup. And here's a little
something for the effort.

Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds
it out of reach.

BUTCH
Now if anybody should ask you about
who your fare was tonight, what're
you gonna tell 'em?

ESMARELDA
The truth. Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted, Mexicans.

He gives her the bill.

BUTCH
Bon soir, Esmarelda.

ESMARELDA
(in Spanish)
Sleep well, Butch.

He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away.
She drives off.

INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX)   NIGHT

Butch enters and turns on the light.

Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to
us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.

FABIENNE
Keep the light off.

Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.

BUTCH
Is that better, sugar pop?

FABIENNE
Oui. Hard day at the office?

BUTCH
Pretty hard. I got into a fight.

FABIENNE
Poor baby. Can we make spoons?

Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.

When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in
babytalk.

FABIENNE
I was looking at myself in the mirror.

BUTCH
Uh-huh?

FABIENNE
I wish I had a pot.

BUTCH
You were lookin' in the mirror and
you wish you had some pot?

FABIENNE
A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are
sexy.

BUTCH
Well you should be happy, 'cause you
do.

FABIENNE
Shut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot!
I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna
when she did "Lucky Star," it's not
the same thing.

BUTCH
I didn't realize there was a
difference between a tummy and a pot
belly.

FABIENNE
The difference is huge.

BUTCH
You want me to have a pot?

FABIENNE
No. Pot bellies make a man look either
oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a
woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The
rest of you is normal. Normal face,
normal legs, normal hips, normal
ass, but with a big, perfectly round
pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a
tee-shirt two sizes too small to
accentuate it.

BUTCH
You think guys would find that
attractive?

FABIENNE
I don't give a damn what men find
attractive. It's unfortunate what we
find pleasing to the touch and
pleasing to the eye is seldom the
same.

BUTCH
If you a pot belly, I'd punch you in
it.

FABIENNE
You'd punch me in my belly?

BUTCH
Right in the belly.

FABIENNE
I'd smother you. I'd drop it on your
right on your face 'til you couldn't
breathe.

BUTCH
You'd do that to me?

FABIENNE
Yes!

BUTCH
Did you get everything, sugar pop?

FABIENNE
Yes, I did.

BUTCH
Good job.

FABIENNE
Did everything go as planned?

BUTCH
You didn't listen to the radio?

FABIENNE
I never listen to your fights. Were
you the winner?

BUTCH
I won alright.

FABIENNE
Are you still retiring?

BUTCH
Sure am.

FABIENNE
What about the man you fought?

BUTCH
Floyd retired too.

FABIENNE
(smiling)
Really?! He won't be fighting no
more?!

BUTCH
Not no more.

FABIENNE
So it all worked out in the finish?

BUTCH
We ain't at the finish, baby.

Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.

FABIENNE
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
If they find us, they'll kill us,
won't they?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
But they won't find us, will they?

Butch nods his head: "no."

FABIENNE
Do you still want me to go with you?

Butch nods his head: "yes."

FABIENNE
I don't want to be a burden or a
nuisance -

Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her
crotch.

Fabienne reacts.

FABIENNE
Say it!

BUTCH
Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

FABIENNE
Forever?

BUTCH
...and ever.

Fabienne lies her head back.

Butch continues to massage her crotch.

FABIENNE
Do you love me?

BUTCH
Oui.

FABIENNE
Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?

Butch kisses her on the mouth.

BUTCH
Will you kiss it?

She nods her head: "yes."

FABIENNE
But you first.

Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral
pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.

FABIENNE
(in French, with
English subtitles)
Butch my love, the adventure begins.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM

Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in
the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We
see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow
her up.

She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower
washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the
smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom.
Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his
head out.

BUTCH
I think I cracked a rib.

FABIENNE
Giving me oral pleasure?

BUTCH
No retard, from the fight.

FABIENNE
Don't call me retard.

BUTCH
(in a Mongoloid voice)
My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!

FABIENNE
Shut up fuck head! I hate that
Mongoloid voice.

BUTCH
Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it
back!  Can I have a towel please,
Miss Beautiful Tulip.

FABIENNE
Oh I like that, I like being called
a tulip. Tulip is much better than
Mongoloid.

She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban
on her head.

BUTCH
I didn't call you a Mongoloid, I
called you a retard, but I took it
back.

She hands him a towel.

BUTCH
Merci beaucoup.

FABIENNE
Butch?

BUTCH
(drying his head)
Yes, lemon pie.

FABIENNE
Where are we going to go?

BUTCH
I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want.
We're gonna get a lot of money from
this. But it ain't gonna be so much,
we can live like hogs in the fat
house forever. I was thinking we
could go somewhere in the South
Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll
carry us a long way down there.

FABIENNE
So if we wanted, we could live in
Bora Bora?

BUTCH
You betcha. And if after awhile you
don't dig Bora Bora, then we can
move over to Tahiti or Mexico.

FABIENNE
But I do not speak Spanish.

BUTCH
You don't speak Bora Boran either.
Besides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta
el zapataria?

FABIENNE
What does that mean?

BUTCH
Where's the shoe store?

FABIENNE
Donde esta el zapataria?

BUTCH
Excellent pronunciation. You'll be
my little mama ceta in no time.

Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes
her teeth.

Butch keeps on from the other room.

BUTCH (O.S.)
Que hora es?

FABIENNE
Que hora es?

BUTCH (O.S.)
What time is it?

FABIENNE
What time is it?

BUTCH (O.S.)
Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.

Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or
two, then she remember something.

FABIENNE
Butch.

She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only
to find him sound asleep in bed.

She looks at him for a moment.

FABIENNE
Forget it.

She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the
WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM   MORNING

SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still
asleep in bed.

Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the
bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still
wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.

ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking
on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".

Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing
him.

His start startles Fabienne.

FABIENNE
Merde! You startled me. Did you have
a bad dream?

Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to
focus.

Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV
Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

BUTCH
What are you watching?

FABIENNE
A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the
name.

BUTCH
Are you watchin' it?

Fabienne enters the room.

FABIENNE
In a way. Why? Would you like for me
to switch it off?

BUTCH
Would you please?

She reaches over and turns off the TV.

BUTCH
It's a little too early in the morning
for explosions and war.

FABIENNE
What was it about?

BUTCH
How should I know, you were the one
watchin' it.

Fabienne laughs.

FABIENNE
No, imbecile, what was your dream
about?

BUTCH
Oh, I... don't remember. It's really
rare I remember a dream.

FABIENNE
You just woke up from it.

BUTCH
Fabienne, I'm not lying to you, I
don't remember.

FABIENNE
Well, let's look at the grumpy man
in the morning. I didn't say you
were lying, it's just odd you don't
remember your dreams. I always
remember mine. Did you know you talk
in your sleep?

BUTCH
I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk
in my sleep?

FABIENNE
You did last night.

BUTCH
What did I say?

Laying on top of him.

FABIENNE
I don't know. I couldn't understand
you.

She kisses Butch.

FABIENNE
Why don't you get up and we'll get
some breakfast at that breakfast
place with the pancakes.

BUTCH
One more kiss and I'll get up.

Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.

FABIENNE
Satisfied?

BUTCH
Yep.

FABIENNE
Then get up, lazy bones.

Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of
the suitcase that Fabienne brought.

BUTCH
What time is it?

FABIENNE
Almost nine in the morning. What
time does our train arrive?

BUTCH
Eleven.

FABIENNE
I'm gonna order a big plate of
blueberry pancakes with maple syrup,
eggs over easy, and five sausages.

BUTCH
(surprised at her
potential appetite)
Anything to drink with that?

Butch is finished dressing.

FABIENNE
(referring to his
clothes)
Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a
tall glass or orange juice and a
black cup of coffee. After that, I'm
going to have a slice of pie.

As he goes through the suitcase.

BUTCH
Pie for breakfast?

FABIENNE
Any time of the day is a good time
for pie. Blueberry pie to go with
the pancakes. And on top, a thin
slice of melted cheese  

BUTCH
  where's my watch?

FABIENNE
It's there.

BUTCH
No, it's not. It's not here.

FABIENNE
Have you looked?

By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.

BUTCH
Yes I've fuckin' looked!!

He's now throwing clothes.

BUTCH
What the fuck do you think I'm doing?!
Are you sure you got it?

Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.

FABIENNE
Uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer
 

BUTCH
  on the little kangaroo.

FABIENNE
Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.

BUTCH
Well it's not here!

FABIENNE
(on the verge of tears)
Well it should be!

BUTCH
Oh it most definitely should be here,
but it's not. So where is it?

Fabienne is crying and scared.

Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more
menacing.

BUTCH
Fabienne, that was my father's fuckin'
watch. You know what my father went
through to git me that watch?... I
don't wanna get into it right now...
but he went through a lot. Now all
this other shit, you coulda set on
fire, but I specifically reminded
you not to forget my father's watch.
Now think, did you get it?

FABIENNE
I believe so...

BUTCH
You believe so? You either did, or
you didn't, now which one is it?

FABIENNE
Then I did.

BUTCH
Are you sure?

FABIENNE
(shaking)
No.

Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the
motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.

Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

BUTCH
(to Fabienne)
No! It's not your fault.
(he approached her)
You left it at the apartment.

He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

He touches her hand, she flinches.

BUTCH
If you did leave it at the apartment,
it's not your fault. I had you bring
a bunch of stuff. I reminded you
about it, but I didn't illustrate
how personal the watch was to me. If
all I gave a fuck about was my watch,
I should've told you. You ain't a
mind reader.

He kisses her hand. Then rises.

Fabienne is still sniffling.

Butch goes to the closet.

FABIENNE
I'm sorry.

Butch puts on his high school jacket.

BUTCH
Don't be. It just means I won't be
able to eat breakfast with you.

FABIENNE
Why does it mean that?

BUTCH
Because I'm going back to my apartment
to get my watch.

FABIENNE
Won't the gangsters be looking for
you there?

BUTCH
That's what I'm gonna find out. If
they are, and I don't think I can
handle it, I'll split.

Rising from the floor.

FABIENNE
I was so dreadful. I saw your watch,
I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

BUTCH
Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing
you could ever do would make me
permanently angry at you.
(pause)
I love you, remember?
(he digs some money
out of his wallet)
Now here's some money, order those
pancakes and have a great breakfast.

FABIENNE
Don't go.

BUTCH
I'll be back before you can say,
blueberry pie.

FABIENNE
Blueberry pie.

BUTCH
Well maybe not that fast, but fast.
Okay?  Okay?

FABIENNE
Okay.

He kisses her once more and heads for the door.

BUTCH
Bye-bye, sugar pop.

FABIENNE
Bye.

BUTCH
I'm gonna take your Honda.

FABIENNE
Okay.

And with that, he's out the door.

Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

INT. HONDA (MOVING)   DAY

Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his
fists as he drives down the street.

BUTCH
Of all the fuckin' things she coulda
forgot, she forgets my father's watch.
I specifically reminded her not to
forget it. "Bedside table   on the
kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't
forget my father's watch."

EXT. CITY STREET   DAY

The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is
little engine will take it.

CUT TO:

A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the
arrow pointing at one hour.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER   DAY

Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a
couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before
he goes boppin' through the front door.

EXT. ALLEY   DAY

Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street,
then he discreetly glances out.

EXT. STREET   BUTCH'S APARTMENT   DAY

Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of
cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of
place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.
Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of
Butch's home.

Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He
crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a
combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign
sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a
graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.

EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD   DAY

Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment
building. Once again, everything appears normal   the laundry
room, the pool, his apartment door   nothing appears
disturbed.

Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12.
He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening
it.

INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT   DAY

His apartment hasn't been touched.

He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick
look around. Obviously, no one is there.

Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the
refrigerator.

He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he
goes to the bedroom.

His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment   neat, clean
and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a
few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue
of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of
Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On
the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He
opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting
down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and
puts them in the toaster.

Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun
with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

BUTCH
(softly)
Holy shit.

He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines
it.

Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to
the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not
knowing what to do.

The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the
bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book
"MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.

Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

Vincent freezes.

Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's
direction.

Neither man opens his mouth.

Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

That's all the situation needed.

Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets
SIMULTANEOUSLY   LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him
through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door
at the end of the bathroom.

By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent
is annihilated.

Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look
goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once
Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61
back on the kitchen counter.

Then he exits the apartment, quickly.

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD   DAY

Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the
courtyard...

...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...

...goes through the alley...

...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.

EXT. HONDA   DAY

Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide
smile of a survivor breaks across his face.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET   DAY

The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his
apartment building.

INT. HONDA   DAY

Butch looks out the window at his former home.

BUTCH
That's how you're gonna beat 'em,
Butch.  They keep underestimatin'
ya.

This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips
a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he
SINGS along with it.

He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on
the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we
see:

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut,
carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam
cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street
in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see
Marsellus clearly.

Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front
of him.

When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances
to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"

Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question.
He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts
and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold
Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending
it up on the sidewalk.

Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what
at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his
nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play.
A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

PEDESTRIAN
Jesus, are you okay?

Butch look at him, spaced-out.

BUTCH
I guess.

Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS
gather around the body.

GAWKER  1
(to the others)
He's dead! He's dead!

This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

GAWKER  2
If you need a witness in court, I'll
be glad to help. He was a drunken
maniac. He hit you and crashed into
that car.

MARSELLUS
(still incoherent)
Who?

GAWKER  2
(pointing at Butch)
Him.

Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge
down the street, looking a shambles.

MARSELLUS
Well, I'll be damned.

The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back
away.

Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward
him.

BUTCH
Sacre bleu.

Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt,
shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground,
screaming.

LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
Oh my God, I've been shot!

That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.

Marsellus RUNS after him.

The CROWD looks agape.

Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a
sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".

INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP   DAY

MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter
of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of
Butch RACES into his world.

MAYNARD
Can I help you wit' somethin'?

BUTCH
Shut up!

Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands
next to the door.

MAYNARD
Now you just wait one goddamn minute
 

Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in.
He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist
in Marsellus' face.

The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man
FALLS FLAT on his back.

Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in
the face.

Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold
of his middle finger.

BUTCH
So you like chasing people, huh?

He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch
then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS
back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to
shield the splatter.

BUTCH
Well guess what, big man, you caught
me  

MAYNARD (O.S.)
  hold it right there, godammit!

Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a
pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

BUTCH
Look mister, this ain't any of your
business  

MAYNARD
  I'm makin' it my business! Now
toss that gun!

Butch does.

MAYNARD
Now you on top, stand up and come to
the counter.

Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he
gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face
with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on
the counter and moves to the telephone.

Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily
watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on
the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.

MAYNARD
Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just
caught a coupl'a flies.

Marsellus passes out.

FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP:

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM   DAY

TWO SHOT   BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are
two S M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and
a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are
unconscious.

Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both
guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two
prisoners look up at their captors.

Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one
hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in
his belt.

MAYNARD
Nobody kills anybody in my place of
business except me or Zed.

A BUZZER buzzes.

MAYNARD
That's Zed.

Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs
that lead to red curtains and goes through them.

WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed
inside the store.

Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of
the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking
in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other,
all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both
share at what they've gotten themselves into.

Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even
more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible.
The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is
a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and
stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a
long time, then says:

ZED
(to Maynard)
You said you waited for me?

MAYNARD
I did.

ZED
Then how come they're all beat up?

MAYNARD
They did that to each other. They
was fightin' when they came in. This
one was gonna shoot that one.

ZED
(to Butch)
You were gonna shoot him?

Butch makes no reply.

ZED
Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front
of this place?

MAYNARD
Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?

ZED
No, it's Thursday.

MAYNARD
Then she'll be fine.

ZED
Bring out The Gimp.

MAYNARD
I think The Gimp's sleepin'.

ZED
Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em
up then, won't you?

Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

MAYNARD
(yelling in the hole)
Wake up!

Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a
leash.

He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises
THE GIMP.

The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black
leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs
here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather
mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth.
They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large
dog.

Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners,
then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed,
then backs away.

MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Down!

The Gimp gets on its knees.

Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.

MAYNARD
Who's first?

ZED
I ain't fer sure yet.

Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany,
miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his
finger going back and forth between the two.

Butch are Marsellus are terrified.

Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.

The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.

Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving
left to right, then it stops.

TWO SHOT   BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on
Marsellus.

Zed stands up.

ZED
Wanna do it here?

MAYNARD
Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old
room.

Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old
room.

Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the
misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop.
Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and
Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the
back room, is empty.

As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before
he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.

MAYNARD
(to The Gimp)
Up!

The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on
the ceiling.

MAYNARD
Keep an eye on this one.

The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into
Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because
suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.

Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath
the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history
of comedy.

From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:

MAYNARD (O.S.)
Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight
in 'em!

We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.

ZED (O.S.)
You wanna fight? You wanna fight?
Good, I like to fight!

Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic,
hurriedly struggles to get free.

The Gimp is laughing wildly.

The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.

The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:

MAYNARD (O.S.)
That's it... that's it boy, you're
goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like
that... that's good.
(grunting faster)
Stay still... stay still goddamn ya!
Zed goddammit, git over here and
hold 'em!

Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite
easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it
were never connected by a bolt.

The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.

THE GIMP
Huhng?

The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook.
He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles
and grunts.

Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S
PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making
him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash
attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then
silently makes his way through the red curtains.

INT. PAWNSHOP   DAY

Butch sneaks to the door.

On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected
to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he
stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their
way with Marsellus.

Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in
a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the
pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in
with.

He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards
it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks
about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large
Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots
what he's been looking for:

A Samurai sword.

It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the
wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign.
Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its
sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten
in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his
thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not
on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems
made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the
sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears
through the red curtains to take care of business.

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM   DAY

Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.

Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind
the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.

INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM   DAY

Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It
swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched
positions.

Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden
horse.

Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.

Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up
behind him with the sword.

Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus,
red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see
Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.

BUTCH
Hey hillbilly.

Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.

Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across
the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on
Zed.

Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.

Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword
behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing
the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go
from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic,
which lies within reach.

Butch's eyes follow Zed's.

BUTCH
You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.

Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.

Zed studies Butch.

Butch looks hard at Zed.

Then a VOICE says:

MARSELLUS (O.S.)
Step aside, Butch.

Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him,
holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.

KABOOM!!!!

Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.

Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the
used shotgun shell.

Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

BUTCH
You okay?

MARSELLUS
Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from
okay!

Long pause.

BUTCH
What now?

MARSELLUS
What now? Well let me tell you what
now.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-
hittin' niggers, who'll go to work
on homes here with a pair of pliers
and a blow torch.
(to Zed)
Hear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I
ain't through with you by a damn
sight. I'm gonna git Medieval on
your ass.

BUTCH
I meant what now, between me and
you?

MARSELLUS
Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell
ya what now between me an' you. There
is no me an' you. Not no more.

BUTCH
So we're cool?

MARSELLUS
Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I
ask   two things I ask: Don't tell
nobody about this. This shit's between
me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-
the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-
agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It
ain't nobody else's business. Two:
leave town. Tonight. Right now. And
when you're gone, stay gone.  You've
lost your Los Angeles privileges.
Deal?

BUTCH
Deal.

The two men shake hands, then hug one another.

MARSELLUS
Go on now, get your ass outta here.

Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.

Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.

MARSELLUS
(into the phone)
Hello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta
bit of a situation.

EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP   DAY

Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He
looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment,
Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has
the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys
with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES
to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit.
Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...

INT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM   DAY

Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says,
Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a
BOOM BOX.

EXT. CITY STREET   CHOPPER (MOVING)   DAY

Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "GRACE."
He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.

The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.

EXT. MOTEL ROOM   DAY

Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the
motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.

FABIENNE (O.S.)
Butch, I was so worried!

BUTCH
Honey, grab your radio and your purse
and let's go!

FABIENNE (O.S.)
But what about all our bags?

BUTCH
Fuck the bags. We'll miss our train
if we don't split now.

FABIENNE (O.S.)
Is everything well? Are we in danger?

BUTCH
We're cool. In fact, we're super-
cool. But we gots to go. I'll wait
for you outside.

Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the
motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she
sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.

FABIENNE
Where did you get this motorcycle?

BUTCH
(he kick-starts it)
It's a chopper, baby, hop on.

Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.

FABIENNE
What happened to my Honda?

BUTCH
Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.

FABIENNE
You're hurt?

BUTCH
I might've broke my nose, no biggie.
Hop on.

She doesn't move.

Butch looks at her.

BUTCH
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!

Fabienne starts to cry.

Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the
bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her
hand.

BUTCH
I'm sorry, baby-love.

FABIENNE
(crying)
You were gone so long, I started to
think dreadful thoughts.

BUTCH
I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.
Everything's fine. Hey, how was
breakfast?

FABIENNE
(waterworks drying a
little)
It was good  

BUTCH
  did you get the blueberry pancakes?

FABIENNE
No, they didn't have blueberry
pancakes, I had to get buttermilk  
are you sure you're okay?

BUTCH
Baby-love, from the moment I left
you, this has been without a doubt
the single weirdest day of my entire
life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about
it.

Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.

FABIENNE
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

BUTCH
It's a chopper.

FABIENNE
Whose chopper is this?

BUTCH
Zed's.

FABIENNE
Who's Zed?

BUTCH
Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead.

And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the
SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.

FADE TO BLACK

TITLE CARD:

"JULES VINCENT JIMMIE   THE WOLF"

TITLE DISAPPEARS.

Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking.

JULES (O.S.)
You ever read the Bible, Brett?

BRETT (O.S.)
Yes!

JULES (O.S.)
There's a passage I got memorized,
seems appropriate for this situation:
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men..."

FADE UP:

INT. BATHROOM   DAY

We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in
earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except
this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The
Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard
to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly
CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.

JULES (O.S.)
"...blessed is he who, in the name
of charity and good will, shepherded
the weak through the valley of
darkness. And I will strike down
upon thee with great vengeance and
furious anger those who attempt to
poison and destroy my brothers. And
you will know I am the Lord when I
lay my vengeance upon you."

BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the
back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow
fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough
to stick their head through that door.

Then he listens to them talk.

VINCENT (O.S.)
Friend of yours?

JULES (O.S.)
Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.

Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the
door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around
is the way to go.

INT. APARTMENT   DAY

The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES
out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his
hand cannon.

FOURTH MAN
Die... die... die... die...!

DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.

He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion
crosses his face.

TWO SHOT   JULES AND VINCENT

Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems,
none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody.
Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're
as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other,
they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.

FOURTH MAN
I don't understand  

The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's
bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits
down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs
it off.

Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

VINCENT
Why the fuck didn't you tell us about
that guy in the bathroom? Slip your
mind?  Forget he was in there with a
goddamn hand cannon?

JULES
(to himself)
We should be fuckin' dead right now.
(pause)
Did you see that gun he fired at us?
It was bigger than him.

VINCENT
.357.

JULES
We should be fuckin' dead!

VINCENT
Yeah, we were lucky.

Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.

JULES
That shit wasn't luck. That shit was
somethin' else.

Vincent prepares to leave.

VINCENT
Yeah, maybe.

JULES
That was... divine intervention. You
know what divine intervention is?

VINCENT
Yeah, I think so. That means God
came down from Heaven and stopped
the bullets.

JULES
Yeah, man, that's what is means.
That's exactly what it means! God
came down from Heaven and stopped
the bullets.

VINCENT
I think we should be going now.

JULES
Don't do that! Don't you fuckin' do
that!  Don't blow this shit off!
What just happened was a fuckin'
miracle!

VINCENT
Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit
happens.

JULES
Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn't just
happen.

VINCENT
Do you wanna continue this theological
discussion in the car, or at the
jailhouse with the cops?

JULES
We should be fuckin' dead now, my
friend!  We just witnessed a miracle,
and I want you to fuckin' acknowledge
it!

VINCENT
Okay man, it was a miracle, can we
leave now?

EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING   MORNING

The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.

INT. NOVA (MOVING)   MORNING

Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and
Marvin in the back.

VINCENT
...Ever seen that show "COPS?"  I
was watchin' it once and this cop
was on it who was talkin' about this
time he got into this gun fight with
a guy in a hallway. He unloads on
this guy and he doesn't hit anything.
And these guys were in a hallway.
It's a freak, but it happens.

JULES
If you wanna play blind man, then go
walk with a Shepherd. But me, my
eyes are wide fuckin' open.

VINCENT
What the fuck does that mean?

JULES
That's it for me. For here on in,
you can consider my ass retired.

VINCENT
Jesus Christ!

JULES
Don't blaspheme!

VINCENT
Goddammit, Jules  

JULES
  I said don't do that  

VINCENT
  you're fuckin' freakin' out!

JULES
I'm tellin' Marsellus today I'm
through.

VINCENT
While you're at it, be sure to tell
'im why.

JULES
Don't worry, I will.

VINCENT
I'll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he
laughs his ass off.

JULES
I don't give a damn if he does.

Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his
grip.

VINCENT
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

MARVIN
I don't even have an opinion.

VINCENT
C'mon, Marvin. Do you think God came
down from Heaven and stopped the
bullets?

Vincent's .45 goes BANG!

Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES
blood and SHAKES.

JULES
What the fuck's happening?

VINCENT
I just accidentally shot Marvin in
the throat.

JULES
Why the fuck did you do that?

VINCENT
I didn't mean to do it. I said it
was an accident.

JULES
I've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in
my time  

VINCENT
  chill out, man, it was an accident,
okay? You hit a bump or somethin'
and the gun went off.

JULES
The car didn't hit no motherfuckin'
bump!

VINCENT
Look! I didn't mean to shoot this
son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went
off, don't ask me how!

JULES
Look at this mess! We're drivin'
around on a city street in broad
daylight  

VINCENT
  I know, I know, I wasn't thinkin'
about the splatter.

JULES
Well you better be thinkin' about it
now, motherfucker! We gotta get this
car off the road. Cops tend to notice
shit like you're driving a car
drenched in fuckin' blood.

VINCENT
Can't we just take it to a friendly
place?

JULES
This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus
don't got no friendly places in the
Valley.

VINCENT
Well, don't look at me, this is your
town, Jules.

Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.

VINCENT
Who ya callin'?

JULES
A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.

VINCENT
Where's Toluca Lake.

JULES
On the other side of the hill, by
Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass
ain't home, I don't know what the
fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any
other partners in 818.
(into phone)
Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules.
(pause)
Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are
in some serious shit. We're in a car
we gotta get off the road, pronto! I
need to use your garage for a couple
hours.

INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM   DAY

Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while
Vincent stands behind him.

JULES
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate
with this Jimmie's situation. He's
one remark away from kickin' our
asses out the door.

VINCENT
If he kicks us out, whadda we do?

JULES
Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made
a couple phone calls. But I never
want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's
my friend and you don't bust in your
friend's house and start tellin' 'im
what's what.

Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at
the sink.

VINCENT
Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He
kinda freaked out back there when he
saw Marvin.

JULES
Put yourself in his position. It's
eight o'clock in the morning. He
just woke up, he wasn't prepared for
this shit. Don't forget who's doin'
who a favor.

Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.

VINCENT
If the price of that favor is I gotta
take shit, he can stick his favor
straight up his ass.

When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is
stained with red.

JULES
What the fuck did you just do to his
towel?

VINCENT
I was just dryin' my hands.

JULES
You're supposed to wash 'em first.

VINCENT
You watched me wash 'em.

JULES
I watched you get 'em wet.

VINCENT
I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to
get off. Maybe if he had some Lava,
I coulda done a better job.

JULES
I used the same soap you did and
when I dried my hands, the towel
didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie
pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who
cares? But it's shit like this that's
gonna bring this situation to a boil.
If he were to come in here and see
that towel like that... I'm tellin'
you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause
if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie
on account of you... Look, I ain't
threatenin' you, I respect you an'
all, just don't put me in that
position.

JULES
Jules, you ask me nice like that, no
problem. He's your friend, you handle
him.

INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN   MORNING

Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug
of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in
his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.

JULES
Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious
gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda
been satisfied with freeze-dried
Tasters Choice. You spring this
gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What
flavor is this?

JIMMIE
Knock it off, Julie.

JULES
What?

JIMMIE
I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can
stop butterin' me up. I don't need
you to tell me how good my coffee
is. I'm the one who buys it, I know
how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie
goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy
the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause
when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
But what's on my mind at this moment
isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's
the dead nigger in my garage.

JULES
Jimmie  

JIMMIE
  I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a
question, Jules. When you drove in
here, did you notice a sign out front
that said, "Dead nigger storage?"

Jules starts to "Jimmie" him  

JIMMIE
  answer to question. Did you see a
sign out in front of my house that
said, "Dead nigger storage?"

JULES
(playing along)
Naw man, I didn't.

JIMMIE
You know why you didn't see that
sign?

JULES
Why?

JIMMIE
'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my
fuckin' business!

Jules starts to "Jimmie" him.

JIMMIE
  I ain't through! Now don't you
understand that if Bonnie comes home
and finds a dead body in her house,
I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage
counselor, no trial separation  
fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna
get fuckin' divorced. The last time
me an' Bonnie talked about this shit
was gonna be the last time me an'
Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I
wanna help ya out Julie, I really
do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife
doin' it.

JULES
Jimmie  

JIMMIE
  don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I
can't be Jimmied. There's nothin'
you can say that's gonna make me
forget I love my wife. Now she's
workin' the graveyard shift at the
hospital. She'll be comin' home in
less than an hour and a half. Make
your phone calls, talk to your people,
than get the fuck out of my house.

JULES
That's all we want. We don't wanna
fuck up your shit. We just need to
call our people to bring us in.

JIMMIE
Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's
in my bedroom.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM   MORNING

Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy
robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.

MARSELLUS
...well, say she comes home. Whaddya
think she'll do?
(pause)
No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That
ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er,
I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little?

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM   MORNING

Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.

JULES
You got to appreciate what an
explosive element this Bonnie
situation is. If she comes home from
a hard day's work and finds a bunch
of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta'
shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin'
what she's apt to do.

MARSELLUS
I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm
doin' is contemplating the "ifs."

JULES
I don't wanna hear about no
motherfuckin' "ifs."What I wanna
hear from your ass is: "you ain't
got no problems, Jules. I'm on the
motherfucker. Go back in there, chill
them niggers out and wait for the
cavalry, which should be comin'
directly."

MARSELLUS
You ain't got no problems, Jules.
I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in
there, chill them niggers out and
wait for The Wolf, who should be
comin' directly.

JULES
You sendin' The Wolf?

MARSELLUS
Feel better?

JULES
Shit Negro, that's all you had to
say.

INT. HOTEL SUITE   MORNING

The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite
into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a
fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in
fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing:
Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the
tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka "THE WOLF". We also see The
Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.

THE WOLF
(into phone)
Is she the hysterical type?
(pause)
When she due?
(jotting down)
Give me the principals' names again?
(jots down)
Jules...

We SEE his book. The page has written on it:

"1265 Riverside Drive Toluca Lake 1 body (no head)
Bloody shot-up car Jules (black)"

THE WOLF
...Vincent... Jimmie... Bonnie...

HE WRITES:

"Vincent (Dean Martin) Jimmie (house) Bonnie (9:30)"

THE WOLF
Expect a call around 10:30. It's
about thirty minutes away. I'll be
there in ten.

He hangs up. We never see his face.

CUT TO:

TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:

"NINE MINUTES AND THIRTY-SEVEN SECONDS LATER"

CUT TO:

EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET   MORNING

A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home,
in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a
dime in front of Jimmie's house.

A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.

INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE   MORNING

Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the
tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at
Jimmie.

THE WOLF
You're Jimmie, right? This is your
house?

JIMMIE
Yeah.

THE WOLF
(stick his hand out)
I'm Winston Wolf, I solve problems.

JIMMIE
Good, 'cause we got one.

THE WOLF
So I heard. May I come in?

JIMMIE
Please do.

In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.

THE WOLF
You must be Jules, which would make
you Vincent. Let's get down to brass
tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed
correctly, the clock is ticking, is
that right, Jimmie?

JIMMIE
100 .

THE WOLF
Your wife, Bonnie...
(refers to his pad)
...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is
that correct?

JIMMIE
Uh-huh.

THE WOLF
I was led to believe if she comes
home and finds us here, she wouldn't
appreciate it none too much.

JIMMIE
She won't at that.

THE WOLF
That gives us forty minutes to get
the fuck outta Dodge, which, if you
do what I say when I say it, should
by plenty. Now you got a corpse in a
car, minus a head, in a garage. Take
me to it.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE   MORNING

The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He
studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside,
circling it.

THE WOLF
Jimmie?

JIMMIE
Yes.

THE WOLF
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I
smelled some coffee in there. Would
you make me a cup?

JIMMIE
Sure, how do you take it?

THE WOLF
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.

THE WOLF
About the car, is there anything I
need to know? Does it stall, does it
make a lot of noise, does it smoke,
is there gas in it, anything?

JULES
Aside from how it looks, the car's
cool.

THE WOLF
Positive?  Don't get me out on the
road and I find out the brake lights
don't work.

JULES
Hey man, as far as I know, the
motherfucker's tip-top.

THE WOLF
Good enough, let's go back to the
kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN   MORNING

Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.

THE WOLF
Thank you, Jimmie.

He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the
three men the plan of action.

THE WOLF
Okay first thing, you two.
(meaning Jules and
Vincent)
Take the body, stick it in the trunk.
Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty
domesticated house. That would lead
me to believe that in the garage or
under the sink, you got a bunch of
cleansers and cleaners and shit like
that, am I correct?

JIMMIE
Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.

THE WOLF
Good. What I need you two fellas to
do is take those cleaning products
and clean the inside of the car. And
I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You
need to go in the backseat, scoop up
all those little pieces of brain and
skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe
down the upholstery   now when it
comes to upholstery, it don't need
to be spic and span, you don't need
to eat off it. Give it a good once
over. What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts. The pools
of blood that have collected, you
gotta soak that shit up.  But the
windows are a different story.  Them
you really clean. Get the Windex, do
a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to
raid your linen closet. I need
blankets, I need comforters, I need
quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker
the better, the darker the better.
No whites, can't use 'em. We need to
camouflage the interior of the car.
We're gonna line the front seat and
the backseat and the floor boards
with quilts and blankets. If a cop
stops us and starts stickin' his big
snout in the car, the subterfuge
won't last. But at a glance, the car
will appear to be normal.  Jimmie  
lead the way, boys   get to work.

The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving
Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.

VINCENT
(calling after him)
A "please" would be nice.

The Wolf stops and turns around.

THE WOLF
Come again?

VINCENT
I said a "please" would be nice.

The Wolf takes a step toward him.

THE WOLF
Set is straight, Buster. I'm not
here to say "please."I'm here to
tell you want to do. And if self-
preservation is an instinct you
possess, you better fuckin' do it
and do it quick. I'm here to help.
If my help's not appreciated, lotsa
luck gentlemen.

JULES
It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your
help is definitely appreciated.

VINCENT
I don't mean any disrespect. I just
don't like people barkin' orders at
me.

THE WOLF
If I'm curt with you, it's because
time is a factor. I think fast, I
talk fast, and I need you guys to
act fast if you want to get out of
this. So pretty please, with sugar
on top, clean the fuckin' car.

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM   MORNING

Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he
has.

The Wolf is on the phone.

THE WOLF
(into phone)
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
(pause)
White.
(pause)
Nothin', except for the mess inside.
(pause)
About twenty minutes.
(pause)
Nobody who'll be missed.
(pause)
You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon.
(he looks at Jimmie)
How we comin', Jimmie?

Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.

JIMMIE
Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand
somethin'  

THE WOLF
  Winston, Jimmie   please, Winston.

JIMMIE
You gotta understand something,
Winston. I want to help you guys out
and all, but that's my best linen.
It was a wedding present from my
Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and
they ain't with us anymore  

THE WOLF
  let me ask you a question, if you
don't mind?

JIMMIE
Sure.

THE WOLF
Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny
millionaires?

JIMMIE
No.

THE WOLF
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And
I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and
Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they
would've furnished you with a whole
bedroom set, which your Uncle
Marsellus is more than happy to do.
(takes out a roll of
bills)
I like oak myself, that's what's in
my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie,
you an oak man?

JIMMIE
Oak's nice.

INT. GARAGE   MORNING

Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up.
Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is
in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs
of brain.

Both are twice as bloody as they were before.

JULES
I will never forgive your ass for
this shit. This is some fucked-up
repugnant shit!

VINCENT
Did you ever hear the philosophy
that once a man admits he's wrong,
he's immediately forgiven for all
wrong-doings?

JULES
Man, get outta my face with that
shit! The motherfucker who said that
never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces
of skull with his fingers on account
of your dumb ass.

VINCENT
I got a threshold, Jules. I got a
threshold for the abuse I'll take.
And you're crossin' it. I'm a race
car and you got me in the red. Redline
7000, that's where you are. Just
know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be
drivin' a race car when it's in the
red. It could blow.

JULES
You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a
mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker!
Every time my fingers touch brain
I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS
OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker
usta talk about. In fact, what the
fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're
the motherfucker should be on brain
detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin'
windows and you're pickin' up this
nigger's skull.

INT. CHEVY NOVA   MORNING

The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with
bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a
portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript
vehicle.

The Wolf circles the car examining it.

Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a
bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a
good job they've done.

THE WOLF
Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out
of this yet.

JIMMIE
I can't believe that's the same car.

THE WOLF
Well, let's not start suckin' each
other's dicks quite yet. Phase one
is complete, clean the car, which
moves us right along to phase two,
clean you two.

EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD   MORNING

Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits,
covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic
Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one
of those guns nozzles attached.

THE WOLF
Strip.

VINCENT
All the way?

THE WOLF
To your bare ass.

As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.

THE WOLF
Quickly gentlemen, we got about
fifteen minutes before Jimmie's better-
half comes pulling into the driveway.

JULES
This morning air is some chilly shit.

VINCENT
Are you sure this is absolutely
necessary?

THE WOLF
You know what you two look like?

VINCENT
What?

THE WOLF
Like a couple of guys who just blew
off somebody's head. Yes, strippin'
off those bloody rags is absolutely
necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim's
garbage bag.

JULES
Now Jimmie, don't do nothin' stupid
like puttin' that out in front of
your house for Elmo the garbage man
to take away.

THE WOLF
Don't worry, we're takin' it with
us. Jim, the soap.

He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.

THE WOLF
Okay gentlemen, you're both been to
County before, I'm sure. Here it
comes.

He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.

JULES
Goddamn, that water's fuckin' cold!

THE WOLF
Better you than me, gentlemen.

The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.

THE WOLF
Don't be afraid of the soap, spread
it around.

The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.

THE WOLF
Towel 'em.

Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously
across their bodies.

THE WOLF
You're dry enough, give 'em their
clothes.

FADE UP ON:

JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They
look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses
we first met.

THE WOLF
Perfect. Perfect. We couldn't've
planned this better. You guys look
like... what do they look like,
Jimmie?

JIMMIE
Dorks. They look like a couple of
dorks.

The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.

JULES
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,
motherfucker.

JIMMIE
I guess you just gotta know how to
wear them.

JULES
Yeah, well, our asses ain't the expert
on wearin' dorky shit that your is.

THE WOLF
C'mon, gentlemen, we're laughin' and
jokin' our way into prison. Don't
make me beg.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE   MORNING

The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin.
The Wolf SLAMS is closed.

THE WOLF
Gentlemen, let's get our rules of
the road straight. We're going to a
place called Monster Joe's Truck and
Tow. Monster Joe and his daughter
Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma.
The place is North Hollywood, so a
few twist and turns aside, we'll be
goin' up Hollywood Way. Now I'll
drive the tainted car. Jules, you
ride with me.  Vincent, you follow
in my Porsche. Now if we cross the
path of any John Q. Laws, nobody
does a fuckin' thing 'til I do
something.

(TO JULES)
What did I say?

JULES
Don't do shit unless  

THE WOLF
  unless what?

JULES
Unless you do it first.

THE WOLF
Spoken like a true prodigy.
(to Vincent)
How 'bout you, Lash Larue?  Can you
keep your spurs from jingling and
jangling?

VINCENT
I'm cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went
off, I dunno how.

THE WOLF
Fair enough.
(he throws Vince his
car keys)
I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep
up. If I get my car back any different
than I gave it, Monster Joe's gonna
be disposing of two bodies.

EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW   MORNING

Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.

JULES
We cool?

WINSTON
Like it never happened.

Jules and Vincent bump fists.

WINSTON
Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all
this will be hers.

RAQUEL
(to the boys)
Hi. You know, if they ever do "I
SPY: THE MOTION PICTURE," you guys,
I'd be great.  What's with the
outfits. You guys going to a
volleyball game?

Winston laughs, the boys groan.

WINSTON
I'm takin' m'lady out to breakfast.
Maybe I can drop you two off. Where
do you live?

VINCENT
Redondo Beach.

JULES
Inglewood.

Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a
"DEAD ZONE" trance.

WINSTON
(painfully)
It's your future: I see... a cab
ride.
(dropping the act)
Sorry guys, move out of the sticks.
(to Raquel)
Say goodbye, Raquel.

RAQUEL
Goodbye, Raquel.

WINSTON
I'll see you two around, and stay
outta trouble, you crazy kids.

Winston turns to leave.

JULES
Mr. Wolf.

He turns around.

JULES
I was a pleasure watchin' you work.

The Wolf smiles.

WINSTON
Call me Winston.

He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.

WINSTON
You hear that, young lady? Respect.
You could lean a lot from those two
fine specimens. Respect for one's
elders shows character.

RAQUEL
I have character.

WINSTON
Just because you are a character
doesn't mean you have character.

RAQUEL
Oh you're so funny, oh you're so
funny.

The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.

The two men left alone look at each other.

JULES
Wanna share a cab?

VINCENT
You know I could go for some
breakfast.  Want to have breakfast
with me?

JULES
Sure.

INT. COFFEE SHOP   MORNING

Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a
big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto.
Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a
muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a
refill for both men,

VINCENT
Thanks a bunch.
(to Jules, who's
nursing his coffee)
Want a sausage?

JULES
Naw, I don't eat pork.

VINCENT
Are you Jewish?

JULES
I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig
on swine.

VINCENT
Why not?

JULES
They're filthy animals. I don't eat
filthy animals.

VINCENT
Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste
good.

JULES
A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin
pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if
it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy
motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in
shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't
wanna eat nothin' that ain't got
enough sense to disregard its own
feces.

VINCENT
How about dogs? Dogs eat their own
feces.

JULES
I don't eat dog either.

VINCENT
Yes, but do you consider a dog to be
a filthy animal?

JULES
I wouldn't go so far as to call a
dog filthy, but they're definitely
dirty. But a dog's got personality.
And personality goes a long way.

VINCENT
So by that rationale, if a pig had a
better personality, he's cease to be
a filthy animal?

JULES
We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one
motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd
have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.

The two men laugh.

VINCENT
Good for you. Lighten up a little.
You been sittin' there all quiet.

JULES
I just been sittin' here thinkin'.

VINCENT
(mouthful of food)
About what?

JULES
The miracle we witnessed.

VINCENT
The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed
a freak occurrence.

JULES
Do you know that a miracle is?

VINCENT
An act of God.

JULES
What's an act of God?

VINCENT
I guess it's when God makes the
impossible possible. And I'm sorry
Jules, but I don't think what happened
this morning qualifies.

JULES
Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't
matter. You're judging this thing
the wrong way. It's not about what.
It could be God stopped the bullets,
he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found
my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge
shit like this based on merit. Whether
or not what we experienced was an
according-to-Hoyle miracle is
insignificant. What is significant
is I felt God's touch, God got
involved.

VINCENT
But why?

JULES
That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I
don't know why. But I can't go back
to sleep.

VINCENT
So you're serious, you're really
gonna quit?

JULES
The life, most definitely.

Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In
the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.

PATRON
Garcon! Coffee!

We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene
of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.

VINCENT
So if you're quitting the life,
what'll you do?

JULES
That's what I've been sitting here
contemplating. First, I'm gonna
deliver this case to Marsellus. Then,
basically, I'm gonna walk the earth.

VINCENT
What do you mean, walk the earth?

JULES
You know, like Caine in "KUNG FU."
Just walk from town to town, meet
people, get in adventures.

VINCENT
How long do you intend to walk the
earth?

JULES
Until God puts me where he want me
to be.

VINCENT
What if he never does?

JULES
If it takes forever, I'll wait
forever.

VINCENT
So you decided to be a bum?

JULES
I'll just be Jules, Vincent   no
more, no less.

VINCENT
No Jules, you're gonna be like those
pieces of shit out there who beg for
change. They walk around like a bunch
of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in
garbage bins, they eat what I throw
away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got
a word for 'em, they're called bums.
And without a job, residence, or
legal tender, that's what you're
gonna be   a fuckin' bum!

JULES
Look my friend, this is just where
me and you differ  

VINCENT
  what happened was peculiar   no
doubt about it   but it wasn't water
into wine.

JULES
All shapes and sizes, Vince.

VINCENT
Stop fuckin' talkin' like that!

JULES
If you find my answers frightening,
Vincent, you should cease askin'
scary questions.

VINCENT
I gotta take a shit. To be continued.

Vincent exits for the restroom.

Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin
and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.

PUMPKIN
Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!

HONEY BUNNY
Any of you fuckin' pricks move and
I'll execute every one of you
motherfuckers!  Got that?!

Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the
table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it
out, COCKING IT.

PUMPKIN
Customers stay seated, waitresses on
the floor.

HONEY BUNNY
Now mean fuckin' now! Do it or die,
do it or fucking die!

Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While
Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them
terrified.

PUMPKIN
You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out
here!  Asta luego!

Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.

PUMPKIN
On the floor or I'll cook you ass,
comprende?

They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.

MANAGER
I'm the manager here, there's no
problem, no problem at all  

Pumpkin heads his way.

PUMPKIN
You're gonna give me a problem?

He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the
Manager's neck.

PUMPKIN
What? You said you're gonna give me
a problem?

MANAGER
No, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you
any problem!

PUMPKIN
I don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks
like the hero type to me!

HONEY BUNNY
Don't take any chances. Execute him!

The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his
hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.

MANAGER
Please don't! I'm not a hero. I'm
just a coffee shop manager. Take
anything you want.

PUMPKIN
Tell everyone to cooperate and it'll
be all over.

MANAGER
Everybody just be calm and cooperate
with them and this will be all over
soon!

PUMPKIN
Well done, now git your fuckin' ass
on the ground.

INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM   MORNING

Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside,
reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book.

INT. COFFEE SHOP   MORNING

Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from
the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter
with a trash bag in his hand.

PUMPKIN
Okay people, I'm going to go 'round
and collect your wallets. Don't talk,
just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his
.45 ready to spit under the table.

Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet,
briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more
respectful, him manner more on guard.

PUMPKIN
In the bag.

Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer,
Pumpkin points to the briefcase.

PUMPKIN
What's in that?

JULES
My boss' dirty laundry.

PUMPKIN
You boss makes you do his laundry?

JULES
When he wants it clean.

PUMPKIN
Sounds like a shit job.

JULES
Funny, I've been thinkin' the same
thing.

PUMPKIN
Open it up.

Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.

JULES
'Fraid I can't do that.

Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the
gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the
hammer.

PUMPKIN
I didn't hear you.

JULES
Yes, you did.

This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard
it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.

HONEY BUNNY
What's goin' on?

PUMPKIN
Looks like we got a vigilante in our
midst.

HONEY BUNNY
Shoot 'em in the face!

JULES
I don't mean to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time I've
had gun pointed at me.

PUMPKIN
You don't open up that case, it's
gonna be the last.

MANAGER
(on the ground)
Quit causing problems, you'll get us
all killed! Give 'em what you got
and get 'em out of here.

JULES
Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat
man, this ain't any of your goddamn
business!

PUMPKIN
I'm countin' to three, and if your
hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna
unload right in your fuckin' face.
Clear? One...

PUMPKIN
...two... three.

JULES
You win.

Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.

JULES
It's all yours, Ringo.

PUMPKIN
Open it.

Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to
Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case.
Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across
the room, can't see shit.

HONEY BUNNY
What is it? What is it?

PUMPKIN
(softly)
Is that what I think it is?

Jules nods his head: "yes."

PUMPKIN
It's beautiful.

Jules nods his head: "yes."

HONEY BUNNY
Goddammit, what is it?

Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering
the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to
pick up the case.

Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of
Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand
comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45
hand under Pumpkin's chin.

Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.

HONEY BUNNY
Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow
your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya!
I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're
gonna fuckin' die bad!

JULES
(to Pumpkin)
Tell that bitch to be cool! Say,
bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!

PUMPKIN
Chill out, honey!

HONEY BUNNY
Let him go!

JULES
(softly)
Tell her it's gonna be okay.

PUMPKIN
I'm gonna be okay.

JULES
Promise her.

PUMPKIN
I promise.

JULES
Tell her to chill.

PUMPKIN
Just chill out.

JULES
What's her name?

PUMPKIN
Yolanda.

Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only
at Pumpkin.

JULES
(to Yolanda)
So, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna
do anything stupid, are we?

YOLANDA
(crying)
Don't you hurt him.

JULES
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're
gonna be like three Fonzies. And
what' Fonzie like?

No answer.

JULES
C'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?

YOLANDA
(through tears, unsure)
He's cool?

JULES
Correct-amundo! And that's what we're
gonna be, we're gonna be cool.
(to Pumpkin)
Now Ringo, I'm gonna count to three
and I want you to let go your gun
and lay your palms flat on the table.
But when you do it, do it cool. Ready?

Pumpkin looks at him.

JULES
One... two... three.

Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.

Yolanda can't stand it anymore.

YOLANDA
Okay, now let him go!

JULES
Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be
cool.  When you yell at me, it makes
me nervous.  When I get nervous, I
get scared. And when motherfuckers
get scared, that's when motherfuckers
get accidentally shot.

YOLANDA
(more conversational)
Just know: you hurt him, you die.

JULES
That seems to be the situation. Now
I don't want that and you don't want
that and Ringo here don't want that.
So let's see what we can do.
(to Ringo)
Now this is the situation. Normally
both of your asses would be dead as
fuckin' fried chicken. But you
happened to pull this shit while I'm
in a transitional period. I don't
wanna kill ya, I want to help ya.
But I'm afraid I can't give you the
case. It don't belong to me. Besides,
I went through too much shit this
morning on account of this case to
just hand it over to your ass.

VINCENT (O.S.)
What the fuck's goin' on here?

Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at
Yolanda.

JULES
It's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't
do a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's
cool baby, nothin's changed. We're
still just talkin'.
(to Pumpkin)
Tell her we're still cool.

PUMPKIN
It's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still
cool.

VINCENT
(gun raised)
What the hell's goin' on, Jules?

JULES
Nothin' I can't handle. I want you
to just hang back and don't do shit
unless it's absolutely necessary.

VINCENT
Check.

JULES
Yolanda, how we doin, baby?

YOLANDA
I gotta go pee! I want to go home.

JULES
Just hang in there, baby, you're
doing' great, Ringo's proud of you
and so am I.  It's almost over.
(to Pumpkin)
Now I want you to go in that bag and
find my wallet.

PUMPKIN
Which one is it?

JULES
It's the one that says Bad
Motherfucker on it.

Pumpkin looks in the bag and   sure enough   there's a wallet
with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.

JULES
That's my bad motherfucker. Now open
it up and take out the cash. How
much is there?

PUMPKIN
About fifteen hundred dollars.

JULES
Put it in your pocket, it's yours.
Now with the rest of them wallets
and the register, that makes this a
pretty successful little score.

VINCENT
Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen
hundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on
general principle.

JULES
You ain't gonna do a goddamn thing,
now hang back and shut the fuck up.
Besides, I ain't givin' it to him.
I'm buyin' somethin' for my money.
Wanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?

PUMPKIN
What?

JULES
Your life. I'm givin' you that money
so I don't hafta kill your ass. You
read the Bible?

PUMPKIN
Not regularly.

JULES
There's a passage I got memorized.
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides
by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of the darkness. For he
is truly his brother's keeper and
the finder of lost children. And I
will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know I am the
Lord when I lay my vengeance upon
you." I been sayin' that shit for
years.  And if you ever heard it, it
meant your ass. I never really
questioned what it meant. I thought
it was just a coldblooded thing to
say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped
a cap in his ass. But I saw some
shit this mornin' made me think twice.
Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're
the evil man. And I'm the righteous
man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the
shepherd protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness. Or is
could by you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd and it's the
world that's evil and selfish.  I'd
like that. But that shit ain't the
truth. The truth is you're the weak.
And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But
I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to
be a shepherd.

Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.

Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to
Yolanda.

She looks back.

Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the
door.

Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time,
takes a sip of coffee.

JULES
(to himself)
It's cold.

He pushes it aside.

Vincent appears next to Jules.

VINCENT
I think we oughta leave now.

JULES
That's probably a good idea.

Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the
briefcase.

Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the
Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes
  wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts,
swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics   walk out of
the coffee shop together without saying a word.

FADE OUT

THE END

FINAL DRAFT

March 16, 1994





FADE IN:

1   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                           1

A vast and sparkling starfield. A pinpoint of LIGHT
appears and starts moving toward the camera... a small
and distant cylindrical object tumbling end over end,
but we can't determine exactly what it is yet...

2   EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY                                        2

A vast and undulating sea of wheat. We become aware
that there are two HEADS sticking out of the stalks of
wheat: two men are standing and looking up at the
sky. As we move towards them,  we begin to hear their
conversation...and we can see that the two men are
SCOTTY and CHEKOV, dressed in civilian clothing.

CHEKOV
(points to sky)
There he is -- there, to the
South!

SCOTTY
(peers upward)
What are ye, blind? That's a
bird.

As they stare up at the sky...

3   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                           3

The cylinder tumbling through space is now closer, and
we can now see that it is a BOTTLE of some sort, and it
is tumbling directly toward the camera...

4   EXT. WHEATFIELD- DAY                                         4

As before, Chekov and Scotty staring at the sky.

SCOTTY
(concerned)
Repelling the Crystalline
Trench... rafting down lava
flows... orbital skydiving. it's
like the man is running a bloody
decathlon across the galaxy.

Suddenly we hear a double SONIC BOOM.

CHEKOV
(re: sound)
That should be him now. I think
he's just crossed the sound
barrier.

They shield their eyes against the sun and look up.

5   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                           5

The bottle gets CLOSER...

6   EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY                                        6

A man in a high-tech body harness and parachute LANDS
in the wheat flat on his back. His body-suit is
charred, scorched, wisps of smoke still curling off of
it. There are small thrusters attached to his backpack
and boots. Scotty and Chekov move to him. The man
removes his helmet. Revealing that it is KIRK. He
smiles broadly, like a child who has just come off a
roller-coaster.

KIRK
Right on target! I jump out over
the Arabian Peninsula... and I end
up here, right on the dime.

Kirk gets to his feet.

CHEKOV
Actually, Captain, your precise
target area was thirty-five
meters...
(points)
That way.

KIRK
Thanks for pointing that out.

Kirk starts to pull off his suit, reacts to a sudden
pain in his back.

KIRK
Oh...

SCOTTY
I've warned ye about that back of
yours. You should have a doctor
take a look at it.

Kirk waves him away, and continues to remove his
harness.

6A   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                          6A

The tumbling bottle rushes past, and we can now see
that it is a CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE - Dom Perignon, 2265.
Follow the bottle as it tumbles through space...

6B   EXT. WHEATFIELD - DAY                                       6B

Kirk, Scotty and Chekov as before.

KIRK
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-
elliptical jump. That's where you
jump out over Northern China, and
make three complete orbits before
you start re-entry...

CHEKOV
Captain. Perhaps you have
forgotten that tomorrow is the
christening ceremony.

This strikes a nerve with Kirk -- we see a flash of
hesitation and irritation cross his face.

KIRK
I'm not going.
(beat)
Scotty, help me with this chute.

SCOTTY
What do you mean, you're not
going? We promised.

KIRK
When I retired, I swore I'd never
set foot on a starship again, and
I meant it.

CHEKOV
Captain...

KIRK
(firm)
I don't want to hear anymore about
it. I'm not going, and that's
final.

7   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                           7

The champagne bottle SMASHES onto the bow of a
Federation starship(Excelsior class) sitting in its
dock in orbit around Earth.

7A   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                          7A

FOLLOW the shards of glass from the bottle as they
spread over the ship...revealing the name on the hull:
U.S.S. ENTERPRISE NCC-1701-B.

8   ANGLE ON SPACEDOCK WINDOW                                    8

A large picture window overlooking the starship in its
berth. The window is filled with people in Starfleet
uniforms, applauding the christening of the ship (but
we hear nothing).

8A   INT. SPACEDOCK OBSERVATION ROOM (VFX-I)                     8A

The people are still applauding and we can see that
they are looking out over the ship in its berth.

8B   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B IN SPACEDOCK (VFX-I)              8B

The great ship sits in spacedock.

9   INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE                                   9

CLOSE ON A SET OF TURBOLIFT DOORS as they slide open to
reveal Kirk, Scotty and Chekov. A bright light shines
into their faces and they react. MOVE TO REVEAL -
that the bright light is coming from a futuristic
CAMERA with a small bank of lights attached to it. The
camera is a holographic recorder with two lenses and is
worn on an operator's head. There are four JOURNALISTS
clustered in front of the Turbolift -- one associated
with the camera, the others using PADDS to make
notations.

Also clustered around the door are the BRIDGE CREW of
the Enterprise-B. Everyone is APPLAUDING as Kirk and
the others blink under the bright lights and ENTER the
Bridge.

JOURNALISTS
(overlapping)
Captain Kirk, how does it feel
to be back on the Enterprise
Bridge... Captain, can I have a
Minute... Captain Scott, do you
have any comment on... Commander
Chekov... etc.

CAPTAIN JOHN HARRIMAN pushes through the crowd.

HARRIMAN
Excuse me, excuse me...there will
be plenty of time for questions
later...

The journalists edge away, and the cameraman moves to
get a good angle.

HARRIMAN
(continuing, to all)
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd
like to welcome you all aboard.

KIRK
It's our pleasure.

Harriman is young, confident, eager -- this is his
first command and he takes it very seriously.

HARRIMAN
I just want you to know how
excited we all are to have a group
of living legends with us on our
maiden voyage.
(beat)
I remember reading about your
missions when I was in grade
school.

The original Enterprise officers all stop and give him
a look. Harriman looks a little embarrassed -- he
didn't mean to insult them. But Kirk gives him a
little smile, lets it roll off.

KIRK
Well... may we have a look around?

HARRIMAN
Please... please.

Chekov sees someone in the background, calls out to
her.

CHEKOV
Demora!

Chekov moves off.

JOURNALIST
(breezy)
So, Captain... this is the first
Starship Enterprise in thirty
years without James T. Kirk in
command. How do you feel about
that?

The Journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve. Kirk's
eyes flash for a moment -- the longer he's on this
Bridge, the more he realizes he doesn't feel good about
it at all. He tries to shrug it off with a smile.

KIRK
Just fine. I'm glad to be here to
send her on her way...

He tries to move away from the Journalist, who dogs
him.

JOURNALIST
What have you been doing since you
retired?

KIRK
I've been... keeping busy.

At this point, Chekov approaches with a young, (mid-
twenties) attractive, Asian female Ensign named DEMORA.

CHEKOV
(to Kirk)
Excuse me, Captain. I'd like you
to meet the Helmsman of the
Enterprise-B. Ensign Demora Sulu --
Captain James Kirk.

DEMORA
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
My father's told me some...
interesting stories about you.

Kirk is shocked. For a long moment, he stares at her
in amazement.

KIRK
Your father... Hikaru Sulu is your
father?

DEMORA
Yes, sir.

CHEKOV
You met her once before, but she
was...

Chekov holds out his hand and indicates a very short
height.

KIRK
But that wasn't so long ago... it
couldn't have been more than...

CHEKOV
Twelve years, sir.

KIRK
Yes... well... congratulations,
Ensign. It wouldn't be the
Enterprise without a Sulu at the
helm.

DEMORA
Thank you, sir.
(to Chekov)
Let me show you the new inertial
guidance system.

Demora and Chekov move off and Kirk looks after them
for a long beat. The expression on his face changes
from shock to sadness... Something is clearly
bothering him.

Scotty moves over to Kirk, with a smile on his face.

SCOTTY
(to Kirk)
Damn fine ship if you ask me...

But Kirk's mind is still on Demora. He watches her as
she moves to the Helmsman's position.

KIRK
You know, Scotty... it amazes me.

SCOTTY
And what would that be, sir?

KIRK
Sulu. When did he find the time
for a family?

SCOTTY
It's like you always said -- if
something's important enough, you
make the time.

Kirk nods absently. Scotty realizes something...

SCOTTY
So... that's why you've been
running around the galaxy like an
eighteen-year-old. Finding
retirement a little lonely, are we?

Kirk gives him a look.

KIRK
With that kind of tact, I'm glad
you're an engineer and not a
psychiatrist.

Harriman interrupts.

HARRIMAN
Excuse me, gentlemen... if you'll
take your seats.

KIRK
Oh... of course.

10   NEW ANGLE                                                   10

Revealing that three CHAIRS have been neatly arranged
to one side.

Scotty, Kirk and Chekov all take their seats. The
Journalists take positions on the opposite side of the
Bridge. Harriman moves to the command chair and the
rest of the Bridge crew go to their stations.

HARRIMAN
(to all)
Prepare to leave spacedock. Aft
thrusters ahead one quarter, port
and starboard at station keeping.
(beat)
Captain Kirk, I'd be honored if
you would give the order to get
underway.

KIRK
No... no. Thank you.

HARRIMAN
Please, I insist.

All eyes on Kirk -- he has little choice. He stands
uncomfortably. There is a moment of anticipation.

KIRK
(to all)
Take us out.

Everyone breaks into APPLAUSE. Kirk sits down in
acute embarrassment and  annoyance.

CHEKOV
(sotto)
Very good, sir.

SCOTTY
(sotto)
Brought a tear to my eye.

CUT TO:

11    EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)                            11

The great ship majestically LEAVES the dock, and heads
out into open space, passing DIRECTLY OVERHEAD.

12    INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE                                  12

A short time later. Harriman turns to his guests.

HARRIMAN
Well... we've just cleared the
asteroid belt. Our course will
take us out beyond Pluto and then
back to spacedock. Just a quick
run around the block.
(beat)
If we have time, we'll conduct a
few tests of the warp --

Suddenly the communications console starts to BEEP.
The COM OFFICER hits a few commands in response.

COM OFFICER
(to Harriman)
We're picking up a distress call,
Captain.

This grabs everyone's attention.

HARRIMAN
On speakers.

We hear the voice of a crewmember who sounds panicked
and urgent.

COM VOICE
(fritzed)
This is the transport ship Lakul.
We're caught in some kind of
energy distortion. We can't break
free... need immediate help...
It' tearing us --

The voice is drowned out by STATIC. The SCIENCE
OFFICER checks something on his console. The
Journalist with the Holo-camera turns on his light and
pans it around to capture the action.

SCIENCE OFFICER
The Lakul is one of two ships
transporting El-Aurian refugees to
Earth.

Harriman blinks a couple of times, surprised at this
unexpected turn of  events. Kirk watches him intently.
Harriman clears his throat, then turns to Demora.

HARRIMAN
Can you locate them?

DEMORA
The ships are bearing at three one
zero mark two one five. Distance:
Three light years.

HARRIMAN
Signal the closest starship.
We're in no condition to mount a
rescue... We don't even have a
full crew aboard.

The NAVIGATOR checks his console.

NAVIGATOR
We're the only one in range, sir.

The Holo-camera light is shined on Harriman as he
shifts in his seat, hesitant to take the plunge. Kirk
is drumming his fingers impatiently on his leg.
Finally, Harriman takes a breath and straightens his
jacket a bit.

HARRIMAN
Well, then... I guess it's up to
us.
(to Demora)
Helm, lay in an intercept course
and engage at maximum warp.

Kirk fidgets in his chair, itching to get in on the
action - his instincts taking over. Scotty shoots him
a side-long glance.

SCOTTY
Is there something wrong with your
chair, Captain?

Kirk gives him a look.

13   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)                           13

The ship snaps into warp.

14   INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE                                  14

A few minutes later. Demora is watching her console.

DEMORA
We're within visual range of the
energy distortion, Captain.

HARRIMAN
On screen.

15   INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I)                                  15

Which now shows a HUGE RIBBON OF CRACKLING ENERGY
directly ahead of the Enterprise-B.

Everyone reacts to the bizarre sight.

CHEKOV
What the hell is that?

DEMORA
(off console)
I've found the transport ships.

15A   INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I)                                 15A

The Viewscreen now shows TWO TRANSPORT SHIPS trapped
like insects in the violent torrent of energy. The
ships are being buffeted and thrown about by large
TENDRILS of CRACKLING ENERGY.

DEMORA
(cont'd)
Their hulls are starting to buckle
under the stress -- they won't
survive much longer.

The ship suddenly SHAKES. The Navigator works his
console.

NAVIGATOR
We're encountering severe
gravimetric distortions from the
energy ribbon.

HARRIMAN
We'll have to keep our distance...
we don't want to get pulled in
too...

Harriman frowns at the screen, trying to figure out
what to do. Kirk can barely contain himself -- to him
the answer is obvious. He blurts out the answer --

KIRK
Tractor beam...

Scotty quickly elbows him in the side -- this isn't
Kirk's ship. Kirk shuts up.  Harriman glances at Kirk.

HARRIMAN
We don't have a tractor beam.

KIRK
You left spacedock without a
tractor beam?

HARRIMAN
It won't be installed until
Tuesday.
(beat)
Ensign Sulu... try generating a
subspace field around the ships.
That might break them free.

DEMORA
Aye, sir.

When Kirk hears this order, he shakes his head slightly
and mouths the word "no" under his breath. He knows
that won't work.

DEMORA
(continuing; shakes her
head)
There's too much quantum
interference, Captain.

Harriman frowns again, trying to come up with another
solution, but it isn't easy -- it's his first day in
command; his ship is under-manned and ill-prepared.
It's a nightmare come true. Kirk is itching to get in
On this, his fingers digging into the arms of his chair --
but he restrains himself.

HARRIMAN
What about... venting plasma from
the warp nacelles? That might
disrupt the ribbon's hold on the
ships.

NAVIGATOR
Aye, sir.. releasing drive
plasma...

A tense beat. Harriman glances over at the
journalists, then glances over at Kirk. Kirk gives him
a pained smile, trying to be encouraging even though he
knows this is not the right course of action.

NAVIGATOR
(continuing)
It's not having any effect, sir.
I think --

DEMORA
Sir! The starboard vessel's hull
is collapsing --

15B   INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I)                                 15B

Suddenly the right-hand ship on the screen is engulfed
by a fiery TENDRIL of energy and it EXPLODES. The
other ship continues to be thrown about and buffeted.
Everyone reacts with shock on the Bridge.

CHEKOV
How many people were aboard
that ship?

DEMORA
Two hundred sixty-five.

Harriman pales at the sight... seems shell-shocked by
the destruction of the ship. He's overwhelmed now, at
a genuine loss as to what to do next.

DEMORA
(urgent)
The Lakul's hull integrity is down
to twelve percent, sir.

Harriman looks over at Kirk, who has remained quiet
during this entire sequence only through great effort
and out of deference to the young Captain. This is a
delicate moment -- Harriman doesn't want to look
incapable, but at the same time, he needs help.

HARRIMAN
Captain Kirk... I would appreciate
any... suggestions you might have.

Kirk is out of his chair like a cork out of a bottle.
He moves down to stand next to Harriman.

KIRK
(sotto)
First -- move us within
transporter range and beam those
people to the Enterprise.

Harriman looks at him with surprise.

HARRIMAN
What about the gravimetric
distortions? They'll tear us
apart...

KIRK
(gently)
Risk is part of the game if you
want to sit in that chair.

Kirk gives him a supportive look. Harriman buckles
down and grimly looks at the image on the screen.

HARRIMAN
Helm, close to within transporter
range.

Kirk glances at the Cameraman, who's still shining the
light on them  all.

KIRK
And second -- turn that damned
thing off.

The cameraman turns OFF the light.

CUT TO:

16   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)                           16

The ship edges in yet closer to the crackling ribbon.
The tendrils from the ribbon lash out at the ship, just
missing it.

17   INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE                                  17

As before.

DEMORA
We're within range, sir.

HARRIMAN
(to lieutenant)
Beam them directly to Sickbay.

CHEKOV
(concerned)
How big's your medical staff?

HARRIMAN
(embarrassed)
The medical staff... doesn't
arrive until Tuesday.

Chekov turns to the two journalists.

CHEKOV
You and you. You've just become
nurses. Let's go.

Chekov and the journalists EXIT to the turbolift.

DEMORA
Main Engineering reports
fluctuations in the warp plasma
relays.

SCOTTY
By-pass the relays and go to
auxiliary systems.

The LIEUTENANT is having problems at the aft console.

LIEUTENANT
Sir, I'm having trouble locking
onto them. They appear to be...
in some sort of... temporal flux.

Kirk turns to Scotty.

KIRK
Scotty?

Scotty quickly moves to look at the Transporter
console.

SCOTTY
What the hell...

Kirk moves to him.

SCOTTY
Their life signs are... are
phasing in and out of our
space-time continuum.

KIRK
Phasing? To where?

Scotty begins to work.

NAVIGATOR
Sir! Their hull's collapsing!

18   EXT. SPACE- THE LAKUL (VFX-I)                               18

The ship is destroyed by an energy tendril.

19   INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE                                  19

All eyes on Scotty.

SCOTTY
I got forty-seven of them...
(beat, grim)
... out of one hundred fifty.

Suddenly the ship is rocked violently. KLAXONS and
alarms start to wail and the lights FLICKER on and off.
BULKHEAD EXPLODES, sending metal fragments screaming
across the Bridge and KILLING the Navigator. Scotty
quickly takes over the dead man's console.

KIRK
Report!

DEMORA
We're caught in a gravimetric
field emanating from the trailing
edge of the ribbon.

HARRIMAN
All engines, full reverse!

20   EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B   RIBBON (VFX-I)                   20

The ship is turning sideways into the WAKE of the
ribbon, but cannot break away. It is clearly being
pulled along, out of control. Tendrils leap up from the
ribbon, lashing against the ship.

21   INT. ENTERPRISE-B- SICKBAY                                  21

The room is filled with the SURVIVORS of the Lakul.
They are all members of the EL-AURIAAN  race -- humanoid
and dressed in distinctive clothing. The survivors are
in various states of shock. Many sit on the floor,
staring into middle distance. some lie on tables,
unconscious. others are mumbling incoherently to
themselves. Chekov and the Journalists are moving from
person to person trying to get control of the
situation as the ship is ROCKED and FLUNG about.
Chekov has a tricorder.

SURVIVORS
(incoherent, overlapping)
The colors are touching me... I'm
caught in the glass... Help me...
I can see the seconds... Over
here... etc

CHEKOV
It will be all right. We're going
to take care of you.

He looks at the tricorder.

CHEKOV
(off tricorder)
Only minor injuries so far...
(beat)
But it looks like they're all
suffering from some kind of
neural shock.

One Journalist moves past a man sitting on a bio-bed
with a dazed look on his face. He has a nasty-looking
wound on one side of his face. (We will later learn
that this man is named DOCTOR SORAN.)

The journalist is about to turn away when suddenly
Soran GRABS him roughly -- clearly a man of great
Strength -- and pulls him close. Soran's eyes are
suddenly wild, crazed.

SORAN
Why...why?

JOURNALIST
It's all right... you're safe...
you're on the Enterprise.

SORAN
No... I have to go... I have to
get back... You don't understand!
Let me go!

Soran begins to attack the journalist, but before he
can do any real damage, Chekov injects Soran with a
hypospray and Soran falls unconscious.

JOURNALIST
What was he talking about?

Suddenly a WOMAN with her back toward us stumbles
nearby. Chekov quickly grabs her arm and catches her
before she falls.

CHEKOV
Easy there...

The woman turns around and we see her face for the
first time -- it's GUINAN. She seems dazed and
confused. Chekov smiles at her warmly.

CHEKOV
It's going to be okay. Here, just
lie down.

As he guides Guinan onto a table...

22   INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE (VFX-I)                          22

Energy ribbon on viewscreen.

DEMORA
Inertial dampers failing.

SCOTTY
Engines not responding!

Harriman is gripping the arms of his chair with one
hand. His face pales.

HARRIMAN
(quiet)
I didn't expect to die my first
day on the job.

Kirk tries to buck up the young captain.

KIRK
(sotto)
The first thing you learn as
Captain is how to cheat death.
(beat, then louder)
Scotty?

SCOTTY
(outraged)
There's just no way to disrupt a
gravimetric field of this
magnitude!

DEMORA
Hull integrity failing.

Kirk looks at Scotty expectantly for a moment.

SCOTTY
(continuing)
But I do have a theory...

KIRK
I thought you might.

SCOTTY
An anti-matter discharge directly
ahead... it might disrupt the
field long enough for us to break
away.

KIRK
A photon torpedo?

SCOTTY
Aye.

KIRK
(quickly, to Demora)
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire
on my command.

Demora turns to him.

DEMORA
Captain... we don't have any
torpedoes.

Kirk glances at Harriman.

KIRK
Don't tell me... Tuesday.

Harriman nods, a little embarrassed. The SHAKING gets
worse.

SCOTTY
Captain, it may be possible to
simulate a torpedo blast using a
resonance burst from the main
deflector dish.

KIRK
(onto the idea)
Where are the deflector relays?

DEMORA
Deck fifteen, section twenty-one
alpha

HARRIMAN
(to Kirk)
I'll go. You have the Bridge.

Harriman heads for the turbolift, and there is a moment
as Kirk is sorely tempted to take command of the ship
and sit in the Captain's chair one more time. But he
pulls himself back before Harriman can exit.

KIRK
No... a Captain's place is on the
Bridge of his ship.
(beat)
I'll take care of it.

Harriman nods in acknowledgement. Kirk heads for the
turbolift.

KIRK
(on the move, to Scotty)
Keep her together until I get
back.

SCOTTY
(matter of fact)
I always do.

Kirk smiles as the turbolift doors slide shut...

Kirk running down the corridor, opens a door.

25   INT. ENTERPRISE-B - DEFLECTOR ROOM (CONTINUOUS)             25

A small control room with a few consoles. Kirk rushes
in and rips off one of the large wall panels. He
quickly begins to re-route cabling and circuitry...

26   INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE                                  26

As before. The ship is SHAKING badly.

DEMORA
Forty-five seconds to structural
collapse!

Scotty is working the consoles frantically.

SCOTTY
Bridge to Captain Kirk.

INTERCUT:

27   INT. ENTERPRISE-B - DEFLECTOR ROOM                          27

Kirk working furiously.

KIRK
Kirk here.

SCOTTY
Captain, I don't know how much
longer I can hold her together!

Kirk finishes working and slams the wall panel closed.

KIRK
That's it. Go!

28   INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE                                  28

As before.

HARRIMAN

Activate main deflector.

Demora works the console.

29   EXT. SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)                            29

A large BURST 0F ENERGY leaps out of the main deflector
dish and EXPLODES in front of the ship. There is an
immediate reaction within the Energy Ribbon, which
roils and fluctuates in response.

30   INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE                                  30

As before.

SCOTTY
We're breaking free.

31   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)                           31

The ship now begins to turn away from the crackling
ribbon. But just as it's turning, one final TENDRIL of
energy suddenly leaps out and hits the ship.

32   OMITTED                                                     32

33   INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE                                  33

The ship is ROCKED so hard that everyone is knocked off
their feet. Gradually, the SHAKING STOPS. Demora
scrambles back into position.

DEMORA
We're clear.

Everyone reacts with relief.

HARRIMAN
(excited, to com)
You did it, Kirk!
(to Demora)
Damage report, Ensign.

DEMORA
(off console)
There's some buckling on the
starboard nacelle...
(reacts)
We've also got a hull breach in
the Engineering section.
Emergency forcefields are in place
and holding.

SCOTTY
Where?

DEMORA
Sections twenty through twenty-
eight on decks thirteen...
fourteen...
(looks at Scotty with
meaning)
... and fifteen.

Everyone turns around and looks at Scotty.

SCOTTY
(to com)
Bridge to Captain Kirk.
(beat)
Captain Kirk, please respond.

Still no response. Scotty's face falls.

SCOTTY
(continuing, to Demora)
Have Chekov meet me on deck
fifteen.

Harriman, very concerned, gets up and follows Scotty.
They EXIT to the Turbolift.

CUT TO:

34   INT. ENTERPRISE-B - CORRIDOR                                34

Scotty and Harriman head down the Corridor. They round
a bend... and then stop short. They react to
something ahead of them...

35   NEW ANGLE (VFX-P)                                           35

Revealing that the corridor ahead of them is GONE. A
jagged hole has been ripped in the ship and OPEN SPACE
can be seen beyond the twisted metal.

A FORCEFIELD flickers on and off, holding the vacuum of
space at bay.

Scotty and Harriman look at the awesome sight for a
moment. Chekov comes running up the Corridor behind
them. He stops and reacts.

CHEKOV
My God...
(beat)
Was anyone in there?

A long silent beat as Scotty looks out into space.

SCOTTY
Aye.

36   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)                           36

A huge chunk has been ripped out of the Engineering
section, looking like an open wound. Scotty, Chekov,
and Harriman can be seen standing inside the small
Corridor, looking out into space...

37   INT. ENTERPRISE-B- BRIDGE                                   37

A short time later. Scotty, Harriman and Chekov are
listening to Demora, who is working the Helm console.

DEMORA
I've checked the entire ship and
the surrounding space. there's
no sign of him.

A silent moment. Chekov looks to Scotty, hoping to
hear some sort of miracle. Scotty takes a moment
looks at the empty command chair. Then he shakes his
head. A long beat as everyone is forced to accept this
terrible truth.

SCOTTY
(quiet)
Just a quick... run around the
block.

CHEKOV
I never thought it would end like
this...

SCOTTY
All things must end, Mr. Chekov.

Harriman finally breaks the stillness of the Bridge.

HARRIMAN
Let's go home.

Harriman steps down to the Captain's chair and takes
command of his ship.

Scotty and Chekov exchange a final look. Off the
reactions of these two friends who've just lost someone
very dear to them both...

CUT TO:

38   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)                           38

the blue and white banner of the United Federation of
Planets waves in the breeze.

MOVE TO REVEAL THE LOCATION

40   EXT. SAILING VESSEL - DAY                                   40

A nineteenth-century three-masted sailing vessel (about
the size of a frigate) is hove-to and sitting in the
water gently rocking. Across the stern of the ship, we
can see the name ENTERPRISE picked out in gold letters.

41   ON THE MAIN DECK                                            41

Where PICARD and RIKER are standing before the
assembled crew of the ship. Everyone is dressed in
full-dress naval uniforms of the period, complete with
cocked hats, epaulettes, etc. The crew is standing at
attention... the wind whistles through the rigging...
the timbers creak...

Picard grimly looks over his crew... then finally  he
nods to Riker.

RIKER
Bring out the prisoner!

A drummer begins a long DRUM ROLL.

42   ON A HATCH                                                  42

as WORF is brought on deck by TROI and GEORDI. Worf is
shackled by hand and leg irons. Troi and Geordi hold
him by either arm and shove him toward the Captain.
The drum roll STOPS. Picard moves to Worf and peers at
him closely.

PICARD
Mister Worf... I always knew this
day would come. Are you prepared
to face the charges?

Worf doesn't answer and Troi jabs him in the side.

TROI
Answer him!

WORF
I am prepared.

Picard looks to Riker, who then pulls out a large,
rolled piece of parchment. He opens the scroll and
begins to read from it. In the b.g. Geordi removes
Worf's shackles.

RIKER
"We, the officers and crew of the
U.S.S. Enterprise, being of sound
mind and judgment, hereby make
the following charges against
Lieutenant Worf: One. That he did
knowingly and willfully perform
above and beyond the call of duty
on countless occasions. Two.
That he has been a good and solid
officer on this ship for one score
less twelve years. And Three.
Most seriously... that he has
earned the respect and admiration
of the entire crew."

Riker puts away the scroll

PICARD
There can be only one punishment
for such crimes...
(beat)
I hereby promote you to the rank
of Lieutenant Commander, with all
the rights and privileges thereto.
And may God have mercy on your
soul.

Everyone ROARS in APPROVAL. Picard smiles at Worf and
shakes his hand.

PICARD
(cont'd)
Congratulations, Commander.

WORF
(smiles)
Thank you, sir.

Picard continues to smile at him for a moment...then
Riker steps in.

RIKER
Extend the plank!!

Worf's face registers surprise as everyone GRABS HIM
and hauls him toward the side, where a long plank is
being pushed out over the water.

CREWMEMBERS
Into the sea with him... feed him
to the sharks... walk the
plank... etc.

Picard gives Riker a questioning look.

PICARD
Don't you think you're taking this
a little too far, Number One?

RIKER
When we went to ancient Rome for
Deanna's promotion, we threw her
to the lions, remember?

Picard shrugs it off... it's not exactly his cup of
tea, but he'll go along with it.

Worf is hustled to the rail where BEVERLY is waiting
patiently by the plank, holding a long PIKE. Worf is
put on the plank and Crusher prods him with the pike
until Worf is nearly at the end.

Worf finally stops and turns around.

WORF
(a shout)
WAIT!!

Everyone falls silent a moment. Worf looks over
the side at the water below.

WORF
(a little embarrassed)
I can't swim.

LA FORGE
(calmly, to Worf)
The Holodeck safety program is
engaged... The computer won't let
you drown.

BEVERLY
But the sharks are quite
convincing.

Beverly prods him with the pike and Worf FALLS INTO THE
SEA  with a huge SPLASH . Everyone LAUGHS and CHEERS.
Reveal DATA, who is standing near the side rail,
looking a little confused at the reaction.

DATA
(to Beverly)
Doctor, I must confess I am
uncertain as to why pushing
someone into freezing, shark-
infested water is amusing.

BEVERLY
It's all done in good fun, Data.
Get in the spirit of things.

DATA
Ah.

Data thinks a moment, then he LIFTS Beverly with one
hand and hold her over the rail.

BEVERLY
Data...Data -- !

Data lets go and Beverly PLUMMETS into the ocean. Data
looks around -- no one is laughing. They all look a
little surprised.

GEORDI
Data. that wasn't funny.

Data is puzzled by the reaction of the crowd... he's
more confused than ever.

43   PICARD AND RIKER                                            43

are standing on the quarterdeck as a very wet Beverly
comes up on deck.

PICARD
Well, now that we're all aboard...
(beat, then smiles)
Number One, bring the ship before
the wind.
(savoring the moment)
Let's see what's out there.

RIKER
Aye, aye, sir.
(to Troi)
Take the wheel, Commander.

Troi takes the ship's wheel.

RIKER
(shouts)
All hands make sail! Raise up
tacks and stand by the braces!

The crew springs into action... rushing to their places
aloft and on deck... grabbing ropes and lines...
starting to unfurl the sails... trimming the
yardarms... getting the ship ready to sail.

44                                                               44

Picard is drinking in the scene with a look of great
satisfaction and  contentment.

PICARD
Imagine what it was like, Will. No
engines... no computers... just
the wind, the sea and the stars to
guide you.

RIKER
Bad food, brutal discipline...
(beat)
No women.

But Picard won't let Riker rain on his parade -- he's
thoroughly enjoying himself.

COM VOICE
Bridge to Captain Picard.

PICARD
Picard here.

COM VOICE
There is a personal message for
you from Earth.

PICARD
(annoyed)
Put it through down here.

But the best thing about a life at
sea was that they couldn't get to
you.

Picard walks toward the bow.

PICARD

Computer, arch.

46A   ANGLE (VFX-P)                                              46A

A U-shaped ARCH with several computer panels visible
appears on the forecastle. It's a strange sight to see
a piece of the 24th century on the deck of this ship.
Picard goes to the arch and activates one of the
monitors and waits for the transmission to appear.

46B   NEW ANGLE (VFX-P)                                          46B

A text message APPEARS and he starts to read it. After
a moment, he reacts with shock and dismay to something
on the screen.

47   ON TROI                                                     47

whose attention has been drawn to Picard, at the arch.
She reacts with concern at the expression on his face.

TROI
(to crewmember)
Here. Take the wheel.

Troi moves toward the bow.

48   ON PICARD (VFX-P)                                           48

whose face is now ashen with shock. Clearly he has
just read something on the screen which is very
disturbing.

He stares into the middle distance for a moment. Troi
moves to him.

TROI
(quiet)
Captain, are you all right?

PICARD
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse
me...

He turns OFF the screen.

PICARD
Computer, exit.

48A   ANGLE (VFX-P)                                              48A

The Holodeck DOORS APPEAR within the Arch. Picard is
clearly distracted as he EXITS to the Corridor. Troi
looks after him with concern.

49   NEW ANGLE                                                   49

Favoring Riker. He takes a couple of steps toward
Worf.

RIKER
Set the royals and the studding
sails, Mister Worf.

Worf looks at him blankly for a moment.

WORF
The Royal... studs...?

RIKER
(smiles, points aloft)
You see the top yardarm, now look
to the --

Suddenly a com voice interrupts.

COM VOICE
Bridge to Commander Riker.

RIKER
Riker here.

COM VOICE
We're picking up a distress call
from the Amargosa observatory,
sir. They say they're under
attack.

RIKER
(to all)
Red Alert! All hands to
Battle stations! Captain Picard to

Everyone on the ship reacts, and there is a general
rush to the bow of the ship...

CUT TO:

50   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-D (VFX-I)                           50

The great ship at impulse. We FOLLOW it and then see
ahead of the ship, a small SOLAR OBSERVATORY with a
complex optical array. The observatory bears scorch
marks and other signs of recent battle. (In the b.g.
a YELLOW SUN can be seen.)

51   INT. BRIDGE (VFX-I)                                         51

Picard in command. Riker, Troi, Worf and Data at their
stations They didn't have time to change, so they are
all still dressed in their costumes from the ceremony.
The ship is at Red Alert. The image of the burnt-out
observatory is on the VIEWSCREEN.

RIKER
It looks like we're too late...

WORF
(off console)
There are no other ships in the
system.

DATA
Sensors show five life signs
aboard the station, Captain.

RIKER
The station complement was
nineteen.

A grim beat. Picard gets up and starts heading for the
Ready Room - his attitude is dismissive, almost
irritated that this has interrupted some deeper concern
of his.

PICARD
Secure from Red Alert. Number
One, begin an investigation. I'll
be in my Ready Room.

Troi and Riker exchange a surprised look.

RIKER
Sir?

PICARD
(hard)
Make it so.

Picard EXITS. An awkward beat. What's wrong with the
Captain? But they have their orders.

As Riker and  Worf head for the EXIT...

CUT TO:

52   INT. OBSERVATORY - OPS CENTER (VFX-P)                       52

The station is a SMOKING RUIN -- consoles flickering,
lights dim, damage everywhere. Only a few minutes have
passed since they were attacked. Riker, Worf, Beverly
and two SECURITY GUARDS MATERIALIZE. They're all back
in uniform, holding phasers and palm beacons. Worf has
a tricorder and Beverly has a medical kit. The room is
cramped, there are fallen bulk-heads and blown-out
consoles. The debris makes it difficult to get a clear
view of the room.

WORF
These blast patterns are
consistent with type-three
disruptors.

RIKER
Well, that narrows it to Klingon,
Breen or Romulan.

Beverly follows her tricorder readings.

BEVERLY
I'm picking up life signs... about
twenty meters ahead.

WORF
That rules out Klingons.

Riker gives him a look.

WORF
They would not have left anyone
alive.

BEVERLY
Over here.

They pick their way carefully through the carnage of
the station...and come to the body of a Starfleet
Science Officer. He has taken a disruptor blast to the
back and there is a nasty-looking scorch mark on his
uniform. Beverly immediately takes some devices out of
her medical kit and begins to treat him.

RIKER
Worf, you're with me. Paskall,
you and Mendez search the upper
deck.

The Security Guards climb a nearby ladder while Riker
and Worf head down a dimly-lit corridor. Riker stops
at two bodies in the hall, checks them over -- but
they're dead. There is a sudden banging from the far
corner of the room. Worf and Riker quickly move to a
collapsed bulkhead.

WORF
Under here...

They both grab hold of a large metal plate, pull it
aside and begin to dig through the debris. Finally, a
HAND can be seen grasping about from within the pile of
rubble. Riker and Worf work faster. Worf grabs the
man's hand.

WORF
It's all right... do not struggle.

Worf holds the man's hand as Riker shoves away a final
console. We reveal the head and torso of Doctor Soran,
one of the survivors from the Lakul (and last seen
in Sickbay aboard the Enterprise-B). Soran has not aged
at all over the years but he does have a permanent
scar on his face from the earlier wound. He blinks a
few times, seems a little dazed.

RIKER
I'm Commander William Riker of the
Starship Enterprise.

SORAN
Soran... Doctor Tolian Soran...

Soran puts a hand to his head, still trying to get his
bearings.

RIKER
Who attacked you, Doctor?

SORAN
I'm not sure... it happened so
fast...

SECURITY OFFICER
(calls out)
Commander -- you'd better take a
look at this.

Riker and Worf move to the ladder as Beverly begins to
scan Soran...

53   NEW ANGLE - UPPER DECK                                      53

Riker and Worf move over to the two Security Guards who
are kneeling over a dead body which is obscured from
view. One guard turns over the body, revealing a
ROMULAN SOLDIER. Worf looks at him in disgust.

WORF
Romulan.

Riker and Worf exchange a look. OFF their reactions...

CUT TO:

54   INT. DATA'S QUARTERS                                        54

Data is sitting in a chair, petting SPOT THE CAT.
Geordi is standing next to him.

DATA
Is she still angry?

GEORDI
No... but I'd stay out of Sickbay
for a while if I were you. I
still don't know why you dropped
her in the water.

DATA
I was attempting to... get in the
spirit of things. I thought it
would be humorous.

Data frowns. troubled by this recent experience. He
puts Spot down and moves to a bulkhead. He activates
a control panel and a small compartment slides OPEN,
revealing a small COMPUTER CHIP  which is suspended in
a glass and metal framework. Data looks at the chip
for a beat and Geordi moves to him in concern.

GEORDI
Data... you're not thinking about
using that thing are you?

DATA
It has occurred to me on several
occasions. But I believe this may
be the appropriate time.

GEORDI
Wait a minute. I thought you've
always been afraid it would
overload your neural net.

DATA
That is true. However, I believe
my growth as an artificial
life form has reached an impasse.
For thirty-four years I have
endeavored to become more "human" -
to grow beyond my original
programming. And yet I am still
unable to grasp such a simple
concept as humor.
(re: chip)
This emotion chip is the only
answer.

Geordi considers a moment, looks at the chip...
and reluctantly has to agree.

GEORDI
All right...

Data sits down and La Forge moves to stand behind him.

GEORDI
But at the first sign of trouble,
I'm going to deactivate it.
agreed?

DATA
Agreed.

Geordi works on Data's head for a moment, and then
OPENS a panel on Data's head, revealing the blinking
circuitry within.

CUT TO:

55   INT. READY ROOM                                             55

Riker is standing next to Picard, who has his back turned
and is staring out the window. Picard seems distracted
during the scene, his mind clearly elsewhere as Riker
finishes his report.

RIKER
We found two dead Romulans aboard
the station. We're analyzing
their equipment to see if we can
determine what ship they came
from.

Picard nods absently.

PICARD
There's still no indication of why
they attacked the station?

RIKER
We think they were looking for
something -- they practically tore
the place apart.

PICARD
Hmm...
(beat)
Inform Starfleet Command. This
could indicate a new Romulan
threat in this sector.

RIKER
You want me to contact Starfleet?

PICARD
Is there a problem?

RIKER
No, sir.

PICARD
Thank you, Number One.

Picard keeps his back turned, looking out the window.
Riker hesitates, awkward.

RIKER
There is something else, Captain.
One of the scientists. a Doctor
Soran... has insisted on speaking
with you.
(beat)
I told him you were busy, sir, but
he said it was absolutely
imperative that he speak with you
right away.

PICARD
Understood. That will be all.

RIKER
Sir... is there anything wrong?

PICARD
No. Thank you.

A beat, then Riker turns and EXITS. Off Picard's
unreadable face...

CUT TO:

56   INT. TEN FORWARD                                            56

The room is bustling with patrons and activity. Data
ENTERS with an odd look on his face...his body
language subtly altered. He is looking at the world
through new eyes. Geordi is following him closely,
watching his every move. They move to the bar. Guinan
comes over -- she has not aged at all since the
Enterprise-B. She sets down an exotic-looking container
full of dark liquid.

GUINAN
You two just volunteered to be my
first victims.
(re: liquid)
This is a new concoction I
picked up on Forcas Three. Trust me,
you're going to love it.

She pours two glasses of the liquid. Data takes one
and sniffs it, then takes a drink. Geordi watches him
closely. Data frowns.

GEORDI
Well...?

DATA
I believe the beverage has
provoked an emotional response.

GEORDI
Really? What do you feel?

DATA
I am uncertain. I have had little
experience with emotions... I am
unable to articulate the
sensation.

GUINAN
Emotions?

GEORDI
I'll explain later...

Data finishes the drink... concentrates, tries to make
sense of the rush of feelings. His expression is one
of disgust.

GUINAN
(to Geordi)
I don't think he likes it.

DATA
(excited)
Yes. That is it. I hate it.

GEORDI
Data, I think the chip is
working...

Data looks at Geordi with a big smile on his face.

DATA
Yes. I hate this! It is
revolting!

Beat.

GUINAN
Another round?

DATA
Please.

In the b.g., we see Picard ENTER Ten Forward.

57   FOLLOW PICARD                                               57

as he walks through Ten Forward and heads toward a
table by the windows. Soran is sitting at the table,
staring out at the stars, lost in thought. His
observatory uniform is distinctive, and sets him apart
from everyone else in the room. Picard walks up to the
table.

PICARD
Doctor Soran...?

SORAN
Yes, yes, Captain -- thank you for
coming.

The men shake hands and Picard sits down. Soran is an
imposing physical presence, but at the moment he seems
very much the eccentric scientists consumed with his
work. Picard waves away a waiter.

PICARD
Nothing for me.
(brusque, to Soran)
I understand there's something
urgent you need to discuss with
me.

SORAN
Yes. I need to return to the
observatory immediately. I must
continue a critical experiment I
was running on the Amargosa star.

Picard's reaction is a little impatient -- this doesn't
sound that imperative to him.

PICARD
Doctor... we're still conducting
an investigation into the attack.
Once we've completed our work,
we'll be happy to allow you and
your fellow scientists back aboard
the observatory. Until then --

SORAN
The timing is very important on my
experiment -- if it is not
completed within the next twelve
hours, years of research will be
lost.

PICARD
We're doing the best we can. Now
if you'll excuse me...

Picard moves to stand, but Soran reaches out and gently
but firmly grabs him by the arm. The unexpected
physical contact and the change of intensity in Soran's
face stops Picard in his tracks.

SORAN
(cryptically)
They say time is the fire in
which we burn... and right now,
Captain, my time is running out.
(beat)
We leave so many things unfinished
in our lives -- I'm sure you can
understand.

For some reason, Soran's words have struck a deep chord
within Picard.

He looks away from Soran's compelling gaze and thinks
for a long moment. When he finally speaks, his voice
is barely above a whisper.

PICARD
I'll see what I can do...

Picard walks away without a word before Soran can
thank him. Soran looks after him with relief, then
pulls out an ANTIQUE POCKET WATCH and opens it. He
looks at the watch for a long moment. then snaps it
closed and head for the opposite exit from the one
Picard took. FOLLOW Soran across Ten Forward...until
he suddenly stops in shock at something he sees...

58   SORAN'S POV                                                 58

of Guinan, who is now back at the bar.

59   RESUME SORAN                                                59

A dark look crosses his face -- he is disturbed by the
sight of Guinan. He quickly turns and EXITS.

60   ON GUINAN                                                   60

she begins to sense something, as though someone is
watching her. She turns, looks in the direction where
Soran was just standing, but there's no one there now.
She shakes off the feeling and goes back to work.

CUT TO:

61   INT. ENGINEERING                                            61

A short time later. A Romulan tricorder is connected
to some diagnostic equipment near a console. Worf is
talking to Riker.

Worf activates a MONITOR which shows a complex diagram
of sensor information.

WORF
One of the dead Romulans had a
tricorder. We analyzed its sensor
logs and found they were scanning
for signature particles of a
compound called trilithium.

RIKER
Trilithium?

WORF
An experimental compound the
Romulans have been working on. In
theory, a trilithium-based
explosive would be thousands of
times more powerful than an
anti-matter weapon. But they never
found a way to stabilize it.

RIKER
Why were they looking for it on a
Federation observatory? It doesn't
make any sense.

Riker considers.

RIKER
(cont'd)
Have Geordi and Data go over with
the next Away Team...  tell them to
scan the observatory for
trilithium.

WORF
Aye, sir.

CUT TO:

62   INT. OBSERVATORY OPS                                        62

The station is still a wreck. Geordi and Data are
scanning the room with tricorders.

GEORDI
(off tricorder)
There's no sign of any trilithium
in here.

Geordi continues to scan... then suddenly Data lets out
a quiet GIGGLE. Geordi stops and turns to look at him.
Data giggles louder.

DATA
(laughing, to himself)
I get it. I get it.

GEORDI
You get what?

Data laughs again.

DATA
When you said to Commander
Riker...
(imitating Geordi's voice)
"The clown can stay, but the
Ferengi in the gorilla suit has to
go."

Geordi looks blankly at him for a moment.

GEORDI
What?

DATA
During the Farpoint mission. We
were on the Bridge and you told a
joke. That was the punch line.

GEORDI
The Farpoint mission? Data, that
was seven years ago.

DATA
I know. I just got it.
(laughs)
It was very funny.

GEORDI
Thanks.

Geordi indicates a corridor. They EXIT in that
direction...

63   INT. OBSERVATORY CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                      63

A short corridor connecting the Ops Center with other
compartments. Geordi suddenly stops in front of what
appears to be a standard bulkhead.

GEORDI
Wait a minute... there's a hidden
doorway here. I can see the
joint of the metal with my VISOR.

Geordi runs his finger in a vertical line along what
appears to be a smooth bulkhead.

DATA
(off tricorder)
There appears to be a dampening
field in operation. I cannot scan
beyond the bulkhead.

Geordi puts his tricorder away and begins looking for
a way to open the door.

GEORDI
I don't see a control panel...or
an access port.

DATA
(off tricorder)
It appears to be a magnetically
sealed.

Data steps forward and OPENS a small panel on wrist
and makes a quick adjustment to the circuitry within.

DATA
I believe I can reverse the
polarity by attenuating my axial
servo.

Data completes his adjustment and then moves his wrist
over the door panel.

DATA
(joking)
"Open sesame."

There is a HUMMING sound followed by a loud CLICK. The
door slides open.

DATA
(smiles)
You could say I have a... magnetic
personality.

Geordi reacts to the bad pun with a grimace. They EXIT
to.

64   INT. OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                    64

A small room with several probes stacked in holding
racks. Geordi and Data scan.

GEORDI
I'm still not picking up anything.
Someone went to a lot of trouble
to shield this room.

They put their tricorders away and begin looking around
the room. Data continues to snicker and giggle as he
tries not to laugh at jokes his mind conjures up.
Geordi begins inspecting the probes... finally stops
at one probe which has SEVERAL ODD DEVICES attached to
the side.

GEORDI
Data, take a look at this.
(Data comes over)
You ever seen a solar probe with
this kind of configuration?

Data uses the tricorder as if it were a puppet as he
opens and closes it like a mouth.

DATA
(making tricorder "talk")
No, Geordi. I have not. It is
most unusual.

Data giggles and Geordi reacts with the irritation of
someone listening to a very bad comedian.

GEORDI
Just help me get this panel open.

Data helps Geordi as they try to open a panel on the
casing of the probe. They open the panel and Geordi
looks inside.he reacts to something.

GEORDI
Whoa. my VISOR'S picking up
something in the theta band...it
could be a trilithium signature.

Data suddenly start LAUGHING. Geordi turns in
irritation.

GEORDI
Data, this isn't the time...

DATA
(laughing)
I am sorry... but I cannot stop
myself... I think something is
wrong...

64A   ANGLE (VFX-P)                                              64A

Data's laughter escalates into hysteria... then Data
begins to JERK and SHAKE and goes into a bizarre
"emotional seizure." A rush of EMOTIONS race across
his face. anger, passion, shock... a kaleidoscopic
blur of reactions contort his features. Then it stops
and he FALLS to the ground.

GEORDI
Data!

Geordi rushes to him. Data has a look of surprise on
his face as he blinks a few times. He sits up.

GEORDI
Data, are you all right?

DATA
I believe the emotional chip has
overloaded my positronic relays.

GEORDI
We better get you back to the
Ship.
(hits combadge)
La Forge to Enterprise.

There's no response. Geordi frowns for a beat, then we
hear Soran's voice.

SORAN
Is there a problem, gentlemen?

65   INCLUDE SORAN                                               65

standing in the room. Geordi didn't hear him come in.

GEORDI
Oh... Doctor... yeah, as a matter
of fact, there is. There's a
damping field in here blocking
our com signal.
(re: Data)
Will you give me a hand?

Over the above dialogue, Soran glances over at the
solar probe Geordi was inspecting. He notes the opened
panel and a disturbed look crosses his face.

Soran looks back at Geordi.

SORAN
I'd be happy to.

Soran moves toward them. and then without warning, he
punches Geordi in the face, KNOCKING the VISOR across
the room. He whirls around and points a phaser at
Data, who suddenly looks fearful.

DATA
Please don't hurt me.

CUT TO:

66   INT. PICARD'S QUARTERS                                      66

Picard is standing at the replicator.

PICARD
Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.

The cup of tea APPEARS in the replicator and at the
same moment, the door CHIMES.

PICARD
Come.

Troi ENTERS. Picard would rather not be bothered right
now, but he is polite as always.

PICARD
Counselor. What can I do for you?

TROI
Actually... I'm here to see if
there's anything I can do for you.

PICARD
Well... I appreciate your concern,
but I'd rather not discuss it
right now, thank you.

But Troi won't be brushed away so easily.

TROI
I'm afraid I can't just leave it
at that. The commanding officer
of this ship is clearly distraught
about something. As ship's
Counselor, it's my duty to --

PICARD
As ship's counselor, it's your
duty to know not only when you're
needed... but also when you're
not.

TROI
You can't fool an empath, Captain.
I know exactly when I'm needed.

Picard is really not in the mood for this. His tone
hardens.

PICARD
Well, with all due respect to your
Betazoid senses, I prefer to be
alone right now.

TROI
Very well. I suppose I could make
out my weekly report to Starfleet
Command without your input.
(beat)
"Admiral Lusby... regarding the
unusual behavior of Jean-Luc
Picard: I find him increasingly
Irritable... remote... and
uncooperative. I recommend forced
shore leave at a Starbase facility
in order to --"

PICARD
All right, all right. You've made
your point.

Troi takes a seat and patiently waits. Picard gets
up.moves around the room for a moment...and stops.
He speaks in a flat, unemotional tone of voice.

PICARD
The message I received...
(beat)
My brother... and his son -- my
nephew -- burned to death in a
fire.

Troi reacts, genuinely surprised.

TROI
Captain, I'm sorry.
(beat)
I know there were a lot of
unresolved conflicts between you
and your brother.

PICARD
What I can't get out of my mind is
the image of Rene -- my nephew.
I just can't believe he's gone...

He trails off.

TROI
It's only natural to feel a
heightened sense of tragedy when
a child dies...
(sensing more)
But it goes deeper than that,
doesn't it? I can sense that Rene
meant a great deal to you.

PICARD
In a way, he was as close as I
ever came to having a child of my
own.

Troi eyes an open photo album on the table. She reaches
over and flips through the pages for a moment. There
are many photos inside... from many periods in time
including one of Picard's brother standing next to his
young son. This is the Picard family album.

TROI
Your family history is very
important to you, isn't it?

PICARD
(nods)
Ever since I was a little boy, I
remember hearing about the family
line. The Picards that fought at
Trafalgar... the Picard's that
settled the first Martian colony.
When my brother married and had a
son...

Picard hesitates -- this is difficult for him.

TROI
... You felt it was no longer your
responsibility to carry on the
family line.

PICARD
(nods)
My brother had shouldered that
burden... allowing me to pursue my
own selfish needs...

TROI
There's nothing selfish about
pursuing your own life... your own
career.

Picard moves to the window, stares outside. A shadow
crosses his face. He's getting to the heart of the
matter.

PICARD
You know, Counselor... I'm not
getting any younger. For some
time now, I've been aware that
there are fewer days ahead than
there are behind...
(beat)
But I always took comfort in the
fact that when I was gone, my
family would continue. But now...

Picard moves back to the photo album, open it to the
last page, an then flips through the remaining pages --
they are blank.

PICARD
I've had brushes with death...
more than I care to contemplate.
I always accepted it as a
calculated risk that goes along
with wearing this uniform.
(beat)
But now... the idea of death has
a terrible sense of finality to
it.

He looks at her.

PICARD
I'm the last Picard.

A quiet beat as Troi considers him.

TROI
Captain, perhaps we --

Suddenly, a BLINDING BURST OF LIGHT  from outside the
windows washes into the room. Troi and Picard rush to
the window and shield their eyes against the glare.

Picard and Troi ENTER from a turbolift. Riker and Worf
at their stations. The star is on the Viewscreen,
getting DARKER by the second... more flaming debris
is being ejected into space.

PICARD
Report.

RIKER
A quantum implosion has occurred
within the Amargosa star. All
nuclear fusion is breaking down.

PICARD
How is that possible?

WORF
Sensor records show a solar probe
was launched from the observatory
a few moments ago.

RIKER
The star's going to collapse in a
matter of minutes.

Something beeps on Worf's console.

WORF
Sir, the implosion has produced
a level twelve shock wave.

TROI
(shocked)
Level twelve? That'll destroy
everything in this system.

TRANSPORTER COM VOICE
Transporter room to Bridge. I
can't locate Commander La Forge or
Mister Data, sir.

RIKER
(to Worf)
Did they return to the ship?

WORF
(works)
No, sir. They are not aboard.

PICARD
How long until the shock wave hits
the observatory?

WORF
Four minutes, forty seconds.

Picard looks at Riker, who then quickly heads for the
turbolift.

RIKER
Mister Worf.

Riker and Worf EXIT.

70   EXT. SPACE- THE STAR (VFX-I)                                70

The star is almost entirely dark. Radiating out from the
star is a huge shock wave- a rapidly growing sphere of
energy.

71   INT. OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM (VFX-P)                         71

Soran is standing at a console watching a graphic
depiction of the star's collapse on a monitor when the
door suddenly opens. Soran whirls around and FIRES his
phaser at Riker and Worf. They dive for cover just
outside the room. (NOTE: The probe Geordi examined
earlier is now gone.)

RIKER
(to Worf)
What the hell's he doing?

Worf dodges another phaser blast and sees Geordi lying
unconscious on the deck. Data is nowhere to be seen.

PICARD'S COM VOICE
Enterprise to Commander Riker, you
have two minutes left.

RIKER
(yells to Soran)
Soran, did you hear that? There's
a level twelve shock wave coming.
We've got to get out of here!

Soran's only answer is another phaser blast.

Sir. A Klingon Bird of Prey is

Shocked reactions.

RIKER
Data! See if you can get to

Data looks up at him with a terrified look on his face.

DATA
I... cannot, sir. I believe I
Am... afraid.

Suddenly Soran's communicator BEEPS. Soran reaches
down and grabs the unconscious Geordi by the collar and
the two of them DEMATERIALIZE. (Soran has the VISOR in
his hand.) Riker, Data and Worf react.

On a monitor where we can see a graphic depiction of
the darkening star and shock wave. MOVE TO REVEAL

We are the inside an old Klingon ship - it's beaten up and
patched in several places, obviously not a first-line
model. Watching the Viewscreen are LURSA and B'ETOR,
two powerful-looking Klingon women... They are sisters.
aggressive... seductive... and very dangerous. Several N.D.
male Klingons man the various stations.

The sisters stare at the image of the destroyed sun in
awe.

B'ETOR
Toh-pak-cha...
(Glorious...)

LURSA
HoS qorDu...
(A great power...)

Soran now ENTERS the Bridge. His expression is dark
and angry. He is clearly not a prisoner here and he
strides up to the sisters.

B'ETOR
(excited, to Soran)
You've done it, Soran.

But without warning, Soran HITS B'Etor squarely in the
jaw, knocking her back over a console. Several
Klingons leap to their feet, drawing their weapons...
but B'Etor holds up a hand as she gets to one knee.

B'ETOR
Wait!

She dabs a trickle of blood at the corner of her
mouth... her expression is angry and threatening.

B'ETOR
I hope for your sake that you are
initiating a mating ritual.

SORAN
You got careless. The Romulans
came looking for their missing
trilithium.

B'ETOR
Impossible. We left no survivors
on their outpost.

B'Etor has now gotten to her feet in the b.g.

SORAN
They knew it was aboard the
observatory. If the Enterprise
hadn't intervened, they would have
found it.

LURSA
But they didn't find it... and now
we have a weapon of unlimited
power.

SORAN
I have the weapon, Lursa. And if
you ever want me to give it to
you, I advise you to be a little
more careful in the future.

B'Etor grabs Soran and holds a wicked-looking knife to
his throat.

B'ETOR
Perhaps we are tired of waiting.

Soran is unfazed by this threat.

SORAN
Without my research... the
trilithium is worthless... as are
your plans to reconquer the
Klingon Empire.

Lursa reaches out and calmly pushes her sister's knife
away.

SORAN
Set course for the Veridian
system. Maximum warp.

LURSA
(to Helm)
Bosh-ta-JaH Veridian
(Set course for Veridian)

A KLINGON GUARD ENTERS dragging the unconscious Geordi.

KLINGON GUARD
What shall I do with this?

Soran moves toward Geordi, a grim look on his face.

SORAN
Bring him with me. I need some
answers from Mr. La Forge.

Soran EXITS.

Riker and Worf are on the move down the corridor.

WORF
I have spoken to the Klingon High
Council, sir. They identified the
Bird of Prey as belonging to the
Duras sisters.

RIKER
(surprised)
Lursa and B'Etor...? This doesn't
make any sense. A renowned
stellar physicist somehow uses a
trilithium probe to destroy a
star, kidnaps Geordi... and
escapes with a pair of Klingon
renegades... Why? What the hell's
going on?

They EXIT to...

Worf and Riker ENTER. Beverly is closing a panel on
the back of Data's head. He is sitting on a bio-bed,
scanning himself with a tricorder.

RIKER
How is he?

BEVERLY
It looks like a power surge fused
the emotional chip into his neural
net.

WORF
Will that be a danger to him?

BEVERLY
I don't think so. The chip still
seems to be working. I'd feel
better if I could take a closer
look, but I can't remove it
without completely dismantling his
cerebral conduit.

RIKER
(to Data)
Looks like you're stuck with
emotions for a while. How do you
feel?

DATA
I am quite... preoccupied with
concern about Geordi.

RIKER
We all are, Data. But we're going
to get him back.

DATA
I hope so, sir.

Data's expression is still one of concern. Beverly
pulls Riker aside.

BEVERLY
Wil, I checked into Doctor Soran's
background.

Beverly activates the wall monitor and a picture of
Doctor Soran along with some biographical information
appears.

BEVERLY
He's an El-Aurian... over three
hundred years old. He lost his
entire family when the Borg
destroyed his world. Soran
escaped with a handful of other
refugees aboard a ship called the
Lakul. The ship was destroyed by
some kind of energy ribbon, but
Soran and forty-six others were
rescued by the Enterprise-B.

RIKER
(reacts)
That was the mission where James
Kirk was killed.

BEVERLY
I checked the passenger manifest
of the Lakul... guess who else was
on board?

She hits a control and suddenly Guinan's face appears
on the screen. Riker reacts to the image...

CUT TO:

82   INT. GUINAN'S QUARTERS                                      82

Close on Guinan as she looks up, surprised.

GUINAN
Soran? That's a name I haven't
heard in a long time.

MOVE TO REVEAL Guinan's Quarters, which are unlike any
of the others on the Enterprise. None of the standard
furniture, consoles or decoration are present. The
floor is made of tile, not carpet... the walls are
draped in exotic fabric. The lighting is moody and
subdued.

Picard is standing before Guinan, who is sitting cross-
legged on the floor. They talk to each other with an
easy familiarity... two old friends who know each
other well.

PICARD
Do you remember him?

GUINAN
Oh yes. I remember everyone who
was on the Lakul... every face.
even the ones who didn't make
it...

Guinan stands and begins to move about the room...
she's clearly troubled by the memories. She hesitates,
looks off into the middle-distance for a few moments.
Picard moves to her.

PICARD
Guinan. It's important that you
tell me what you know. We think
Soran's developed a weapon... a
terrible weapon. It might give
him enough power to --

GUINAN
Soran doesn't care about power or
weapons. All he cares about is
getting back to the Nexus.

PICARD
What's the "Nexus"?

Guinan moves to a table and begins to shift around some
exotic-looking alien artifacts... distracting
herself... this is difficult for her to discuss.

GUINAN
It's a place I've tried very hard
to forget...

She makes the decision to plunge ahead.

GUINAN
That ribbon isn't just some random
energy phenomenon traveling
through space... it's a doorway.
It leads to another place... the
Nexus. It doesn't exist in our
Universe... and it doesn't play by
the same rules either.

PICARD
What happened to you?

GUINAN
I can't remember very much... what
it looked like or how long I was
there... but I do remember how it
felt...

She turns to him and her face is filled with some kind
of awe at the memory.

GUINAN
It was like being inside... joy.
As if joy was a real thing that I
could wrap around myself. I've
never been so content...

A long beat as Picard absorbs her words.

PICARD
But then you were beamed away...

Guinan shows a rare burst of anger.

GUINAN
I was pulled away. I didn't want
to leave; none of us did. I felt
like I'd left a part of myself
behind. All I could think about
was getting back... I didn't care
what I had to do.

Guinan moves to a window and looks out at the stars.

GUINAN
It took a long time, but
eventually I learned to live with
it. And I began to realize that
my experience in the Nexus had
changed me...
(beat)
I knew things about people...
about events...about time...

PICARD
Your "sixth sense"... I've always
wondered where it came from...
(beat)
And what about Soran?

GUINAN
Soran may still be obsessed with
getting back. And if he is, he'll
do anything to find that doorway
again.

PICARD
But why destroy a star...?
(beat)
Thank you, Guinan.

He heads for the door.

GUINAN
Let someone else do it, Jean-Luc.

Picard stops, looks at her.

GUINAN
Let them send another starship.
Don't get near the ribbon. If you
go into that Nexus, you're not
going to care about Soran or the
Enterprise or me. All you're
going to care about is how it
feels to be there.
(beat)
And you're never going to come
back.

Picard weighs her words... sees the warning in her
eyes... and carefully backs away and EXITS.

CUT TO:

83   INT. KLINGON BIRD OF PREY - QUARTERS (VFX-P)                83

A dimly-lit room somewhere in the bowels of the Klingon
ship. Like every other room on this decrepit ship, the
room looks well-worn and ill-maintained. Soran is
seated behind a table, holding the VISOR. A PADD and
Soran's pocket watch sit on the table. Geordi is
sitting in a chair across from him -- his shirt has
been removed. He looks very tense.

SORAN
(re: VISOR)
A remarkable piece of equipment...
but a little inelegant, wouldn't
you say?
(beat)
Have you ever considered a
prosthesis that would make you
look a little more... normal?

GEORDI
What's normal?

SORAN
Normal is what everyone else is...
and what you are not.

GEORDI
What do you want?

Soran takes a moment.

SORAN
As you may or may not be aware, I
am an El-Aurian. Some people call
us a race of "listeners". We
listen.
(beat)
Right now, Mr. La Forge, you
have my undivided attention. I
want to listen to everything you
know about trilithium. and me.

Geordi thinks.

GEORDI
Trilithium is an experimental
compound developed by the
Romulans. I think it's a
derivative of --

Soran picks up the PADD from the desk and activates it.
Suddenly something small, with sharp edges, can be
seen MOVING just underneath Geordi's skin near his
chest. Geordi moves his hand to the spot, but then the
protrusion is suddenly gone.

SORAN
I don't want a science lecture.
You were on that observatory
looking for trilithium... why?

GEORDI
I was ordered to by the Captain.

On the PADD in Soran's hand, we can now see an interior
graphic of Geordi's body sitting in the chair. The
graphic is interactive, moving as Geordi moves.
A BLINKING DOT represents the movement of the probe
inside his body. Right now, the dot is in the middle
of his chest.

SORAN
Let's try to move beyond the usual
prisoner-interrogator banter,
shall we? You have information,
and I need it.
(beat)
Did the Captain explain his orders
to you? Did he say why you were
searching for trilithium?

GEORDI
No.

SORAN
What about... Guinan? What has
she told you about me?

GEORDI
Guinan? I don't know what you're
talking about...

On the PADD, we now see the dot has moved to a position
next to Geordi's heart. Soran looks up at Geordi.

SORAN
My instincts tell me you're lying.
And I know that can't be easy for
you...
(off PADD)
I can see you have a good heart.

Soran taps a control on the PADD. Suddenly Geordi
grabs his chest in pain. Soran watches Geordi for a
few seconds, then taps the PADD again. Geordi gasps
and starts to breathe.

SORAN
Oh... I forgot to tell you. While
you were unconscious, I injected
a nano-probe into your
bloodstream. It's been navigating
your cardiovascular system... and
right now I've attached it to your
left ventricle.
(smiles)
A little trick I picked up
from the Borg.

GEORDI
(gasping)
Yeah... they're full of great
ideas.

SORAN
I just stopped your heart for five
seconds. It felt like an
eternity, didn't it? Did you know
that you can stop the human heart
for up to ten minutes before the
onset of brain damage?

GEORDI
No... I didn't know that...

SORAN
We learn something new about
ourselves every day.
(beat)
Now. Maybe I didn't make myself
clear. It is very important that
you tell me exactly what Captain
Picard knows.

GEORDI
I told you everything... you might
as well just kill me right now...

Soran's features soften as he smiles slightly. For a
moment, he looks genuinely compassionate -- and it's
a disturbing contrast to his usual dark intensity.

SORAN
I'm not a killer, Mr. La Forge.
(beat)
Let's try thirty seconds.

Soran taps a control on the PADD. Geordi gasps and
strains against an unimaginable pain.

Soran picks up his pocket watch and opens the cover...
sits back in his chair, watching the seconds tick
away...

CUT TO:

84   INT. STELLAR CARTOGRAPHY (VFX-P)                            84

A room filled with exotic-looking devices, sensors and
computers which handle the enormous task of tracking
the ship's position in space.

The monitors around the room display various diagrams
of the ENERGY RIBBON (as seen in the beginning of the
film).

Data is sitting at a computer console which has a great
deal of complex information on the screen. Picard is
standing next to him. Throughout the following, Data
seems distracted and preoccupied.

DATA
According to our information, the
ribbon is a conflux of temporal
energy which travels through our
galaxy every thirty-nine point one
years

PICARD
When is it expected back?

Data doesn't answer right away.

PICARD
Data?

DATA
Sorry, Captain. The Ribbon has
already entered the galaxy. It
will pass through this sector in
approximately thirty-one hours.

Picard moves about the room... he's frustrated...
tired... but determined to find out what's going on.

PICARD
Guinan said Soran was trying to
get back to the ribbon... if
that's true, then there must be
some connection with the Amargosa
star.

DATA
The star's destruction has had
numerous astro-physical effects
within this sector. However, none
of them appear to have a
connection to the energy ribbon.

PICARD
Give me a list of those effects.
I want to know every single thing
which has been altered or
changed... no matter how
insignificant...

DATA
It will take a few moments for the
computer to compile the
information.

Data works the computer and then the computer begins to
work. Data sighs -- his expression becomes downcast
and gloomy. He sits down and puts his head in his
hands. Picard finally has to say something.

PICARD
Data, are you all right?

DATA
No, sir. I am finding it
difficult to concentrate... I
believe I am overwhelmed with
feelings of... remorse and regret
concerning my actions on the
observatory.

PICARD
What do you mean?

DATA
I wanted to save Geordi... I
tried. but I experienced
something I did not expect.
(beat)
I believe it was fear.

Picard regards him sympathetically.

PICARD
Fear is a very difficult emotion
to overcome. It's something we
all have to learn to deal with.

DATA
But I did not deal with it, sir.
I let it prevent me from helping
my friend.
(beat)
Does that make me a coward?

PICARD
No. And what you must try to
avoid is becoming consumed by
another emotion which I believe
you're beginning to experience...
guilt.

DATA
(considers)
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant
feeling.

84A   ANGLE (VFX-P)                                              84A

The computer finishes its calculations and the console
BEEPS. Data works the console. Information appears on
screen.

DATA
According to our current
information, the destruction of
the Amargosa star has had the
following effects in this sector:
gamma emissions have increased by
five percent... the starship
Bozeman was forced to make a
course correction... a research
project on Gorik Four was
halted due to increased neutrino
particles... ambient magnetic
fields have decreased by --

PICARD
Wait. The Bozeman... why did it
change course?

DATA
(matter of fact)
The destruction of the Amargosa
star has altered the gravitational
forces throughout the sector. Any
ship passing through this region
will have to make a minor course
correction.

Picard is starting to get an idea... he's onto
something here. He moves to a large table in the
center of the room.

PICARD
(musing)
A minor course correction...
(beat)
Where is the ribbon now?

84B    ANGLE (VFX-P)                                              84B

Data moves to the table to work. after a few beats,
an elaborate map of the galaxy springs up on the
ceiling of the room. A BLINKING DOT shows the position
of the ribbon.

DATA
This is its current position.

PICARD
Can you project its course?

Data hesitates... still obsessed with his own emotional
turmoil. Picard finally has to lay down the law.

PICARD
(firm)
Data. I have nothing but sympathy
for what you're going through.
But right now, I need your full
attention on the task at hand.
If you can't provide it... then I'll
have to relieve you of duty until
Doctor Crusher can remove this.
emotion chip of yours. I'm sorry,
but you leave me no other choice.

This snaps Data back... he considers this for a long
moment, then looks  determined.

DATA
I do not wish to remove the chip,
sir. Although these emotions are
proving difficult to deal with...
I cannot imagine going back to a
life without them. I have taken
an important step toward becoming
truly human. If I were to turn
back now...
(beat)
I would like to continue in my
duties, sir.

Picard smiles at him.

PICARD
Courage is an emotion too, Data.
(beat)
Now... can you project the course
of the ribbon?

DATA
I believe so.

84C   ANGLE (VFX-P)                                              84C

Data works the console. A RED LINE moves to form an
arc through the star field. Picard examines the display
for a moment and nods... he's excited, on to
something...

PICARD
Enhance grid A-nine.

Data works and the display now ZOOMS into a single
SECTOR. The RED LINE cuts through the sector.

PICARD
Where was the Amargosa star?

Data works. A STAR is highlighted near the red line.

PICARD
Now... you said the gravitational
forces in this sector have been
altered... could that also affect
the course of the ribbon?

DATA
(thinks)
I believe so.

84D   ANGLE (VFX-P)                                              84D

Data works and holographic display CHANGES again.
The red line representing the course of the ribbon now
shifts to the right -- AWAY from the Amargosa star's
position. Picard is beginning to realize what's going on.

PICARD
That's what Soran's doing... he's
changing its course.
(beat)
But why? Why try to alter its
path... why not simply fly into it
with a ship?

Data thinks for a moment.

DATA
Our records show that every ship
which has approached the ribbon
has either been destroyed or
severely damaged.

Picard thinks about this... then has a flash of
insight.

PICARD
He can't go to the ribbon... so
he's trying to make the ribbon
come to him.
(beat)
Data, is it going to pass near any
M-Class planets?

DATA
(works)
Yes, sir. There are two in the
Veridian system.

84E   ANGLE (VFX-P)                                              84E

The display ZOOMS IN on a star very close to the
ribbon's path. We now see a SOLAR SYSTEM with a single
star and FOUR PLANETS. The RED LINE moves directly
through the system -- it passes very close to the third
planet. Picard eyes that planet and points to it.

PICARD
It's very close to Veridian
Three... but not close enough...

Picard's mind is going a mile a minute. He suddenly
has a horrible realization.

PICARD
Data, what would happen to the
ribbon's path if he destroyed the
Veridian star itself?

84F   ANGLE (VFX-P)                                              84F

Data works. On the display, the Veridian star suddenly
DARKENS and GOES OUT. The RED LINE shifts slightly
until it makes an exact INTERSECTION WITH THE THIRD
PLANET. They both react to this sight. they're both
aware of just how serious this is.

PICARD
That's where he's going.

DATA
It should be noted, sir, that the
collapse of the Veridian star
would produce a shock wave similar
to the one we observed at
Amargosa.

PICARD
(grim)
And destroy every planet in the
system.

Picard eyes the graphic with a sense of dread.

PICARD
Are any of them inhabited?

DATA
Veridian Three is uninhabited.
but Veridian Four supports a pre-
industrial humanoid society.

PICARD
Population?

DATA
Approximately two hundred thirty
million.

A grim beat.

Picard is pacing. Riker, Data, Worf, Troi, N.D.s at
their stations. The ship is at Red Alert. Data's mood
has improved. He's making an effort to keep a positive
outlook... to stay upbeat.

RIKER
Maybe they're not out there.

PICARD
They're just trying to decide
whether a twenty year-old Klingon
Bird of Prey is any match for the
Federation flagship.

TROI
Or perhaps they're on the
surface...

PICARD
Mister Data, scan the planet for
life forms.

Data smiles, delighted at the request.

DATA
I was hoping you would ask me to
do that, Captain. I just love to
scan for life forms.

As Data works, he breaks into a merry little song.

DATA
(sings)
"Life forms... tiny little
life forms... where are the
life forms --"

PICARD
Commander.

DATA
Sorry, sir.
(works)
There is too much interference in
the planet's ionosphere for an
accurate reading.

Worf turns to Picard.

WORF
Sir, according to my calculations,
a solar probe launched from either
the Klingon ship or the planet's
surface will take eleven seconds
to reach the star.
(beat)
However, since we do not know the
exact point of origin, it will
take us between eight and fifteen
seconds to lock our weapons onto
it.

They exchange a grim look.

RIKER
(quiet, to Picard)
That's a pretty big margin of
error.

PICARD
Too big. How long until the
ribbon arrives?

DATA
Approximately forty-seven minutes,
sir.

PICARD
(disturbed)
I have to find a way to get to
Soran...

An alarm goes off on Worf's console.

WORF
Captain, Klingon vessel decloaking
directly ahead.

88A   ANGLE (VFX-I)                                              88A

On the view screen, the Bird of Prey decloaks.

WORF
They are hailing.

PICARD
On screen.

88B   ANGLE (VFX-P)                                              88B

On the view screen, Lursa and B'Etor APPEAR.

LURSA
Captain. What an unexpected
pleasure.

PICARD
Lursa, I want to talk to Soran.

LURSA
I'm afraid the Doctor is no longer
aboard our ship.

PICARD
Then I'll beam down to his
location. Just give us his
coordinates.

B'ETOR
The Doctor values his privacy. He
would be quite... upset if an
Away Team interrupted him.

PICARD
Very well... I'll beam to your
ship and you can transport me to
Soran...

RIKER
(urgent)
Sir, you can't trust them.
They'll kill you just like they
Killed Geordi.

Lursa and B'Etor exchange a glance.

LURSA
(innocent)
We did not kill your Engineer.
He's been... our guest.

RIKER
Then return him.

B'ETOR
In exchange for what?

PICARD
Me... If you let me speak to
Soran.

The two sisters appear to consider this for a moment.

B'ETOR
(to Lursa)
The Captain would make a much more
valuable hostage.

LURSA
(to Picard)
We'll consider it a prisoner
exchange.

PICARD
Agreed.

The transmission ENDS. Picard heads for the Turbolift.

PICARD
Number One, you have the Bridge.
Have Doctor Crusher meet me in
Transporter Room Three.

As Picard EXITS...

89   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (VFX-P)                               89

Picard stands on the platform. Crusher and NURSE OGAWA
stand nearby. The TRANSPORTER CHIEF works his console.

CHIEF
Receiving the coordinates, Captain.

PICARD
Energize.

Picard DEMATERIALIZES -- and at the same instant,
Geordi MATERIALIZES. Beverly and Ogawa rush to his
aide, pull out their tricorders and scan him. Geordi
is conscious, and he's wearing his VISOR.

A large plateau ringed with trees and underbrush. A
single ROCK FACE juts upward, forming a backdrop for the
plateau. Against the rock face, a large SCAFFOLDING has
been erected -- planks and beams forming a complex
structure -- ladders connect each level. It leads to
a narrow ledge a dozen meters above.

Picard MATERIALIZES on the plateau. (NOTE: Picard's
combadge is gone and he is unarmed.) A moment as he
looks around. strange animals and birds can be heard.

He turns and sees Soran standing nearby, calmly looking
at his pocket watch. Soran puts the watch away.

SORAN
You must think I'm quite the
madman.

PICARD
The thought had crossed my mind...

SORAN
The only possible reason you're
here is because you're not
entirely confident you can shoot
down my probe after all. So
you've come to dissuade me from
my horrific plan.
(beat)
Good luck.

Soran turns his back on Picard and walks away.

90A   ANGLE (VFX-P)                                              90A

Picard takes a step to follow him and then is JOLTED
backward by a large FORCEFIELD which briefly flashes
into view. The field completely surrounds the plateau,
enclosing Soran and the scaffolding, with Picard on the
outside. OFF Picard's surprise...

CUT TO:

91   INT. KLINGON BIRD OF PREY- BRIDGE (VFX-P)                   91

The Klingon Navigator is working his console.

KLINGON HELM
I have established the link.

LURSA
Put it through over here.

Lursa and B'Etor move to one of the consoles with a
large monitor. The screen shows STATIC for a few
seconds, then clears to a distorted view of a CEILING
on the ENTERPRISE -- this is GEORDI'S POV. (NOTE: The
POV is slightly fritzed, but free of the usual VISOR
effects.)

LURSA
It's working...

B'ETOR
Where is he?

Suddenly, Crusher's face looms large in the picture, as
if she's leaning over Geordi. She smiles and starts
talking. We can see her lips move, but we can't hear
what she's saying.

BEVERLY
(silent)
Don't worry, there's been no
permanent damage. Your heart is
perfectly fine. There's been a
little arterial damage...

Lursa and B'Etor pull back in surprise at the image.

B'ETOR
Human females are so repulsive.

mid-conversation.

BEVERLY

you're going to be fine.

GEORDI
Thanks, Doc.

CUT TO:

93   EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY                                      93

Picard is walking the perimeter of the invisible
forcefield, looking for some way in. Soran is
concentrating on his PADD as Picard tries to engage him
on some level.

PICARD
You don't need to do this,
Soran... I'm sure we could find
another way to get you into this
Nexus.

93A   ANGLE (VFX-P)                                              93A

Soran gets up and works his control PADD. Suddenly a
probe LAUNCHER DECLOAKS  in the middle of the plateau.
The launcher is a cylindrical apparatus the size of a
small car.

Soran goes to the launcher, steps onto it and begins
working the control panel.

SORAN
(calm, distracted)
I've spent eighty years looking
for another way, Captain. This is
the only one.
(beat)
Of course, you could always come
with me. You fancy yourself an
explorer. Here's a chance to
explore something no human has
ever experienced.

PICARD
Not if it means killing over two
hundred million people.
(beat, then with
meaning)
I wonder... did your wife Leandra
know that she married a man who
was capable of mass murder?

This has touched a nerve in Soran... something dark
and ugly flickers across his face.

PICARD
(continuing; pressing on)
When you tucked your children into
bed... do you suppose they ever
suspected that their father would
one day kill millions as casually
as he kissed them goodnight?

Soran looks up at Picard... and for a moment we can see
that Picard has really gotten to him here... then he
finally smiles a smile that doesn't quite reach his
eyes.

SORAN
Nice try.

Lursa and B'Etor are still watching La Forge's POV on the
monitor. They are bored and irritable.

B'ETOR
I thought he was the Chief
Engineer.

LURSA
He is.

B'ETOR
Then when is he going to
Engineering?

The POV shows Geordi's view as he stops in front of
a mirror... wipes away the steam and reveals his own
reflection. Lursa and B'Etor gnash their teeth in
frustration...

CUT TO:

96   EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY                                      96

Soran is working intently on the Launcher's Control
Panel. Picard is still walking the perimeter of the
Forcefield. he's also still trying to engage Soran,
find some way to get to him.

PICARD
What you're about to do is no
different from when the Borg
destroyed your world.

Soran continues to work... keeps his voice calm and
conversational.

SORAN
You're right. And there was a
time when I wouldn't have hurt
anyone. Then the Borg came... and
they showed me that if there is
one constant in this universe,
it's death.
(beat)
Afterwards, I began to realize
that none of it mattered. We're
all going to die anyway. It's
only a question of how and when.
You will too, Captain. You might
contract a fatal disease... you
might die in battle...

Soran now turns and fixes Picard with a penetrating
look.

SORAN
... or burn to death in a fire.

Picard freezes at this. Soran steps off the launcher
with a confident look... he moves closer to where
Picard is standing.

SORAN
You looked surprised. But you
shouldn't be. I've been to the
Nexus, Captain. I know things
about people.
(beat)
Aren't you beginning to feel time
gaining on you? It's like a
predator. It's stalking you. You
can try to outrun it with
doctors... medicines.new
technologies... but in the end,
time is going to hunt you down...
and make the kill.

This strikes home with Picard's own recent concerns...
he struggles for a moment.

PICARD
We're all. mortal, Soran. It's
one of the truths of our
existence.

SORAN
What if I told you I found a new
truth...

PICARD
The Nexus.

SORAN
Time has no meaning there. The
predator has no teeth.

Soran glances up at the sky expectantly, then turns
away from Picard and goes back to work on the Launcher.
OFF Picard's disturbed expression...

97   INT. KLINGON BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE (VFX-P)                  97

B'Etor watching the monitor, impatient. The POV shows
Geordi's view of walking down a CORRIDOR. Lursa walks
over to join her.

LURSA
Where is he now?

B'ETOR
I don't know... he bathed... now
he is roaming the ship. He must
be the only Engineer in Starfleet
who does not go to Engineering!

Picard continues to walk around the perimeter of the
forcefield. He sees something on the ground -- a
GNARLED ROOT from a large nearby tree. The root is
poking out of the ground, leaving a small arch through
which daylight can be seen. Picard's mind begins
racing... he glances at Soran and then picks up a
pebble and, while keeping his eye on the root, he tosses
the pebble into the air, where it HITS the forcefield.

-- The forcefield FLASHES on briefly and Picard can see
that the bottom border of the field follows the contour
of the root. But it does not extend underneath the arch.

-- Soran turns at the sound of the crackling field.

SORAN
Careful, Captain. That's a fifty
gigawatt forcefield. I wouldn't
want to see you get hurt.

PICARD
Thank you.

Soran returns to working on the Launcher. but Picard
looks back down at the root... then walks away,
planning his next move.

Geordi is talking to an engineer named FARRELL, N.D.s
working in b.g. Mid-conversation.

FARRELL
I'd like to run a Level Three

GEORDI
Okay, let's do it.

They both move to consoles...

As before. On the screen, we can now see several of the
monitors in Engineering. On the left side of the
screen is the large cutaway view of the Enterprise.
Lursa suddenly reacts to something on the screen.

LURSA
That's it!
(to B'Etor)
Replay from time index four-two-
nine.

B'Etor works. The image on their monitor RUNS BACKWARD
for a moment and then FREEZES. On the screen, we can
see several of the monitors in Engineering. On the
left side of the screen is the large cutaway view of
the Enterprise. Lursa touches the diagram.

LURSA
(continuing)
Magnify this section and enhance.

B'Etor works. The picture ZOOMS IN on the cut-a-way
graphic and SHARPENS in FOCUS. There are several
blocks of numbers and text visible. Lursa studies the
image.

LURSA
Their shields are operating on a
modulation of two-five-seven point

103   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                     103

WHAM! Another HIT.

RIKER
Lock phasers and return fire!

The Enterprise FIRES at the Bird of Prey. but the
phaser shots are stopped by the Klingon SHIELDS, which
flash on when they're hit.

The Bird of Prey returns FIRE. The shot carves a
jagged tear in the Enterprise's hull.

Worf, that's an old Klingon ship.
What do we know about it? Are
there any weaknesses?

The ship is JOLTED. They all hold on.

WORF
It is a Class D-twelve Bird of
Prey. They were retired from
service because of defective
plasma coils.

RIKER
Plasma coils... is there any way
we can use that to our advantage?

WORF
I do not see how. The plasma coil
is part of their cloaking
device...

Riker suddenly gets an inspiration as the Bridge is
ROCKED.

RIKER
(to Data)
Could we access the defective coil
and trigger their cloak?

DATA
(considers)
Perhaps.
(suddenly enthusiastic)
Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic
pulse, it might reset the coil and
engage the cloaking systems.

WORF
(onto the idea)
As their cloak begins to engage,
their shields will drop.

RIKER
Right. And they'll be vulnerable
for at least two seconds.
(to Data)
Data, lock onto that plasma coil.

DATA
(confident)
No problem.

Data goes to work.

RIKER
Worf, prepare a spread of photon
torpedoes. We'll have to hit them
the instant they begin to cloak.

WORF
Aye, sir.

RIKER
We're only going to get one shot
at this. Target their primary
reactor. With any luck, their
warp core should implode.

Worf works.

108   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE   KLINGON SHIP (VFX-I)         108

The Enterprise ROLLS and TURNS back toward the planet,
tries to get away from the Klingon ship. But the Bird

Picard has made his way back to the gnarled root. He
stands a few feet away... a couple of pebbles in his
hand.

He glances at Soran, who's absorbed with his work on
the launcher.

Picard then surreptitiously TOSSES a pebble toward the
root. It misses and BOUNCES off the FORCEFIELD. Soran
looks over his shoulder at Picard, who sits down on a
rock. Soran returns to his work.

Picard tosses a second pebble -- this one also hits the
forcefield. Soran turns with a vaguely irritated look.

SORAN
(as if to a child)
Don't you have anything better to
do?

Picard doesn't respond. Soran goes back to work.

Picard waits a moment, then takes aim and TOSSES
another pebble toward the root. This time, the pebble
bounces underneath the arch and rolls onto the plateau -
inside the forcefield. Picard keeps his expression
neutral, but he's found a way in.

Soran is finishing his work on the launcher. On one of
the monitors on the control panel, we can now see alien
graphics and numbers ticking by -- obviously a
countdown in progress. Soran finishes and turns off
the control panel. He steps down and looks over at
Picard, who is standing near the forcefield.

SORAN
Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain,

Picard has dropped to the ground and is on his back -
he's trying to wriggle underneath the root. It's not
easy. he knows there's not much room between the
ground and the invisible field. he just gets his head
and shoulders underneath when he accidentally TOUCHES the
field and it CRACKLES violently around him --Picard is
jolted by the shock.

obscuring Picard  and the whole area momentarily.

-- Soran jumps down one level on the scaffolding, his
disruptor still in his hand, ready just in case Picard
somehow survived. Soran peers through the cloud of
dust and debris.

-- The dust from the explosion finally CLEARS... but
Picard is gone along with several feet of the ground
where he was crawling.

Soran is climbing up the scaffolding. He gets a couple
of levels up, and then suddenly a BOOT kicks him in the
face. Picard has made it inside the field.

A quick fight ensues, during which Picard is knocked a
few levels down on the scaffolding. He LANDS hard --
happens to look up into the sky. He sees something.--

down at the probe launcher, and realizes he's got one
chance. He rolls to his feet, runs toward the probe
launcher.

-- There is a THUNDEROUS ROAR as the launcher FIRES THE
PROBE into the sky.

-- The plateau is suddenly quiet as the probe streaks
toward the distant sun and disappears from view.
Picard gets to his knees, stares after the probe,
shocked. He's failed.

-- They watch the sun for a silent moment, waiting...

the wind whipping up on the plateau. He backs away at
the sight, coming to a stop with his back against the

He's lost and confused, unsure where he is or what's

keep pulling at him...

He is finally brought out into a larger room, dark.
The hands release him and he stands alone. He takes a
beat and tries to take control of the situation.

As the room comes into focus. The first thing we see
is an enormous, gaily decorated CHRISTMAS TREE
sparkling with hundreds of lights.

155   REVEAL THE ROOM                                            155

A 24th-century FRENCH LIVING ROOM. It is beautifully
decorated with lights, ornaments, holly. brightly
wrapped presents are clustered beneath the Christmas
tree. There are FIVE CHILDREN standing and sitting in
the room, all looking at Picard with bright, smiling
faces, waiting for him to say something.

Picard stares at the scene for a moment, unsure how to
react. Then we hear the woman's voice again, and we
move to reveal an attractive WOMAN in her forties
standing next to Picard.

WOMAN
Go on... say something. They're
waiting.

Picard is stunned.

PICARD
I... don't know what to say...

One of the children, a young GIRL, speaks up.

GIRL
Say Merry Christmas, Papa!

PICARD
(in a daze)
Merry... Christmas...

The children break out into applause. The woman kisses
him on the cheek, then steers him to a large,
overstuffed chair. Picard sits down and the
children starts handing out presents with much laughter
and chatting.

CHILDREN
This one's for you... where's
mine?... I hope this is the book
I asked for... take this one to
Papa...

As the activity swirls around him, Picard begins to
feel an immense  sense of satisfaction and happiness.
It's like a drug -- an overwhelming feeling of joy and
contentment fills Picard. It's a wondrous experience.
He settles back in the chair and a smile spreads across
his face. For reasons he cannot name and does not even
want to understand at the moment, he is very, very
happy.

GIRL
(to Picard)
Isn't the tree beautiful, Papa?

Picard answers as if it were the most natural thing in
the world.

PICARD
Oh yes... yes, it's astonishingly
beautiful. All of it.

All of the children now crowd around the chair with a
single large gift and hand it to Picard. One of the
younger boys speaks up.

YOUNG BOY
This is from all of us.

PICARD
Thank you... I can't imagine what
it is.

Picard tears open the box and pulls out a 19th century
SEXTANT - an old-fashioned nautical navigational
instrument. It's a beautiful piece with polished and
gleaming brass.

YOUNG BOY
(excited)
It's a sack-tent!

Picard eyes it with delight.

PICARD
You mean a sextant. And it's a
handsome one at that... from about
eighteen twenty, I'd say.
Wherever did you find it?

GIRL
It's a secret.

PICARD
(smiles)
Oh, a secret... well, that makes
it a doubly special gift. Thank
you... thank you all...

The children react with pleasure. They cluster around
him, showering him with hugs and kisses.

CHILDREN
Merry Christmas, Papa... I love
You, Father... etc.

Picard is covered in a blanket of love and affection.
The children pull back and return to their own
presents. There is a swirl of activity and commotion
as a warm and heartfelt Christmas morning is played
out.

WOMAN
(to Picard)
I'll go get dinner ready.
they'll be starving in a minute.

Picard nods as the woman EXITS the room. He looks
around the scene, utterly happy, utterly content.

The children continue to chatter and laugh among
themselves as Picard's eye falls on the glorious
Christmas tree. He can't help but smile as he looks
over the ornaments and decorations...

156   PICARD'S POV                                               156

of the sparkling lights and ornaments -- a swirl of
color and light.

157   PICARD                                                     157

His eye is caught by something in particular on the
tree. He leans forward slightly and stares at it.

158   PICARD'S POV (VFX-P)                                       158

His eye has been caught by an ORNAMENT near the
top of the tree. It is a large and beautiful glass
ball with a tiny LIGHT at the center in the shape of a
star. As Picard watches, the star suddenly GOES OUT...
and it radiates a SHIMMERING LIGHT EFFECT that expands
outward into the glass sphere.

It's a startling and beautiful ornament whose effect is
reminiscent of the star going out, as seen earlier in the
movie. But this is just coincidence. this is the way
the ornament was designed and it's simply one of many
ornaments on the tree.

159   PICARD                                                     159

reacts. The image of the ornament has touched a nerve
within him somewhere. It has reminded him of something
he'd nearly forgotten - a discordant note in an
otherwise wondrous and magical scene. He frowns, the
reverie momentarily disrupted. But he tries to push it
aside, not wanting the spell to be broken. He stands
and turns away from the tree and looks out a nearby
window -- it's snowing and the beautiful image of snow
soothes him for a moment. Then he reacts to something.

160   PICARD'S POV (VFX-P)                                       160

reflected on the pane of glass is the image of the
ornament -- it's still blinking. Picard now realizes
that this image is not going to go away... he can't
hide from it.

PICARD
No... this isn't right... this
can't be real...

GUINAN'S VOICE
It's as real as you want it to be.

Picard turns to see

161   GUINAN (VFX-P)                                             161

standing before him. She is wearing the same outfit
seen in the beginning of the movie on the Enterprise-B.
As they talk, the children and the woman continue to
move about their business as if Picard and Guinan
aren't there.

Picard is stunned.

PICARD
Guinan... what's going on? Where
am I?

GUINAN
You're in the Nexus.

Picard looks around.

PICARD
This... is the Nexus?

GUINAN
For you. This is where you wanted
to be...

PICARD
But I never had a wife, children,
a home like this...

GUINAN
Enjoy them, Jean-Luc...

Picard tries to make sense of it- he focuses on
Guinan.

PICARD
Guinan, what are you doing here?
I thought you were on the
Enterprise.

GUINAN
I am on the Enterprise...I am
also here.
(off his puzzled look)
Think of me as... an "echo" of the
person you know... a part of her
she left behind...

PICARD
Left behind...?

GUINAN
When the Enterprise-B beamed us
off the Lakul, we were partially
in the Nexus. The transporters
locked on to us... but somehow
everyone left a part of themselves
behind.

PICARD
Soran...?

GUINAN
All of us.

PICARD
Where is he now?

GUINAN
Wherever he wanted to be...

Guinan smiles at him.

BOY'S VOICE
Papa, help me build my castle!

Picard glances over at the boy, who is building a play
castle out of the 24th-century equivalent of "Lego".
For a moment, Picard is tempted to drift back to the
warm embrace of the fantasy...

PICARD
(to boy)
In a few minutes...

Picard looks around at the children... the lure to stay
here becoming more powerful.

PICARD
(continuing, awed, to
Guinan)
These are my children... my
children...

GUINAN
(smiles)
Yeah. They're great, aren't they?
You can go back and see them
born... go forward and see your
grandchildren... time has no
meaning here.

WOMAN'S VOICE
Dinner's ready! Let's go!

There's a general rush toward the adjacent dining room.
The youngest boy looks at Picard, goes over to him and
takes his hand.

BOY
Papa... are you coming?

Picard looks down into the face of his child. His
heart swells, the temptation to stay here and live this
out is profound. Almost in a trance, he takes a few
steps with the child toward the dining room... His eye
is caught again by the unusual ornament on the tree for a
moment... torn between the two images. and then, in
one of the most difficult moments of his life, he bends
down to the child...

PICARD
Go on... go on without me...

The boy looks at him quizzically for a moment, then
obeys his father and dashes off toward the dining room
to join the others. Picard straightens up and tries to
steel his voice.

PICARD
Guinan... can I leave the Nexus?

GUINAN
Why would you want to leave?

PICARD
(insistent)
Can I?

GUINAN
Yes... where would you go?

PICARD
I don't understand.

GUINAN
I told you, time has no meaning
here. If you leave, you can go
anywhere... any time.

Picard realizes the opportunity before him.

PICARD
I know exactly where I want to
go... and when. Back to that
mountaintop on Veridian Three...
before Soran put out the star. I
have to stop him.

GUINAN
What makes you think things will
be any different this time?

PICARD
You're right. I'll need help.
(beat)
Guinan, will you come back with
me? Together, we could --

GUINAN
I can't leave. I'm already there,
remember?

Picard looks crestfallen for a moment. Guinan gives
him an enigmatic smile.

GUINAN
I know just the guy.

Suddenly there's the cry of a HAWK from offscreen.
Picard turns at the sound --

162   EXT. KIRK'S HOME - DAY                                     162

Picard finds himself standing outside a rustic, but
Architecturally striking house with spectacular views
in the Canadian Rockies. A hawk is circling overhead,
making the crying sound that Picard heard. The air is
cold, frigid -- Picard can see his breath. Picard is
just starting to adjust to this sudden change in
location when he hears the sound of wood being CHOPPED
from around the corner of the house. Picard moves to
look around the corner and sees -

James T. Kirk. He's still in his uniform and looks
exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the
Enterprise-B at the beginning of the film. He is
vigorously chopping wood with an axe. He's enjoying
himself, lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual
labor. He's never felt this good in his life. There's
no trace of back pain or any other ailment. Picard
recognizes the famous Captain - as would any 24
Century Starfleet officer.

PICARD
James Kirk.

Kirk pauses, looks up at the strange man before him.
His expression is wondrous, almost child-like. Like in
Picard's Christmas sequence, Kirk is immersed in the
sensual feeling of the Nexus. It's like a dream that's
over-powered him.

KIRK
Beautiful day, isn't it?

PICARD
Yes... yes, it is.

Kirk points to a nearby log on the woodpile.

KIRK
Do you mind?

It takes Picard a beat before he realizes that Kirk
wants him to put the log on the chopping block for him.

PICARD
Oh.

Picard places the log on the block and Kirk gives it a
vigorous chop with the axe.

PICARD
Captain, do you realize what --

But Kirk interrupts as he sees something o.c.

KIRK
Wait a second. I think
something's burning.

Picard follows his look to see SMOKE billowing out of
one of the windows of the house. Kirk rushes into the
house, and Picard follows...

163   INT. KIRK'S HOME- KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS               163

Kirk rushes in. The kitchen's decor is 19th century
with a few 23rd Century touches -- copper pans and an
antique stove mixed comfortably with computer consoles
and Starfleet paraphernalia. Picard hesitates in the
doorway -- a little unsure about rushing into some
stranger's house.

Kirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove.
It's very hot -- he quickly sets it down near the sink,
waves the smoke away with his hand.

KIRK
Looks like someone was cooking
eggs...
(to Picard)
Come on in, it's all right. This
is my house -- or at least it used
to be, I sold it years ago.

Picard comes in and tries to orient Kirk to what's
going on.

PICARD
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
starship Enterprise.

Before Kirk can react to this remark, an antique CLOCK
on a shelf CHIMES as it strikes the hour. Kirk moves
to the shelf and looks at the clock in surprise and
wonder -- he is entranced by this experience, beginning
to connect with things and memories from his past.

KIRK
This clock... I gave this clock to
Bones...

PICARD
(pressing on)
I'm from what you would consider
the future... the twenty-fourth
century.

Kirk hears what Picard is saying, but like Picard in
his fantasy, he is more interested in the sights and
sounds around him. A dog barks from o.c. They both
look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets
Kirk with enthusiasm.

KIRK
(affectionately)
Jake! Jake, you miserable old
Mutt... How can you be here?
(to Picard)
He's been dead seven years.

Kirk is still looking around the kitchen when suddenly we
hear a WOMAN'S VOICE from somewhere upstairs that
stops Kirk in his tracks. As she speaks, we can see
the shock on Kirk's face.

ANTONIA'S VOICE
Come on, Jim, I'm starving. How
long are you going to be rattling
around that kitchen?

A beat.

KIRK
(amazed)
That's Antonia...

Kirk looks at the food on the stove. He's beginning to
realize something.

KIRK
Wait a minute...

Kirk glances at Picard.

KIRK
The future... what are you
talking about? This is the
past...

Kirk moves to a drawer and opens it. Inside is a
HORSESHOE with a tiny red bow tied to it. This
confirms things for Kirk. He picks up the horseshoe.

KIRK
This is nine years ago... the day
I told her I was going back to
Starfleet...

Kirk is swept up in the moment, overwhelmed by
memories, sensations, feelings. He goes back to the
frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden
burst of recognition.

KIRK
These were Ktarian eggs -- her
favorite.I was cooking them to
soften the blow...
(re: horseshoe)
And I gave her this.

Picard steps in.

PICARD
I know how real this must seem to
you, but it's not. This isn't
Really your house. We've both
been caught up in some sort of
temporal nexus.

But Kirk's mind is clearly elsewhere... he's being
swept away by the emotion of the moment... realizing the
opportunity he suddenly has.

KIRK
Dill weed.

Kirk indicates a shelf, as if asking Picard to go to
it.

KIRK
There's a bottle of dill weed on
the second shelf to the left,
right behind the nutmeg.

Kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs.
He cracks open two new eggs on the skillet and begins
preparing a breakfast. Picard waits for a moment, then
goes to the shelf, grabs the dill weed and hands it
to Kirk.

PICARD
How long have you been here?

Kirk takes the bottle and uses it to season the eggs.

KIRK
I don't know. I was on the
Enterprise-B... in the deflector
control room... keep stirring
these, will you?

Kirk moves to a cabinet and begins putting plates on a
breakfast tray. Picard is getting a little impatient,
but stirs the eggs anyway.

KIRK
(continuing)
The bulkhead in front of me
Disappeared... then I was out
there chopping wood.
(back to stove)
Thanks.

Kirk takes the pan of eggs back from Picard.

PICARD
History records that you died
saving the Enterprise-B from an
energy ribbon eighty years ago...

But Picard's words mean almost nothing to Kirk. He is
Thoroughly enjoying himself and Picard is almost a
distraction. Kirk begins serving the eggs onto the
plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the
tray.

KIRK
(amused)
So you're telling me this is the
twenty-fourth century... and I'm
dead?

PICARD
Not exactly. As I said, this is
some kind of...

KIRK
Temporal nexus... yeah, I heard you.
(frowns at tray)
Something's missing...

Then he remembers and turns to look at a nearby toaster --
as if on cue, two slices of toast pop out. Kirk grins
and puts the toast on the plates. Kirk picks up the
tray and heads for the door.

PICARD
Captain, I need your help. I want
you to leave the Nexus with me.

Kirk goes out of the kitchen and Picard follows...

164   INT. KIRK'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS          164

Kirk and Picard both on the move. Kirk heading for a
staircase.

PICARD
We have to go back to a planet
called Veridian III and stop a
man from destroying a star. There
are millions of lives at stake.

Kirk tries to keep it light, hoping this man will go
away.

KIRK
You said history considers me
dead. Who am I to argue with
history?

PICARD
You're a Starfleet Officer and you
have a duty to --

KIRK
(hard)
I don't need to be lectured by
you. I was out saving the galaxy
when your grandfather was still in
diapers. And frankly, I think the
galaxy owes me one
(beat)
I was like you once... so worried
about duty and obligations that I
couldn't see anything past this
uniform. And in the end, what did
it get me? Nothing. Not this
time.

Kirk brushes past Picard and stops at the foot of the
stairs.

KIRK
(looking up the stairs)
I'm going to walk up these stairs,
march into that bedroom and tell
Antonia that I want to marry her.

Kirk begins to climb the stairs.

KIRK
This time things are going to be
different.

He goes through a bedroom door and closes it behind
him. Picard glances around the room in frustration,
then gets a determined look on his face and marches up
the stairs after Kirk, grasps the doorknob, opens it
and steps through the door into

165   INT. BARN - DAY - CONTINUOUS                               165

Picard suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway
of a wooden barn. Straw on the floor... farm
implements on the walls... sunlight streaming in
through the slats. There are stalls in the barn with
a few horses visible.

Kirk is standing a short distance away -- he looks
surprised as well... and he is no longer holding the
tray of food.

PICARD
(re: barn)
This doesn't look like your
bedroom.

Kirk looks around for a moment, the pieces starting to
fall into place. He smiles with a growing
realization...

KIRK
No... no, it's not. It's better.

PICARD
Better?

KIRK
This is my uncle's barn in Iowa...

He points to a horse with a saddle on it.

KIRK
(re: horse)
I took that horse out for a ride
seven years ago... on a spring
day.

Kirk moves to the barn door and opens it revealing a
beautiful spring day.

KIRK
Just like this. If I'm right,
this is the day I met Antonia.

He turns to Picard.

KIRK
This Nexus of yours is very
clever. I can start all over
again -- do things right from day
one.

Kirk grabs the horse, swings up onto the saddle, and
rides out of the barn, filled with excitement. Picard
watches him for a moment, then looks at one of the
other horses in the barn. he makes a decision and
then moves toward a saddle hanging on the wall...

CUT TO:

166   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY (VFX-P)                             166

Kirk is riding his horse hard over the countryside --
and across a stream... through a thicket of trees... and
finally out onto a rolling plain. There is a large
RAVINE up ahead. Kirk sees it and smiles tightly. He
spurs his horse faster toward the ravine... The horse
is tearing along... comes up to the edge of the
precipice, and makes a daring leap to the other side.

Horse and rider land together and Kirk spurs the horse
on. But as he rides, we begin to see a change come
over him -- a look of doubt crosses his face.
Something's not right. He slows the horse to a trot...
and then to a complete stop. He sits there for a
moment and frowns. turns and looks back at the
ravine, which is now a fair distance away. Something
about that jump is nagging at him...

He turns his horse around and then digs in his heels.
The horse breaks into a gallop, racing back toward the
ravine.

Kirk grips the reins tight in his hands and then the
horse makes the LEAP across yet again.

This time when Kirk lands, he brings his horse to an
immediate stop. We can see on his face that something
is very wrong. He turns and stares at the ravine with
a mixture of shock and sadness on his face.

In the distance, Picard can be seen approaching on a
horse of his own. He stops next to Kirk. There is a
long, quiet moment as the two men sit there side by
side. Kirk is introspective as he sorts through his
feelings...

KIRK
(re: ravine)
I must have made this jump fifty
times. and every time it scared
the hell out of me. But not this
time.
(beat)
Because... it's not real.

A quiet beat. Kirk turns and looks toward a particular
hill in the distance, shading his eyes against the
bright sun. Picard follows his gaze and we can now see
the distant figure of a WOMAN walking her horse.

PICARD
(re: woman)
Antonia?

KIRK
(nods)
She's not real either, is she?
Nothing here is... nothing here
matters...

All euphoria is now gone from Kirk -- It's a moment of
self-revelation. He glances around.

KIRK
It's kinda like... orbital
skydiving. Exciting for a few
minutes... but in the end, you
haven't really done anything...
you haven't made a difference...

Kirk takes a beat, then looks at Picard. And in a way,
he's truly seeing him for the first time.

KIRK
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?

PICARD
That's right.

KIRK
Close to retirement?

PICARD
I hadn't planned on it.

There is a passion and a fervor in Kirk that we haven't
seen until now.

KIRK
Well, let me tell you something -
don't. Don't let them promote
you... don't let them transfer
you... don't let anything take you
off the Bridge of that ship...
(beat)
Because while you're there, you
can make a difference.

The two captains face each other for a moment. Picard
hears what Kirk is saying but also knows that's not the
whole story. Picard gives him a direct look, and there
is something in Picard's eyes -- a glint of resolve and
determination.

PICARD
You don't need to be on the Bridge
of a starship. Come with me.
Help me stop Soran.
(beat)
Make a difference again.

A long, silent beat as Kirk considers Picard. And slowly,
unexpectedly, a smile spreads across his face.

KIRK
How can I argue with the Captain
of the Enterprise?
(a beat)
What was the name of that
Planet... Veridian III?

PICARD
That's right.

KIRK
I take it the odds are against us,
and the situation is grim?

PICARD
You could say that.

KIRK
(musing)
Of course, if Spock were here,
he'd say I was being an
irrational, illogical human for
wanting to go on a mission like
that...

And for the first time, we can see the twinkle in his
eye that tells us Jim Kirk is back.

KIRK
Sounds like fun.

The two men turn and walk away from Antonia.and as
they walk, a ROAR OF COLOR AND SOUND WASHES OUT THE
SCREEN, as seen before.

FADE TO RED

FADE IN:

167   EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY (VFX-P)                             167

Soran is standing in front of the forcefield, facing
Picard.

SORAN
Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain,
I have an appointment with
Eternity and I don't want to be
late.

We realize we are watching the same events play out
again.

Soran turns and begins to climb up the scaffolding
toward the top of the rock face. Picard drops to the
ground on his back and begins to wriggle underneath
the forcefield. Picard accidentally TOUCHES the
field...

167A   SORAN (VFX-P)                                             167A

turns at the sound of the field, sees Picard, and then
draws his weapon. Soran quickly FIRES at Picard.

167B   THE GROUND (VFX-P)                                        167B

is BLASTED APART, creating a cloud of dirt and debris,
obscuring Picard and the whole area momentarily.

-- Soran jumps down one level, his disruptor still in his
hand, ready just in case Picard somehow survived.

Soran peers through the cloud of dust and debris.

-- The dust CLEARS... but Picard is gone along with
several feet of the ground where he was crawling.

167C   SORAN (VFX-I)                                             167C

Soran glances up at the sky and sees the ENERGY RIBBON,
then begins to climb the scaffolding. Suddenly a BOOT
kicks him in the head.

168   REVEAL KIRK                                                168

who is attacking Soran in Picard's place. The two men
begin to fight.

169   NEW ANGLE (VFX-P)                                          169

as Picard rushes to the probe launcher and steps up
onto the control platform and desperately begins trying
to shut down the launcher...

The following happens very quickly:

-- Kirk fights with Soran, hand-to-hand, brutal.

-- Picard works the control panel, trying to make sense
of it all. It won't respond. The control panel is
bizarre and confusing -- many different screens and
alien graphics. The alien countdown graphics continues
to race by.

169A   THE SKY (VFX-I)                                           169A

the distant energy ribbon can be seen getting closer...

169B   THE MOUNTAINTOP                   169B

Soran tries to pull his disruptor, but Kirk knocks it
to the ground. There's a struggle for the weapon...

-- Picard looks helplessly at the control panel.
Nothing he does has any effect. He keeps hitting
buttons...looking for other control panels, anything
to affect the launcher.

169C   ANGLE (VFX-P)                                             169C

Suddenly, Picard touches one particular control and the
screen CHANGES to an image of the Veridian SUN, held in
the center of the alien CROSS-HAIR.

169D   PICARD (VFX-P)                                            169D

begins working the control panel... desperate... he
looks at the screen... hits a control. Suddenly the
probe CLOAKS. Picard reacts at his mistake. Picard is
left standing on an invisible platform three feet in
the air -- a bizarre sight. Picard isn't sure what to
do -- he can feel the console, but he can't see any of
the controls.

-- Kirk punches Soran and sends him flying backward.
Soran lands heavily on the ground, unconscious. Kirk
stands over him, breathing heavily. He holds his back
in pain -- that old back pain from the beginning of the
movie.

PICARD
(desperate)
Kirk -- there's a control PADD in
his right pocket!

169E   KIRK (VFX-P)                                              169E

sees Picard standing in mid-air and then reaches down,
pulls the control PADD out of Soran's pocket. He
begins working it...

170   CLOSE ON SORAN                                             170

His eyes open... he sees what Kirk is doing... looks
around quickly... sees the disruptor lying a few feet
away, just beyond his reach...

171   THE PROBE LAUNCHER (VFX-P)                                 171

Decloaks. Picard goes back to working on the controls.

171A   KIRK (VFX-P)                           171A

he smiles.

KIRK
The twenty-fourth century isn't so
tough.

Without warning, Kirk is BLASTED forward, shot from
behind. Reveal Soran on the ground with the disruptor
in his hand. He gets up, whirls around, points the
weapon at Picard.

172   MOUNTAINTOP - WIDE                                         172

The probe is suddenly LAUNCHED in a roar of flame.
Soran freezes. His eyes follow the probe as it arcs
into the sky. The two men watch the probe as it heads
toward the sun...

172A   THE PROBE (VFX-I)                                         172A

makes a sweeping turn to the right and arcs back down
toward the planet. Soran watches in horror as the
probe crashes harmlessly into the distant jungle. We
hear a muffled explosion.

172B   SORAN (VFX-I)                                             172B

can't believe his dreams have been shattered. He looks
into the sky and sees the distant ribbon streaking
overhead. The disruptor falls from his hand as he
rushes to the top of the scaffolding.

173   PICARD                                                     173

moves to Kirk, checks his pulse. The Captain's eyes
flutter -- he's still holding on, but he's badly
wounded.

174   SORAN (VFX-I)                                              174

is standing on the rock ledge. He reaches up toward
the sky as if trying to grab the Ribbon with his bare
hands...but the ribbon passes by and disappears.

SORAN
No...

His look of shock turns to fury and madness. He turns
to Picard.

SORAN
YOU!!

174B   NEW ANGLE (VFX-P)                                         174B

He jumps down a few levels and then DIVES off the
scaffolding at Picard. But Picard is quicker. He
GRABS the disruptor and FIRES -- the BLAST CATCHES
SORAN IN MID-AIR .

Soran drops to the ground a short distance away. Dead.
The pocket watch has been shattered.

175   PICARD                                                     175

turns back to Kirk, cradles the dying man's head in his
lap. Kirk's eyes flick open, and he takes a ragged
breath.

KIRK
Nice shot.

Kirk coughs. His eyes flutter. He's fading fast.

PICARD
I'll find a way to contact the
Enterprise. You're going to be
all right.

KIRK
Did we do it? Did we make a
Difference...?

PICARD
Yes.
(beat)
Thank you.

KIRK
Least I could do...for a Captain
of the Enterprise.

Kirk coughs again

PICARD
Try to hang on.

Kirk looks up at the sky. the sunlight is warm on his
face. A quiet moment... then, with a last smile on his
face

KIRK
It was fun.

Kirk dies.

Hold te scene for a long moment, the two men in the
quiet clearing.

DISSOLVE TO:

176   EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - SUNSET                                  176

Close on Picard's hand

as he places a stone on a large pile of other stones.
MOVE TO REVEAL that Picard is placing the final few
rocks on Kirk's grave.

He reaches into a pocket and pulls out Kirk's command
insignia pin. He carefully places it on the grave...
and stands there silently for a few moments.

A distant WHINE of engines can be heard. Picard looks
up into the sky...

177   PICARD'S POV (VFX-I)                                       177

An Enterprise SHUTTLECRAFT is flying through the sky
toward the mountaintop.

178   EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - SUNSET                                  178

The shuttle has just landed, and the door OPENS as
Picard enters the clearing. Worf, Geordi and N.D.
security guards jump out to meet him.

WORF
Captain, are you all right?

PICARD
Yes.

LA FORGE
What about Doctor Soran?

PICARD
You needn't worry about the Doctor
anymore.

Picard moves toward the shuttle... then stops as he
notices that the shuttle is damaged. Picard turns and
notices for the first time that La Forge has a bandage on
his face and Worf's uniform is torn.

PICARD
Was there a problem with the
Klingons?

Worf and La Forge exchange a look.

GEORDI
You could say that...

CUT TO:

179   EXT. PLANET SURFACE - THE ENTERPRISE (WIDE SHOT) (VFX-I)   179

as seen before.

PICARD (V.O.)
Captain's log, stardate 48650.1.
The starship Farragut has arrived in
orbit and has begun to beam up
the Enterprise survivors for transport
back to Earth.

CUT TO:

180   INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - DAY                           180

A hive of activity -- Crewmembers moving about,
carrying personal effects, equipment, etc. Some
wounded people being carried on stretchers...

The corridor is lit by emergency beacons and a HATCH
has been opened at one end of the Corridor leading to
the exterior of the ship. Daylight and jungle can be
seen outside.

PICARD (V.O.)
(continuing)
Our casualties were light. but
unfortunately the Enterprise
herself cannot be salvaged.

MOVE ALONG the Corridor in find Beverly helping an
Injured crewmember into the arms of a waiting Medical
N.D. Ogawa walks up to her

OGAWA
That should be the last of the wounded,
Doctor.

Beverly nods. She looks exhausted.

BEVERLY
Two hundred thirty-two patients in
under two days.

Two medical N.D.s walk past, carrying an empty
stretcher. Beverly glances at them.

BEVERLY
(calls out)
Save that stretcher...

OGAWA
Is there another patient?

BEVERLY
No -- that one's for me.

CUT TO:

181    INT. ANOTHER LOCATION                                      181

Data and Troi are looking through rubble in a different
section of the ship with tricorders. Troi reacts to
something on the tricorder.

TROI
Over here, Data! I think I've
found something.

Data moves to her, with a hopeful and excited look.

TROI
(off tricorder)
One life sign, very faint.

Data hands his tricorder to Troi and then begins to
pull debris aside with android strength.

182   ANGLE ON DEBRIS                                            182

As Data pulls aside a large piece of plating, revealing
Spot the Cat sitting in the wreckage. She looks at
Data and gives a plaintive meow.

DATA
(relieved)
Spot.

He picks up the cat and holds it close, stroking its
fur. The cat purrs happily.

DATA
I am very happy to find you, Spot.

Troi smiles.

TROI
Another family reunited.

Data turns, revealing that there are tears in his eyes.
Troi is surprised and touched at the sight.

TROI
Data... are you all right?

DATA
I am not sure, Counselor. I am
happy to see Spot... and yet I am
crying. My emotional program must
be malfunctioning again.

Troi puts a gentle hand on him.

TROI
No, Data... I think it's working
perfectly.

Data looks up at her and smiles through his tears. OFF
the image of Data cuddling his cat.

CUT TO:

183   INT. READY ROOM - DAY                                      183

Picard and Riker are sifting through the rubble of what
once was the Ready Room, looking for something...

Riker sees something in the rubble.

RIKER
Is this it?

Riker holds up the family photo album seen earlier.

PICARD
(relieved)
Yes, Number One. Thank you.

He takes the album... brushes off the dust and flips
through the pages for a moment. Riker looks around the
wrecked room.

RIKER
I'm going to miss this ship. She
went before her time.

Picard has been rejuvenated by his experience... given
a new perspective on the issues of life and death.

PICARD
It's not how many years you've
lived, Wil... but how you've lived
them.
(beat)
Someone once told me that time is
a predator that stalks us all our
lives. But maybe time is also a
companion who goes with us on
our journey, and reminds us to
cherish the moments of our
lives... because they will never
come again.
(beat)
We are after all. only mortal.

A quiet moment... Riker finally smiles.

RIKER
Speak for yourself, sir. I kinda
planned on living forever.

Picard smiles back at him and the two men EXIT to...

184   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - DAY (VFX-P)                             184

Riker and Picard ENTER from the Ready Room. They look
around the wrecked Bridge for a moment. Riker glances
at the captain's chair.

RIKER
I always thought I'd have a crack
at this chair one day.

PICARD
You may still... somehow I doubt
this will be the last ship to
carry the name Enterprise.

A beat, then Picard hits his combadge.

PICARD
(continuing, to com)
Picard to Farragut. Two to beam
up.

The two men dematerialize.

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END

Episode IV

A NEW HOPE

From the
JOURNAL OF THE WHILLS

by
George Lucas

Revised Fourth Draft
January 15, 1976

LUCASFILM LTD.



A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...

A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title.
War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls
into infinity.

It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships,
striking from a hidden base, have won their first
victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal
secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the
Death Star, an armored space station with enough
power to destroy an entire planet.

Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess
Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of
the stolen plans that can save her people and
restore freedom to the galaxy...

The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total
eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny
silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers
from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed
by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly
laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing
the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.

INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN PASSAGEWAY

An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-
D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way
through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are
old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His
face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.
Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of
human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic
surface of an Art Deco design.

Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.

THREEPIO
Did you hear that? They've shut down
the main reactor. We'll be destroyed
for sure. This is madness!

Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in
the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.

THREEPIO
We're doomed!

The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that
only another robot could understand.

THREEPIO
There'll be no escape for the Princess
this time.

Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as
loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment
are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.

THREEPIO
What's that?

EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE

The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade
Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the
underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.

INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a
tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and
a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make
their way into the smoke-filled corridor.

In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with
laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns
creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck
behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers
who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered
arms and faces.

An explosion hits near the robots.

THREEPIO
I should have known better than to
trust the logic of a half-sized
thermocapsulary dehousing assister...

Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages
around the two hapless robots.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY

A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.
The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone
figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations
who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy
hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable
lad with a prize-winning smile.

A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a
large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the
desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided
by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot
appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.
A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and
he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his
utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying
the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired
Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet
above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the
tiny robot to follow him.

LUKE
Hurry up! Come with me! What are you
waiting for?! Get in gear!

The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and
smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his
arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps
into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum
madly.

INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY

The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his
way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is
Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured
by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which
stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the
Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away
from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through
the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run
in a frenzied panic.

INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.
Artoo makes beeping sounds.

INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER

Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is
nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel
soldiers can be heard in the distance.

THREEPIO
Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?

A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and
he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-
filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years
old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place,
dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting
something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little
robot joins his companion.

THREEPIO
At last! Where have you been?

Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.

THREEPIO
They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do? We'll be
sent to the spice mine of Kessel or
smashed into who knows what!

Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the
subhallway. Threepio chases after him.

THREEPIO
Wait a minute, where are you going?

Artoo responds with electronic beeps.

INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - CORRIDOR

The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies
of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as
an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.

IMPERIAL OFFICER
The Death Star plans are not in the
main computer.

Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles
in vain.

VADER
Where are those transmissions you
intercepted?

Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.

VADER
What have you done with those plans?

REBEL OFFICER
We intercepted no transmissions.
Aaah... This is a consular ship.
Were on a diplomatic mission.

VADER
If this is a consular ship... were
is the Ambassador?

The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the
Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a
gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp.
Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to
his troops.

VADER
Commander, tear this ship apart until
you've found those plans and bring
me the Ambassador. I want her alive!

The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.

INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY

The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the
stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia
Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her
eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds
of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the
troopers spots her.

TROOPER
There she is! Set for stun!

Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with
her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a
paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.

TROOPER
She'll be all right. Inform Lord
Vader we have a prisoner.

INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY

Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod.
He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light
begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into
the cramped four-man pod.

THREEPIO
Hey, you're not permitted in there.
It's restricted. You'll be deactivated
for sure..

Artoo beeps something to him.

THREEPIO
Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease! Now
come out before somebody sees you.

Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding
the mission he is about to perform.

THREEPIO
Secret mission? What plans? What are
you talking about? I'm not getting
in there!

Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps
and twangs angrily.

A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris
through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and,
after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky
robot jumps into the lifepod.

THREEPIO
I'm going to regret this.

INT. IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER

On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified
robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.

CHIEF PILOT
There goes another one.

CAPTAIN
Hold your fire. There are no life
forms. It must have been short-
circuited.

INT. LIFEPOD

Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship.
Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.

THREEPIO
That's funny, the damage doesn't
look as bad from out here.

Artoo beeps an assuring response.

THREEPIO
Are you sure this things safe?

EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY

Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white
buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty
empty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to
get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist
at Luke as he flies past.

WOMAN
I've told you kids to slow down!

INT. POWER STATION - DAY

Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged
mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been
asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the
office, yelling wildly.

FIXER
Did I hear a young noise blast through
here?

CAMIE
It was just wormie on another rampage.

Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak
and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are
playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly,
handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy
city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics
of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the
background.

LUKE
Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?

Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great
joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.

LUKE
I didn't know you were back! When
did you get in?

BIGGS
Just now. I wanted to surprise you,
hot shot. I thought you'd be here...
certainly didn't expect you to be
out working.
(he laughs)

LUKE
The Academy didn't change you
much...but you're back so soon? Hey,
what happened, didn't you get your
commission?

Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.

BIGGS
Of course I got it. Signed aboard
The Rand Ecliptic last week. First
mate Biggs Darklighter at your
service...
(he salutes)
...I just came to say good-bye to
all you unfortunate landlocked
simpletons.

Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend
is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of
it.

LUKE
I almost forgot. There's a battle
going on! Right here in our system.
Come and look!

DEAK
Not again! Forget it.

EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD - SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION -
DAY

The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie
and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes.
Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.

LUKE
There they are!

Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to
see something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars
Biggs sees two small silver specks.

BIGGS
That's no battle, hot shot... they're
just sitting there! Probably a
freighter-tanker refueling.

LUKE
But there was a lot of firing
earlier...

Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the
building in the process. Luke grabs them.

LUKE
Hey, easy with those...

CAMIE
Don't worry about it, Wormie.

The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs
his shoulders in resignation.

FIXER
I keep telling you, the Rebellion is
a long way from here. I doubt if the
Empire would even fight to keep this
system. Believe me Luke, this planet
is a big hunk of nothing...

Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The
group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about
Luke's ineptitude.

INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY

Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad
of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is
brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly
marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader
emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard
at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.

LEIA
Lord Vader, I should have known.
Only you could be so bold. The
Imperial Senate will not sit for
this, when they hear you've attacked
a diplomatic...

VADER
Don't play games with me, Your
Highness. You weren't on any mercy
mission this time. You passed directly
through a restricted system. Several
transmissions were beamed to this
ship by Rebel spies. I want to know
what happened to the plans they sent
you.

LEIA
I don't know what you're talking
about. I'm a member of the Imperial
Senate on a diplomatic mission to
Alderaan...

VADER
You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...
and a traitor. Take her away!

Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering
hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander
turns to Vader.

COMMANDER
Holding her is dangerous. If word of
this gets out, it could generate
sympathy for the Rebellion in the
senate.

VADER
I have traced the Rebel spies to
her. Now she is my only link to find
their secret base!

COMMANDER
She'll die before she tells you
anything.

VADER
Leave that to me. Send a distress
signal and then inform the senate
that all aboard were killed!

Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander.
They stop and snap to attention.

SECOND OFFICER
Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship! And no
transmissions were made. An escape
pod was jettisoned during the
fighting, but no life forms were
aboard.

Vader turns to the Commander.

VADER
She must have hidden the plans in
the escape pod. Send a detachment
down to retrieve them. See to it
personally, Commander. There'll be
no one to stop us this time.

COMMANDER
Yes, sir.

EXT. SPACE

The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the
planet Tatooine.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT

Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas
meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids
kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily
work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in
the distance rests half buried in the sand.

THREEPIO
How did I get into this mess? I really
don't know how. We seem to be made
to suffer. It's our lot in life.

Artoo answers with beeping sounds.

THREEPIO
I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen.

Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.

THREEPIO
What a desolate place this is.

Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts
off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio
stops and yells at him.

THREEPIO
Where are you going?

A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small
robot.

THREEPIO
Well, I'm not going that way. It's
much too rocky. This way is much
easier.

Artoo counters with a long whistle.

THREEPIO
What makes you think there are
settlements over there?

Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

THREEPIO
Don't get technical with me.

Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

THREEPIO
What mission? What are you talking
about? I've had just about enough of
you! Go that way! You'll be
malfunctioning within a day, you
nearsighted scrap pile!

Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the
direction of the vast dune sea.

THREEPIO
And don't let me catch you following
me begging for help, because you
won't get it.

Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges
off in the direction of the towering mesas.

THREEPIO
No more adventures. I'm not going
that way.

Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant
mountains.

EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA

Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a
dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless
miles.  He looks back in the direction of the now distant
rock mesas.

THREEPIO
That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault! He tricked me
into going this way, but he'll do no
better.

In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand
from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of
reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving
towards him.

THREEPIO
Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm
saved!

The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the
approaching transport.

THREEPIO
Over here! Help! Please, help!

EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY

Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer
and the others can be heard working inside.

LUKE
(Very animated)
...so I cut off my power, shut down
the afterburners and came in low on
Deak's trail. I was so close I thought
I was going to fry my instruments.
As it was I busted up the Skyhopper
pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty
upset. He grounded me for the rest
of the season. You should have been
there... it was fantastic.

BIGGS
You ought to take it easy Luke. You
may be the hottest bushpilot this
side of Mos Eisley, but those little
Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it
up, and one day, whammo, you're going
to be nothing more than a dark spot
on the down side of a canyon wall.

LUKE
Look who's talking. Now that you've
been around those giant starships
you're beginning to sound like my
uncle. You've gotten soft in the
city...

BIGGS
I've missed you kid.

LUKE
Well, things haven't been the same
since you left, Biggs. It's been
so... quiet.

Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.

BIGGS
Luke, I didn't come back just to say
good-bye... I shouldn't tell you
this, but you're the only one I can
trust... and if I don't come back, I
want somebody to know.

Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.

LUKE
What are you talking about?

BIGGS
I made some friends at the Academy.
(he whispers)
...when our frigate goes to one of
the central systems, we're going to
jump ship and join the Alliance...

Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.

LUKE
Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding!
How?

BIGGS
Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth
bigger than a meteor crater!

LUKE
I'm sorry. I'm quiet.
(he whispers)
Listen how quiet I am. You can barely
hear me...

Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.

BIGGS
My friend has a friend on Bestine
who might help us make contact.

LUKE
You're crazy! You could wander around
forever trying to find them.

BIGGS
I know it's a long shot, but if I
don't find them I'll do what I can
on my own... It's what we always
talked about. Luke, I'm not going to
wait for the Empire to draft me into
service. The Rebellion is spreading
and I want to be on the right side --
the side I believe in.

LUKE
And I'm stuck here...

BIGGS
I thought you were going to the
Academy next term. You'll get your
chance to get off this rock.

LUKE
Not likely! I had to cancel my
application. There has been a lot of
unrest among the Sandpeople since
you left... they've even raided the
outskirts of Anchorhead.

BIGGS
Your uncle could hold off a whole
colony of Sandpeople with one blaster.

LUKE
I know, but he's got enough vaporators
going to make the place pay off. He
needs me for just one more season. I
can't leave him now.

BIGGS
I feel for you, Luke, you're going
to have to learn what seems to be
important or what really is important.
What good is all your uncle's work
if it's taken over by the Empire?...
You know they're starting to
nationalize commerce in the central
systems... it won't be long before
your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving
for the greater glory of the Empire.

LUKE
It couldn't happen here. You said it
yourself. The Empire won't bother
with this rock.

BIGGS
Things always change.

LUKE
I wish I was going... Are you going
to be around long?

BIGGS
No, I'm leaving in the morning...

LUKE
Then I guess I won't see you.

BIGGS
Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.

LUKE
Well, I'll be at the Academy next
season... after that who knows. I
won't be drafted into the Imperial
Starfleet that's for sure... Take
care of yourself, you'll always be
the best friend I've got.

BIGGS
So long, Luke.

Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the
power station.

EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SUNSET

The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange
foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures
fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock
canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he
goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for
a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.

In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall
and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little
further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a
pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the
narrow path.

The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until
suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out
of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages
one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his
back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then
off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller
than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they
cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and
their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be
seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave
the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down
the trail.

EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET

The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-
like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a
small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a
large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot
is sucked into the giant machine.

The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders
and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.

INT. SANDCRAWLER - HOLD AREA

It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo
switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles
around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty
metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and
maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper
and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end
of the chamber.

INT. SANDCRAWLER - PRISON AREA

Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the
middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various
shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation,
while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls
out from the gloom.

THREEPIO
Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!

A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.

EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - SANDCRAWLER - SUNSET

The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent
twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain
ridge.

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - DAY

Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-
buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine.
A trooper yells to an officer some distance away.

FIRST TROOPER
Someone was in the pod. The tracks
go off in this direction.

A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand
and gives it to the first trooper.

SECOND TROOPER
Look, sir -- droids.

EXT. TATOOINE - DUNES

The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.

INT. SANDCRAWLER

Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped
prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.

THREEPIO
Wake up! Wake up!

Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops,
creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.
Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights
pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long
chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding
white light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the
odd assortment of robots.

THREEPIO
We're doomed.

A Jawa starts moving toward them.

THREEPIO
Do you think they'll melt us down?

Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.

THREEPIO
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this
never end?

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON

The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their
battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of
the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small
homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground
surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small
adobe block house.

The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening
them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow.
The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting
small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils
should be.

Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars,
a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are
sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully
inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump-
shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little
Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales
pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.

A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the
homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru
standing in the main courtyard.

BERU
Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a
translator to be sure it speaks Bocce.

LUKE
It looks like we don't have much of
a choice but I'll remind him.

Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment
for sale with the Jawa leader.

OWEN
I have no need for a protocol droid.

THREEPIO
(quickly)
Sir -- not in an environment such as
this -- that's why I've also been
programmed for over thirty secondary
functions that...

OWEN
What I really need is a droid that
understands the binary language of
moisture vaporators.

THREEPIO
Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was
programming binary load lifter...
very similar to your vaporators. You
could say...

OWEN
Do you speak Bocce?

THREEPIO
Of course I can, sir. It's like a
second language for me... I'm as
fluent in Bocce...

OWEN
All right shut up!
(turning to Jawa)
I'll take this one.

THREEPIO
Shutting up, sir.

OWEN
Luke, take these two over to the
garage, will you? I want you to have
both of them cleaned up before dinner.

LUKE
But I was going into Toshi Station
to pick up some power converters...

OWEN
You can waste time with your friends
when your chores are done. Now come
on, get to it!

LUKE
All right, come on! And the red one,
come on. Well, come on, Red, let's
go.

As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back
into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep
and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained
by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.

Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two
robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the
head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.

LUKE
Uncle Owen...

OWEN
Yeah?

LUKE
This R2 unit has a bad motivator.
Look!

OWEN
(to the head Jawa)
Hey, what're you trying to push on
us?

The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked
out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract
attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps
Luke on the shoulder.

THREEPIO
(pointing to Artoo)
Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is
in prime condition. A real bargain.

LUKE
Uncle Owen...

OWEN
Yeah?

LUKE
What about that one?

OWEN
(to Jawa)
What about that blue one? We'll take
that one.

With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged
astro-droid for Artoo.

LUKE
Yeah, take it away.

THREEPIO
Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very
pleased with that one, sir. He really
is in first-class condition. I've
worked with him before. Here he comes.

Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots
trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.

LUKE
Okay, let's go.

THREEPIO
(to Artoo)
Now, don't you forget this! Why I
should stick my neck out for you is
quite beyond my capacity!

INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful
atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers
himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the
battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery
with a cord to his face.

THREEPIO
Thank the maker! This oil bath is
going to feel so good. I've got such
a bad case of dust contamination, I
can barely move!

Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought
as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man
Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage.
Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he
slams a wrench across the workbench.

LUKE
It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is
right. I'm never gonna get out of
here!

THREEPIO
Is there anything I might do to help?

Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains
and a tiny smile creeps across his face.

LUKE
Well, not unless you can alter time,
speed up the harvest, or teleport me
off this rock!

THREEPIO
I don't think so, sir. I'm only a
droid and not very knowledgeable
about such things. Not on this planet,
anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm
not even sure which planet I'm on.

LUKE
Well, if there's a bright center to
the universe, you're on the planet
that it's farthest from.

THREEPIO
I see, sir.

LUKE
Uh, you can call me Luke.

THREEPIO
I see, sir Luke.

LUKE
(laughing)
Just Luke.

THREEPIO
And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg
relations, and this is my counterpart,
Artoo-Detoo.

LUKE
Hello.

Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to
scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome
pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping
oil from his bronze body.

LUKE
You got a lot of carbon scoring here.
It looks like you boys have seen a
lot of action.

THREEPIO
With all we've been through, sometimes
I'm amazed we're in as good condition
as we are, what with the Rebellion
and all.

LUKE
You know of the Rebellion against
the Empire?

THREEPIO
That's how we came to be in your
service, if you take my meaning,
sir.

LUKE
Have you been in many battles?

THREEPIO
Several, I think. Actually, there's
not much to tell. I'm not much more
than an interpreter, and not very
good at telling stories. Well, not
at making them interesting, anyways.

Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's
neck joint. He uses a larger pick.

LUKE
Well, my little friend, you've got
something jammed in here real good.
Were you on a cruiser or...

The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke tumbling
head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-
dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being
projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a
rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly
lit garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.

LEIA
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my
only hope.

LUKE
What's this?

Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for Threepio
to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment
over and over.

THREEPIO
What is what?!? He asked you a
question...
(pointing to Leia)
What is that?

Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice
the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer
for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the
sentence fragment over and over.

LEIA
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my
only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

THREEPIO
Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely
a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no
mind.

Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.

LUKE
Who is she? She's beautiful.

THREEPIO
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

LEIA
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...

THREEPIO
I think she was a passenger on our
last voyage. A person of some
importance, sir -- I believe. Our
captain was attached to...

LUKE
Is there more to this recording?

Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic
squeaks and a whistle.

THREEPIO
Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going
to get us in trouble. It's all right,
you can trust him. He's our new
master.

Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.

THREEPIO
He says he's the property of Obi-Wan
Kenobi, a resident of these parts.
And it's a private message for him.
Quite frankly, sir I don't know what
he's talking about. Our last master
was Captain Antilles, but with what
we've been through, this little R2
unit has become a bit eccentric.

LUKE
Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means
old Ben Kenobi?

THREEPIO
I beg your pardon, sir, but do you
know what he's talking about?

LUKE
Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-
Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond
the dune sea. He's kind of a strange
old hermit.

Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few
moments.

LUKE
I wonder who she is. It sounds like
she's in trouble. I'd better play
back the whole thing.

Artoo beeps something to Threepio.

THREEPIO
He says the restraining bolt has
short circuited his recording system.
He suggests that if you remove the
bolt, he might be able to play back
the entire recording.

Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't
really heard what Threepio has been saying.

LUKE
H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're
too small to run away on me if I
take this off! Okay.

Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off
Artoo's side.

LUKE
There you go.

The princess immediately disappears...

LUKE
Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go?
Bring her back! Play back the entire
message.

Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in
embarrassment.

THREEPIO
What message? The one you're carrying
inside your rusty innards!

A women's voice calls out from another room.

AUNT BERU
Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!

Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning
robot.

LUKE
All right, I'll be right there, Aunt
Beru.

THREEPIO
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to
have picked up a slight flutter.

Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and
hurries out of the room.

LUKE
Well, see what you can do with him.
I'll be right back.

THREEPIO
(to Artoo)
Just you reconsider playing that
message for him.

Artoo beeps in response.

THREEPIO
No, I don't think he likes you at
all.

Artoo beeps.

THREEPIO
No, I don't like you either.

INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - DINING AREA

Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher
with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-
used kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls
of food and starts for the dining area.

Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with
steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red
grain.

LUKE
You know, I think that R2 unit we
bought might have been stolen.

OWEN
What makes you think that?

LUKE
Well, I stumbled across a recording
while I was cleaning him. He says he
belongs to someone called Obi-Wan
Kenobi.

Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but
manages to control himself.

LUKE
I thought he might have meant old
Ben. Do you know what he's talking
about? Well, I wonder if he's related
to Ben.

Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.

OWEN
That old man's just a crazy old
wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take
that R2 unit into Anchorhead and
have its memory flushed. That'll be
the end of it. It belongs to us now.

LUKE
But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking
for him?

OWEN
He won't, I don't think he exists
any more. He died about the same
time as your father.

LUKE
He knew my father?

OWEN
I told you to forget it. Your only
concern is to prepare the new droids
for tomorrow. In the morning I want
them on the south ridge working out
those condensers.

LUKE
Yes, sir. I think those new droids
are going to work out fine. In fact,
I, uh, was also thinking about our
agreement about my staying on another
season. And if these new droids do
work out, I want to transmit my
application to the Academy this year.

Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress
it.

OWEN
You mean the next semester before
harvest?

LUKE
Sure, there're more than enough
droids.

OWEN
Harvest is when I need you the most.
Only one more season. This year we'll
make enough on the harvest so I'll
be able to hire some more hands. And
then you can go to the Academy next
year.

Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his uncle.

OWEN
You must understand I need you here,
Luke.

LUKE
But it's a whole 'nother year.

OWEN
Look, it's only one more season.

Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.

LUKE
Yeah, that's what you said last year
when Biggs and Tank left.

AUNT BERU
Where are you going?

LUKE
It looks like I'm going nowhere. I
have to finish cleaning those droids.

Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen
mechanically finishes his dinner.

AUNT BERU
Owen, he can't stay here forever.
Most of his friends have gone. It
means so much to him.

OWEN
I'll make it up to him next year. I
promise.

AUNT BERU
Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He
has too much of his father in him.

OWEN
That's what I'm afraid of.

EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a
distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few
moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the
homestead.

INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE

Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in
sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt
similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the
box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a
short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.

LUKE
What are you doing hiding there?

Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in
sight.

THREEPIO
It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't
deactivate me. I told him not to go,
but he's faulty, malfunctioning;
kept babbling on about his mission.

LUKE
Oh, no!

Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.

EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead
and searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro-
robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the
salt flat as Luke scans the landscape with his
electrobinoculars.

THREEPIO
That R2 unit has always been a
problem. These astro-droids are
getting quite out of hand. Even I
can't understand their logic at times.

LUKE
How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere
in sight. Blast it!

THREEPIO
Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go
after him?

LUKE
It's too dangerous with all the
Sandpeople around. We'll have to
wait until morning.

Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.

OWEN
Luke, I'm shutting the power down
for the night.

LUKE
All right, I'll be there in a few
minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.

He takes one final look across the dim horizon.

LUKE
You know that little droid is going
to cause me a lot of trouble.

THREEPIO
Oh, he excels at that, sir.

INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - PLAZA

Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of
the open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of
Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.

OWEN
Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be
loafing now!

INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - KITCHEN

The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru
prepares the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.

OWEN
Have you seen Luke this morning?

AUNT BERU
He said he had some things to do
before he started today, so he left
early.

OWEN
Uh? Did he take those two new droids
with him?

AUNT BERU
I think so.

OWEN
Well, he'd better have those units
in the south range repaired be midday
or there'll be hell to pay!

EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - LUKE'S SPEEDER - DAY

The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio
pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast
wasteland.

INT. EXT. LUKE'S SPEEDER - DESERT WASTELAND - TRAVELING -
DAY

Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something
in the motor compartment.

LUKE
(yelling)
How's that.

Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the
wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.

LUKE
Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this
direction somewhere, but I don't see
how that R2 unit could have come
this far. We must have missed him.
Uncle Owen isn't going to take this
very well.

THREEPIO
Sir, would it help if you told him
it was my fault.

LUKE
(brightening)
Sure. He needs you. He'd probably
only deactivate you for a day or
so...

THREEPIO
Deactivate! Well, on the other hand
if you hadn't removed his restraining
bolt...

LUKE
Wait, there's something dead ahead
on the scanner. It looks like our
droid... hit the accelerator.

EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - DUNE SEA - COASTLINE - DAY

From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen
gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground
two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert
cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the
marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle
and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs
the gun before it can be fired.

The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes called,
speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into an
animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in
the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.

EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK MESA - CANYON

The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied
to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large
as elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns,
and long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders
mount saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs
and ride off down the rugged bluff.

EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR

The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke,
with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands
before little Artoo.

LUKE
Hey, whoa, just where do you think
you're going?

The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses
menacingly behind the little runaway.

THREEPIO
Master Luke here is your rightful
owner. We'll have no more of this
Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't
talk to me about your mission, either.
You're fortunate he doesn't blast
you into a million pieces right here.

LUKE
Well, come on. It's getting late. I
only hope we can get back before
Uncle Owen really blows up.

THREEPIO
If you don't mind my saying so, sir,
I think you should deactivate the
little fugitive until you've gotten
him back to your workshop.

LUKE
No, he's not going to try anything.

Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of frantic
whistles and screams.

LUKE
What's wrong with him now?

THREEPIO
Oh my... sir, he says there are
several creatures approaching from
the southeast.

Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.

LUKE
Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's
have a look. Come on.

EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - RIDGE - DAY

Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and
scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the
two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young
adventurer.

LUKE
There are two Banthas down there but
I don't see any... wait a second,
they're Sandpeople all right. I can
see one of them now.

Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his
electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of
his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large,
gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled
and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be
heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles
down the side of the mountain.

The towering creature brings down his curved, double-pointed
gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has struck terror in
the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to block
the blow with his laser rifle, which is smashed to pieces.
The terrified farm boy scrambles backward until he is forced
to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands
over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible
shrieking laugh.

EXT. TATOOINE - ROCK CANYON - FLOOR - DAY

Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in
the rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the
inert Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the
speeder.  The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts
and supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then
everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan
is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the
Sandpeople fleeing in terror.

Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight
swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even
closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and
leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and
weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating
eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes
as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a
slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.

BEN
Hello there! Come here my little
friend. Don't be afraid.

Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a heap and
begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben puts his hand on
Luke's forehead and he begins to come around.

BEN
Don't worry, he'll be all right.

LUKE
What happened?

BEN
Rest easy, son, you've had a busy
day. You're fortunate you're still
in one piece.

LUKE
Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to
see you!

BEN
The Jundland wastes are not to be
traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke,
what brings you out this far?

LUKE
Oh, this little droid! I think he's
searching for his former master...
I've never seen such devotion in a
droid before... there seems to be no
stopping him. He claims to be the
property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he
a relative of yours? Do you know who
he's talking about?

Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.

BEN
Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats
a name I haven't heard in a long
time... a long time.

LUKE
I think my uncle knew him. He said
he was dead.

BEN
Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet.

LUKE
You know him!

BEN
Well of course, of course I know
him. He's me! I haven't gone by the
name Obi-Wan since oh, before you
were born.

LUKE
Then the droid does belong to you.

BEN
Don't seem to remember ever owning a
droid. Very interesting...

He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.

BEN
I think we better get indoors. The
Sandpeople are easily startled but
they will soon be back and in greater
numbers.

Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic
beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.

LUKE
Threepio!

EXT. TATOOINE - SAND PIT - ROCK MESA - DAY

Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins
to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and
Ben stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half
buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.

Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and then
flips a hidden switch on his back several times until finally
the mechanical man's systems turn on.

THREEPIO
Where am I? I must have taken a bad
step...

LUKE
Can you stand? We've got to get out
of here before the Sandpeople return.

THREEPIO
I don't think I can make it. You go
on, Master Luke. There's no sense in
you risking yourself on my account.
I'm done for.

Artoo makes a beeping sound.

LUKE
No, you're not. What kind of talk is
that?

Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little
Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around
suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the
air.

BEN
Quickly, son... they're on the move.

INT. KENOBI'S DWELLING

The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but
still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and
security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as
old Ben sits thinking.

LUKE
No, my father didn't fight in the
wars. He was a navigator on a spice
freighter.

BEN
That's what your uncle told you. He
didn't hold with your father's ideals.
Thought he should have stayed here
and not gotten involved.

LUKE
You fought in the Clone Wars?

BEN
Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the
same as your father.

LUKE
I wish I'd known him.

BEN
He was the best star-pilot in the
galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I
understand you've become quite a
good pilot yourself. And he was a
good friend. Which reminds me...

Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.
As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the
restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.
Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the
table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle
with several electronic gadgets attached to it.

BEN
I have something here for you. Your
father wanted you to have this when
you were old enough, but your uncle
wouldn't allow it. He feared you
might follow old Obi-Wan on some
damned-fool idealistic crusade like
your father did.

THREEPIO
Sir, if you'll not be needing me,
I'll close down for awhile.

LUKE
Sure, go ahead.

Ben hands Luke the saber.

LUKE
What is it?

BEN
Your fathers lightsaber. This is the
weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy
or as random as a blaster.

Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out
about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across
the ceiling.

BEN
An elegant weapon for a more civilized
time. For over a thousand generations
the Jedi Knights were the guardians
of peace and justice in the Old
Republic. Before the dark times,
before the Empire.

Luke hasn't really been listening.

LUKE
How did my father die?

BEN
A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who
was a pupil of mine until he turned
to evil, helped the Empire hunt down
and destroy the Jedi Knights. He
betrayed and murdered your father.
Now the Jedi are all but extinct.
Vader was seduced by the dark side
of the Force.

LUKE
The Force?

BEN
Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi
his power. It's an energy field
created by all living things. It
surrounds us and penetrates us. It
binds the galaxy together.

Artoo makes beeping sounds.

BEN
Now, let's see if we can't figure
out what you are, my little friend.
And where you come from.

LUKE
I saw part of the message he was...

Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful
young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.

BEN
I seem to have found it.

Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers before
his eyes.

LEIA
General Kenobi, years ago you served
my father in the Clone Wars. Now he
begs you to help him in his struggle
against the Empire. I regret that I
am unable to present my father's
request to you in person, but my
ship has fallen under attack and I'm
afraid my mission to bring you to
Alderaan has failed. I have placed
information vital to the survival of
the Rebellion into the memory systems
of this R2 unit. My father will know
how to retrieve it. You must see
this droid safely delivered to him
on Alderaan. This is our most
desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan
Kenobi, you're my only hope.

There is a little static and the transmission is cut short.
Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs
on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.

BEN
You must learn the ways of the Force
if you're to come with me to Alderaan.

LUKE
(laughing)
Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan.
I've got to go home. It's late, I'm
in for it as it is.

BEN
I need your help, Luke. She needs
your help. I'm getting too old for
this sort of thing.

LUKE
I can't get involved! I've got work
to do! It's not that I like the
Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing
I can do about it right now. It's
such a long way from here.

BEN
That's your uncle talking.

LUKE
(sighing)
Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever
going to explain this?

BEN
Learn about the Force, Luke.

LUKE
Look, I can take you as far as
Anchorhead. You can get a transport
there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're
going.

BEN
You must do what you feel is right,
of course.

EXT. SPACE.

An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like
battle station: the Death Star!

INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM

Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black
conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around
the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general,
is speaking.

TAGGE
Until this battle station is fully
operational we are vulnerable. The
Rebel Alliance is too well equipped.
They're more dangerous than you
realize.

The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.

MOTTI
Dangerous to your starfleet,
Commander, not to this battle station!

TAGGE
The Rebellion will continue to gain
a support in the Imperial Senate as
long as....

Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut
short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial
outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally,
The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and
bow before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his
place at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind
him.

TARKIN
The Imperial Senate will no longer
be of any concern to us. I've just
received word that the Emperor has
dissolved the council permanently.
The last remnants of the Old Republic
have been swept away.

TAGGE
That's impossible! How will the
Emperor maintain control without the
bureaucracy?

TARKIN
The regional governors now have direct
control over territories. Fear will
keep the local systems in line. Fear
of this battle station.

TAGGE
And what of the Rebellion? If the
Rebels have obtained a complete
technical readout of this station,
it is possible, however unlikely,
that they might find a weakness and
exploit it.

VADER
The plans you refer to will soon be
back in our hands.

MOTTI
Any attack made by the Rebels against
this station would be a useless
gesture, no matter what technical
data they've obtained. This station
is now the ultimate power in the
universe. I suggest we use it!

VADER
Don't be too proud of this
technological terror you've
constructed. The ability to destroy
a planet is insignificant next to
the power of the Force.

MOTTI
Don't try to frighten us with your
sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your
sad devotion to that ancient religion
has not helped you conjure up the
stolen data tapes, or given you
clairvoyance enough to find the
Rebel's hidden fort...

Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's
spell.

VADER
I find your lack of faith disturbing.

TARKIN
Enough of this! Vader, release him!

VADER
As you wish.

TARKIN
This bickering is pointless. Lord
Vader will provide us with the
location of the Rebel fortress by
the time this station is operational.
We will then crush the Rebellion
with one swift stroke.

EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas
Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble
and scattered bodies.

LUKE
It looks like Sandpeople did this,
all right. Look, here are Gaffi
sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...
I never heard of them hitting anything
this big before.

Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.

BEN
They didn't. But we are meant to
think they did. These tracks are
side by side. Sandpeople always ride
single file to hide there numbers.

LUKE
These are the same Jawas that sold
us Artoo and Threepio.

BEN
And these blast points, too accurate
for Sandpeople. Only Imperial
stormtroopers are so precise.

LUKE
Why would Imperial troops want to
slaughter Jawas?

Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are
inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.

LUKE
If they traced the robots here, they
may have learned who they sold them
to. And that would lead them home!

Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for
the speeder and jumps it.

BEN
Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous.

Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with the
burning Sandcrawler.

EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder.

EXT. TATOOINE - LARS HOMESTEAD

The speeder roars up to the burning homestead. Luke jumps
out and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home.
Debris is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great
battle has taken place.

LUKE
Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!

Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and uncle.
Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He is
stunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new
resolve comes over him.

EXT. SPACE

Imperial TIE fighter races toward the Death Star.

INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR

Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow
several Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia's face is
filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a
giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader.

VADER
And, now Your Highness, we will
discuss the location of your hidden
Rebel base.

The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it
approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical
arms bearing a large hypodermic needle. The door slides shut
and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. The muffled
screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard.

EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of
the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the
dead.  Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to
him.

BEN
There's nothing you could have done,
Luke, had you been there. You'd have
been killed, too, and the droids
would be in the hands of the Empire.

LUKE
I want to come with you to Alderaan.
There's nothing here for me now. I
want to learn the ways of the Force
and become a Jedi like my father.

EXT. TATOOINE - WASTELAND

The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it
zooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff
overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard
array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. A
harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts
his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where
Ben is standing.

BEN
Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never
find a more wretched hive of scum
and villainy. We must be cautious.

Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined
smile.

EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several combat-
hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A Trooper
questions Luke.

TROOPER
How long have you had these droids?

LUKE
About three or four seasons.

BEN
They're for sale if you want them.

TROOPER
Let me see your identification.

Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID while
Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.

BEN
You don't need to see his
identification.

TROOPER
We don't need to see his
identification.

BEN
These are not the droids your looking
for.

TROOPER
These are not the droids we're looking
for.

BEN
He can go about his business.

TROOPER
You can go about your business.

BEN
(to Luke)
Move along.

TROOPER
Move along. Move along.

EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina
on the outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange forms of
transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are
parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle
the speeder.

THREEPIO
I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting
creatures.

As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa
away.

LUKE
Go on, go on. I can't understand how
we got by those troopers. I thought
we were dead.

BEN
The Force can have a strong influence
on the weak-minded. You will find it
a powerful ally.

LUKE
Do you really think we're going to
find a pilot here that'll take us to
Alderaan?

BEN
Well, most of the best freighter
pilots can be found here. Only watch
your step. This place can be a little
rough.

LUKE
I'm ready for anything.

THREEPIO
Come along, Artoo.

INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA

The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow
Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy
den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic
alien creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At
first the sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy,
furry, scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over
drinks. Ben moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group
of repulsive but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender
stops Luke and the robots.

BARTENDER
We don't serve their kind here!

Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many
outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's
drift.

LUKE
What?

BARTENDER
Your droids. They'll have to wait
outside. We don't want them here.

Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the
Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures
along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.

Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.

LUKE
Listen, why don't you wait out by
the speeder. We don't want any
trouble.

THREEPIO
I heartily agree with you sir.

Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the
creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.

Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall savage-
looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey with
fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a fur-
covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.
Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers,
and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a
sight to behold.

Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times
during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets
out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit
disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between
Ben and the giant Wookiee.

Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips
his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear
or whatever.

A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.

CREATURE
Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?

The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore
the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby
Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the
belligerent monstrosity.

HUMAN
He doesn't like you.

LUKE
I'm sorry.

HUMAN
I don't like you either.

The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some
unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young
adventurer.

HUMAN
Don't insult us. You just watch
yourself. We're wanted men. I have
the death sentence in twelve systems.

LUKE
I'll be careful than.

HUMAN
You'll be dead.

The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar
moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His
three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind
Luke.

BEN
This little one isn't worth the
effort. Come let me buy you
something...

A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the young
would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through tables
and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking liquid.
With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a wicked
chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old Ben.
The bartender panics.

BARTENDER
No blasters! No blaster!

With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to life
and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is cut
in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled,
cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns
off his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt.
Luke, shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities,
attempts to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter
of seconds. The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is
given a respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing
his bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben
points the the Wookiee.

BEN
This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate
on a ship that might suit our needs.

EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on
an electronic conversation with another little red astro-
droid. A creature comes out of the cantina and approaches
two stormtroopers in the street.

THREEPIO
I don't like the look of this.

INT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - CANTINA

Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking
instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and
follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is
sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years
old. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental,
and cocksure.

HAN
Han Solo. I'm captain of the
Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells
me you're looking for passage to the
Alderaan system.

BEN
Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.

HAN
Fast ship? You've never heard of the
Millennium Falcon?

BEN
Should I have?

HAN
It's the ship that made the Kessel
run in less than twelve parsecs!

Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with
obvious misinformation.

HAN
I've outrun Imperial starships, not
the local bulk-cruisers, mind you.
I'm talking about the big Corellian
ships now. She's fast enough for
you, old man. What's the cargo?

BEN
Only passengers. Myself, the boy,
two droids, and no questions asked.

HAN
What is it? Some kind of local
trouble?

BEN
Let's just say we'd like to avoid
any Imperial entanglements.

HAN
Well, that's the trick, isn't it?
And it's going to cost you something
extra. Ten thousand in advance.

LUKE
Ten thousand? We could almost buy
our own ship for that!

HAN
But who's going to fly it, kid! You?

LUKE
You bet I could. I'm not such a bad
pilot myself! We don't have to sit
here and listen...

BEN
We haven't that much with us. But we
could pay you two thousand now, plus
fifteen when we reach Alderaan.

HAN
Seventeen, huh!

Han ponders this for a few moments.

HAN
Okay. You guys got yourself a ship.
We'll leave as soon as you're ready.
Docking bay Ninety-four.

BEN
Ninety-four.

HAN
Looks like somebody's beginning to
take an interest in your handiwork.

Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers
looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some
questions. The bartender points to the booth.

TROOPER
All right, we'll check it out.

The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben
are gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.

HAN
Seventeen thousand! Those guys must
really be desperate. This could really
save my neck. Get back to the ship
and get her ready.

EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

BEN
You'll have to sell your speeder.

LUKE
That's okay. I'm never coming back
to this planet again.

INT. MOS EISLEY - CANTINA

As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien
with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. The creature
speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles.

GREEDO
Going somewhere, Solo?

HAN
Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I
was just going to see your boss.
Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding the
gun on him.

GREEDO
It's too late. You should have paid
him when you had the chance. Jabba's
put a price on your head, so large
that every bounty hunter in the galaxy
will be looking for you. I'm lucky I
found you first.

HAN
Yeah, but this time I got the money.

GREEDO
If you give it to me, I might forget
I found you.

HAN
I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

GREEDO
Jabba's through with you. He has no
time for smugglers who drop their
shipments at the first sign of an
Imperial cruiser.

HAN
Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you
think I had a choice?

Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.

GREEDO
You can tell that to Jabba. He may
only take your ship.

HAN
Over my dead body.

GREEDO
That's the idea. I've been looking
forward to killing you for a long
time.

HAN
Yes, I'll bet you have.

Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of
light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as
the other patron look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up
and starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some
coins as he leaves.

HAN
Sorry about the mess.

EXT. SPACE

Several TIE fighters approach the Death Star.

INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

VADER
Her resistance to the mind probe is
considerable. It will be some time
before we can extract any information
from her.

An Imperial Officer interrupts the meeting.

IMPERIAL OFFICER
The final check-out is complete. All
systems are operational. What course
shall we set?

TARKIN
Perhaps she would respond to an
alternative form of persuasion.

VADER
What do you mean?

TARKIN
I think it is time we demonstrate
the full power of this station.
(to soldier)
Set your course for Princess Leia's
home planet of Alderaan.

TROOPER
With pleasure.

EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

Four heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a
narrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures hawking
exotic goods in the dingy little stalls. Men, monsters, and
robots crouch in the waste-filled doorways, whispering and
hiding from the hot winds.

THREEPIO
Lock the door, Artoo.

One of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves
on down the alleyway. The door slides open a crack and
Threepio peeks out. Artoo is barely visible in the background.

TROOPER
All right, check that side of the
street. It's secure. Move on to the
next door.

The door opens, Threepio moves into the doorway.

THREEPIO
I would much rather have gone with
Master Luke than stay here with you.
I don't know what all the trouble is
about, but I'm sure it must be your
fault.

Artoo makes beeping sounds.

THREEPIO
You watch your language!

EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET - ALLEYWAY - USED
SPEEDER LOT

Ben and Luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot,
talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder
dealer. Strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass
by as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some coins.

LUKE
He says it's the best he can do.
Since the XP-38 came out, they're
just not in demand.

BEN
It will be enough.

Ben and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty
alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like
creatures. Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his
faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. A darkly clad creature
moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as
they disappear down another alley.

BEN
If the ship's as fast as he's
boasting, we ought to do well.

INT. DOCKING BAY 94 - DAY

Jabba the Hut and a half-dozen grisly alien pirates and purple
creatures stand in the middle of the docking bay. Jabba is
the grossest of the slavering hulks and his scarred face is
a grim testimonial to his prowess as a vicious killer. He is
a fat, slug-like creature with eyes on extended feelers and
a huge ugly mouth.

JABBA
Come on out, Solo!

A voice from directly behind the pirates startles them and
they turn around to see Han Solo and the giant Wookiee,
Chewbacca, standing behind them with no weapons in sight.

HAN
I've been waiting for you, Jabba.

JABBA
I expected you would be.

HAN
I'm not the type to run.

JABBA
(fatherly-smooth)
Han, my boy, there are times when
you disappoint me... why haven't you
paid me? And why did you have to fry
poor Greedo like that... after all
we've been through together.

HAN
You sent Greedo to blast me.

JABBA
(mock surprise)
Han, why you're the best smuggler in
the business. You're too valuable to
fry. He was only relaying my concern
at your delays. He wasn't going to
blast you.

HAN
I think he thought he was. Next time
don't send one of those twerps. If
you've got something to say to me,
come see me yourself.

JABBA
Han, Han! If only you hadn't had to
dump that shipment of spice... you
understand I just can't make an
exception. Where would I be if every
pilot who smuggled for me dumped
their shipment at the first sign of
an Imperial starship? It's not good
business.

HAN
You know, even I get boarded
sometimes, Jabba. I had no choice,
but I've got a charter now and I can
pay you back, plus a little extra. I
just need some more time.

JABBA
(to his men)
Put your blasters away. Han, my boy,
I'm only doing this because you're
the best and I need you. So, for an
extra, say twenty percent I'll give
you a little more time... but this
is it. If you disappoint me again,
I'll put a price on your head so
large you won't be able to go near a
civilized system for the rest of
your short life.

HAN
Jabba, I'll pay you because it's my
pleasure.

EXT. DOCKING PORT ENTRY - ALLEYWAY

Chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay
94.  Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street.
Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry.
The darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder
lot.  He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small
transmitter.

INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94

Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is
Docking Bay 94. Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a
large, round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that
could only loosely be called a starship.

LUKE
What a piece of junk.

The tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp.

HAN
She'll make point five beyond the
speed of light. She may not look
like much, but she's got it where it
counts, kid. I've added some special
modifications myself.

Luke scratches his head. It's obvious he isn't sure about
all this. Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others
to follow.

HAN
We're a little rushed, so if you'll
hurry aboard we'll get out of here.

The group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han
Solo.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

Chewbacca settles into the pilot's chair and starts the mighty
engines of the starship.

INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94

Luke, Ben, Threepio, and Artoo move toward the Millennium
Falcon passing Solo.

THREEPIO
Hello, sir.

EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREET

Eight Imperial stormtroopers rush up to the darkly clad
creature.

TROOPER
Which way?

The darkly clad creature points to the door of the docking
bay.

TROOPER
All right, men. Load your weapons!

INT. MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT - DOCKING BAY 94 

The troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the
docking bay entrance.

TROOPER
Stop that ship!

Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers rushing
into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at Han as
he ducks into the spaceship.

TROOPER
Blast 'em!

Han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots
which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. The
pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that
slams the overhead entry shut.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

HAN
Chewie, get us out of here!

The group straps in for take off.

THREEPIO
Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I
hate space travel.

EXT. TATOOINE - MOS EISLEY - STREETS

The half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general
alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above
the dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the
morning sky.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han climbs into the pilot's chair next to Chewbacca, who
chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope.

EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE

The Corellian pirateship zooms from Tatooine into space.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han frantically types information into the ship's computer.
Little Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway,
makes a few beeping remarks, then scurries away.

HAN
It looks like an Imperial cruiser.
Our passengers must be hotter than I
thought. Try and hold them off. Angle
the deflector shield while I make
the calculations for the jump to
light speed.

EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE

The Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow
planet, Tatooine. It is followed by two huge Imperial
stardestroyers.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy
spread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the
cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.

HAN
Stay sharp! There are two more coming
in; they're going to try to cut us
off.

LUKE
Why don't you outrun them? I thought
you said this thing was fast.

HAN
Watch your mouth, kid, or you're
going to find yourself floating home.
We'll be safe enough once we make
the jump to hyperspace. Besides, I
know a few maneuvers. We'll lose
them!

EXT. SPACE - PLANET TATOOINE

Imperial cruisers fire at the pirateship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

The ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window.

HAN
Here's where the fun begins!

BEN
How long before you can make the
jump to light speed?

HAN
It'll take a few moments to get the
coordinates from the navi-computer.

The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.

LUKE
Are you kidding? At the rate they're
gaining...

HAN
Traveling through hyperspace isn't
like dusting crops, boy! Without
precise calculations we could fly
right through a star or bounce too
close to a supernova and that'd end
your trip real quick, wouldn't it?

The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red
warning light begins to flash.

LUKE
What's that flashing?

HAN
We're losing our deflector shield.
Go strap yourself in, I'm going to
make the jump to light speed.

The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if
crashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship
makes the jump to hyperspace.

Alderaan looms behind the Death Star battlestation.

INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before
Governor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen
displaying a small green planet.

MOTTI
We've entered the Alderaan system.

Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her
hands are bound.

LEIA
Governor Tarkin, I should have
expected to find you holding Vader's
leash. I recognized your foul stench
when I was brought on board.

TARKIN
Charming to the last. You don't know
how hard I found it signing the order
to terminate your life!

LEIA
I surprised you had the courage to
take the responsibility yourself!

TARKIN
Princess Leia, before your execution
I would like you to be my guest at a
ceremony that will make this battle
station operational. No star system
will dare oppose the Emperor now.

LEIA
The more you tighten your grip,
Tarkin, the more star systems will
slip through your fingers.

TARKIN
Not after we demonstrate the power
of this station. In a way, you have
determined the choice of the planet
that'll be destroyed first. Since
you are reluctant to provide us with
the location of the Rebel base, I
have chosen to test this station's
destructive power... on your home
planet of Alderaan.

LEIA
No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no
weapons. You can't possibly...

TARKIN
You would prefer another target? A
military target? Then name the system!

Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.

TARKIN
I grow tired of asking this. So it'll
be the last time. Where is the Rebel
base?

Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to
Alderaan.

LEIA
(softly)
Dantooine.

Leia lowers her head.

LEIA
They're on Dantooine.

TARKIN
There. You see Lord Vader, she can
be reasonable.
(addressing Motti)
Continue with the operation. You may
fire when ready.

LEIA
What?

TARKIN
You're far too trusting. Dantooine
is too remote to make an effective
demonstration. But don't worry. We
will deal with your Rebel friends
soon enough.

LEIA
No!

INT. DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER

VADER
Commence primary ignition.

A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A
hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever.
Another lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another
lever and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A
huge beam of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area
and converges into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan.
The small green planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small "seeker"
robot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters,
seems almost faint.

LUKE
Are you all right? What's wrong?

BEN
I felt a great disturbance in the
Force... as if millions of voices
suddenly cried out in terror and
were suddenly silenced. I fear
something terrible has happened.

Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then
he fixes his gaze on Luke.

BEN
You'd better get on with your
exercises.

Han Solo enters the room.

HAN
Well, you can forget your troubles
with those Imperial slugs. I told
you I'd outrun 'em.

Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.

HAN
Don't everyone thank me at once.

Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a
game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move
along a chess-type board.

HAN
Anyway, we should be at Alderaan
about oh-two-hundred hours.

Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table
covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the
table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca
seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur-
covered arms over his head.

THREEPIO
Now be careful, Artoo.

Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his
stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures
to walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's
face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot.
Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and
begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.

THREEPIO
He made a fair move. Screaming about
it won't help you.

HAN
(interrupting)
Let him have it. It's not wise to
upset a Wookiee.

THREEPIO
But sir, nobody worries about
upsetting a droid.

HAN
That's 'cause droids don't pull
people's arms out of their socket
when they lose. Wookiees are known
to do that.

THREEPIO
I see your point, sir. I suggest a
new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee
win.

Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems
frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his
head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.
Han watches with a bit of smugness.

BEN
Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force
flowing through him.

LUKE
You mean it controls your actions?

BEN
Partially. But it also obeys your
commands.

Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a
"seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae,
hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of
the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift
lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't
move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy,
then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood
red laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing
him to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.

HAN
Hokey religions and ancient weapons
are no match for a good blaster at
your side, kid.

LUKE
You don't believe in the Force, do
you?

HAN
Kid, I've flown from one side of
this galaxy to the other. I've seen
a lot of strange stuff, but I've
never seen anything to make me believe
there's one all-powerful force
controlling everything. There's no
mystical energy field that controls
my destiny.

Ben smiles quietly.

HAN
It's all a lot of simple tricks and
nonsense.

BEN
I suggest you try it again, Luke.

Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his
eyes.

BEN
This time, let go your conscious
self and act on instinct.

LUKE
(laughing)
With the blast shield down, I can't
even see. How am I supposed to fight?

BEN
Your eyes can deceive you. Don't
trust them.

Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker
into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then
drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly
missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits
Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful
yell and attempts to hit the seeker.

BEN
Stretch out with your feelings.

Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker makes
a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect the
bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original
position.

BEN
You see, you can do it.

HAN
I call it luck.

BEN
In my experience, there's no such
thing as luck.

HAN
Look, going good against remotes is
one thing. Going good against the
living? That's something else.

Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the
control panel.

HAN
Looks like we're coming up on
Alderaan.

Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.

LUKE
You know, I did feel something. I
could almost see the remote.

BEN
That's good. You have taken your
first step into a larger world.

INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM

Imperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the
evil Dark Lord Darth Vader.

TARKIN
Yes.

OFFICER CASS
Our scout ships have reached
Dantooine. They found the remains of
a Rebel base, but they estimate that
it has been deserted for some time.
They are now conducting an extensive
search of the surrounding systems.

TARKIN
She lied! She lied to us!

VADER
I told you she would never consciously
betray the Rebellion.

TARKIN
Terminate her... immediately!

EXT. HYPERSPACE

The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange
surreal light show surrounds the ship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

HAN
Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in
the sublight engines.

Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit window
stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed, then
stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and violently
shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them, battering
the sides of the ship.

HAN
What the...? Aw, we've come out of
hyperspace into a meteor shower.
Some kind of asteroid collision.
It's not on any of the charts.

The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool
in the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing
cockpit.

LUKE
What's going on?

HAN
Our position is correct, except...
no, Alderaan!

LUKE
What do you mean? Where is it?

HAN
Thats what I'm trying to tell you,
kid. It ain't there. It's been totally
blown away.

LUKE
What? How?

Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins to
settle down.

BEN
Destroyed... by the Empire!

HAN
The entire starfleet couldn't destroy
the whole planet. It'd take a thousand
ships with more fire power than
I've...

A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled
alarm starts humming.

HAN
There's another ship coming in.

LUKE
Maybe they know what happened.

BEN
It's an Imperial fighter.

Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts outside
the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A tiny, finned
Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit window.

LUKE
It followed us!

BEN
No. It's a short range fighter.

HAN
There aren't any bases around here.
Where did it come from?

EXT. SPACE

The fighter races past the Corellian pirateship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

LUKE
It sure is leaving in a big hurry.
If they identify us, we're in big
trouble.

HAN
Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam
it's transmissions.

BEN
It'd be as well to let it go. It's
too far out of range.

HAN
Not for long...

EXT. SPACE

The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the
vastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny
fighter. In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter
until it is obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Ben
stands behind Chewbacca.

BEN
A fighter that size couldn't get
this deep into space on its own.

LUKE
It must have gotten lost, been part
of a convoy or something.

HAN
Well, he ain't going to be around
long enough to tell anyone about us.

EXT. SPACE

The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as
they race toward camera and disappear over head.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or
planet.

LUKE
Look at him. He's headed for that
small moon.

HAN
I think I can get him before he gets
there... he's almost in range.

The small moon begins to take on the appearance of a monstrous
spherical battle station.

BEN
That's no moon! It's a space station.

HAN
It's too big to be a space station.

LUKE
I have a very bad feeling about this.

HAN
Yeah, I think your right. Full
reverse! Chewie, lock in the auxiliary
power.

The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates away
toward the gargantuan battle station.

LUKE
Why are we still moving towards it?

HAN
We're caught in a tractor beam! It's
pulling us in!

LUKE
But there's gotta be something you
can do!

HAN
There's nothin' I can do about it,
kid. I'm in full power. I'm going to
have to shut down. But they're not
going to get me without a fight!

Ben Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder.

BEN
You can't win. But there are
alternatives to fighting.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DEATH STAR

As the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome
metal moon, the immense size of the massive battle station
becomes staggering. Running along the equator of the gigantic
sphere is a mile-high band of huge docking ports into which
the helpless pirateship is dragged.

EXT. DEATH STAR - HUGE PORT DOORS

The helpless Millennium Falcon is pulled past a docking port
control room and huge laser turret cannons.

VOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM

Clear Bay twenty-three-seven. We are opening the magnetic
field.

INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY 2037

The pirateship is pulled in through port doors of the Death
Star, coming to rest in a huge hangar. Thirty stormtroopers
stand at attention in a central assembly area.

OFFICER
To you stations!
(to another officer)
Come with me.

INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

Stormtroopers run to their posts.

INT. DEATH STAR - HANGAR 2037

A line of stormtroopers march toward the pirateship in
readiness to board it, while other troopers stand with weapons
ready to fire.

OFFICER
Close all outboard shields! Close
all outboard shields!

INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM

Tarkin pushes a button and responds to the intercom buzz.

TARKIN
Yes.

VOICE
(over intercom)
We've captured a freighter entering
the remains of the Alderaan system.
It's markings match those of a ship
that blasted its way out of Mos
Eisley.

VADER
They must be trying to return the
stolen plans to the princess. She
may yet be of some use to us.

INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY 2037

Vader and a commander approach the troops as an Officer and
several heavily armed troops exit the spacecraft.

VOICE
(over intercom)
Unlock one-five-seven and nine.
Release charges.

OFFICER
(to Vader)
There's no one on board, sir.
According to the log, the crew
abandoned ship right after takeoff.
It must be a decoy, sir. Several of
the escape pods have been jettisoned.

VADER
Did you find any droids?

OFFICER
No, sir. If there were any on board,
they must also have jettisoned.

VADER
Send a scanning crew on board. I
want every part of this ship checked.

OFFICER
Yes, sir.

VADER
I sense something... a presence I
haven't felt since...

Vader turns quickly and exits the hangar.

OFFICER
Get me a scanning crew in here on
the double. I want every part of
this ship checked!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HALLWAY

A trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. In
a few moments all is quiet. The muffled sounds of a distant
officer giving orders finally fade. Two floor panels suddenly
pop up revealing Han Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobi sticks his
head out of a third locker.

LUKE
Boy, it's lucky you had these
compartments.

HAN
I use them for smuggling. I never
thought I'd be smuggling myself in
them. This is ridiculous. Even if I
could take off, I'd never get past
the tractor beam.

BEN
Leave that to me!

HAN
Damn fool. I knew that you were going
to say that!

BEN
Who's the more foolish... the fool
or the fool who follows him?

Han shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca agrees.

INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the
two stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.

TROOPER
The ship's all yours. If the scanners
pick up anything, report it
immediately. All right, let's go.

The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound
is followed by a voice calling to the guard below.

HAN'S VOICE
Hey down there, could you give us a
hand with this?

The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of gunfire
is heard.

INT. DEATH STAR - FORWARD BAY - COMMAND OFFICE

In a very small command office near the entrance to the
pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices
the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.

GANTRY OFFICER
TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at
your post? TX-four-one-two, do you
copy?

A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and
waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating
his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his
head in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an
annoyed look.

GANTRY OFFICER
Take over. We've got a bad
transmitter. I'll see what I can do.

As the officer approaches the door, it slides open revealing
the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a momentary
state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone- chilling
howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one blow.
The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is blasted
by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and the
robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also dressed
as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.

LUKE
You know, between his howling and
your blasting everything in sight,
it's a wonder the whole station
doesn't know we're here.

HAN
Bring them on! I prefer a straight
fight to all this sneaking around.

THREEPIO
We found the computer outlet, sir.

Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of
the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it
carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.
Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.

BEN
Plug in. He should be able to
interpret the entire Imperial computer
network.

Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the
vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information
to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.

THREEPIO
He says he's found the main computer
to power the tractor beam that's
holding the ship here. He'll try to
make the precise location appear on
the monitor.

The computer monitor flashes readouts.

THREEPIO
The tractor beam is coupled to the
main reactor in seven locations. A
power loss at one of the terminals
will allow the ship to leave.

Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.

BEN
I don't think you boys can help. I
must go alone.

HAN
Whatever you say. I've done more
that I bargained for on this trip
already.

LUKE
I want to go with you.

BEN
Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch
over the droids.

LUKE
But he can...

BEN
They must be delivered safely or
other star systems will suffer the
same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny
lies along a different path than
mine. The Force will be with you...
always!

Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps
out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey
hallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head
in agreement.

HAN
Boy you said it, Chewie.

Han looks at Luke.

HAN
Where did you dig up that old fossil?

LUKE
Ben is a great man.

HAN
Yeah, great at getting us into
trouble.

LUKE
I didn't hear you give any ideas...

HAN
Well, anything would be better than
just hanging around waiting for him
to pick us up...

LUKE
Who do you think...

Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.
Luke goes over to him.

LUKE
What is it?

THREEPIO
I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.
He says "I found her", and keeps
repeating, "She's here."

LUKE
Well, who... who has he found?

Artoo whistles a frantic reply.

THREEPIO
Princess Leia.

LUKE
The princess? She's here?

HAN
Princess? What's going on?

THREEPIO
Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-
three. I'm afraid she's scheduled to
be terminated.

LUKE
Oh, no! We've got to do something.

HAN
What are you talking about?

LUKE
The droid belongs to her. She's the
one in the message... We've got to
help her.

HAN
Now, look, don't get any funny ideas.
The old man wants us to wait right
here.

LUKE
But he didn't know she was here.
Look, will you just find a way back
into the detention block?

HAN
I'm not going anywhere.

LUKE
They're going to execute her. Look,
a few minutes ago you said you didn't
want to just wait here to be captured.
Now all you want to do is stay.

HAN
Marching into the detention area is
not what I had in mind.

LUKE
But they're going to kill her!

HAN
Better her than me...

LUKE
She's rich.

Chewbacca growls.

HAN
Rich?

LUKE
Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you
were to rescue her, the reward would
be...

HAN
What?

LUKE
Well more wealth that you can imagine.

HAN
I don't know, I can imagine quite a
bit!

LUKE
You'll get it!

HAN
I better!

LUKE
You will...

HAN
All right, kid. But you'd better be
right about this.

Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.

LUKE
All right.

HAN
What's your plan?

LUKE
Uh... Threepio, hand me those binders
there will you?

Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.

LUKE
Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on
you.

Chewie lets out a hideous growl.

LUKE
Okay. Han, you put these on.

Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.

HAN
Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know
what he has in mind.

The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face as
Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.

THREEPIO
Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for
asking... but, ah... what should
Artoo and I do if we're discovered
here?

LUKE
Lock the door!

HAN
And hope they don't have blasters.

THREEPIO
That isn't very reassuring.

Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and
start off into the giant Imperial Death Star.

INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - ELEVATOR TUBE

Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits
as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops,
bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio
completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious
glance.

Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.

LUKE
I can't see a thing in this helmet.

A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away
by Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and
the elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.

INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN HALLWAY

Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main
passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot
similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end
of the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then
disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting
that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion.
No one in the hallway seems to notice him.

INT. DEATH STAR - INTERIOR ELEVATOR - DETENTION SECURITY
AREA

Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door
slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards
enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates
are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.

HAN
This is not going to work.

LUKE
Why didn't you say so before?

HAN
I did say so before!

INT. DETENTION AREA

Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches
the trio.

OFFICER
Where are you taking this... thing?

Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to shut
up.

LUKE
Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-
three-eight.

OFFICER
I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear
it.

The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in
the information. There are only three other troopers in the
area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the
alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of
Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.

Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with one
of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.

HAN
Look out! He's loose!

LUKE
He's going to pull us all apart.

HAN
Go get him!

The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and
Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are
blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of
laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser
gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the
last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is
about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink
system, which is screeching questions about what is going
on.  He quickly checks the computer readout.

HAN
We've got to find out which cell
this princess of yours is in. Here
it is... cell twenty-one-eight-seven.
You go get her. I'll hold them here.

Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into
the buzzing comlink.

HAN
(sounding official)
Everything is under control. Situation
normal.

INTERCOM VOICE
What happened?

HAN
(getting nervous)
Uh... had a slight weapons
malfunction. But, uh, everything's
perfectly all right now. We're fine.
We're all fine here, now, thank you.
How are you?

INTERCOM VOICE
We're sending a squad up.

HAN
Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor
leak here now. Give us a few minutes
to lock it down. Large leak... very
dangerous.

INTERCOM VOICE
Who is this? What's your operating
number?

Han blasts the comlink and it explodes.

HAN
Boring conversation anyway.
(yelling down the
hall)
Luke! We're going to have company!

INT. DEATH STAR - CELL ROW

Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door
away with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees
the dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping
and is now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on
her face. Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands
staring at her with his mouth hanging open.

LEIA
(finally)
Aren't you a little short to be a
stormtrooper?

Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.

LUKE
What? Oh... the uniform. I'm Luke
Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.

LEIA
You're who?

LUKE
I'm here to rescue you. I've got
your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben
Kenobi.

LEIA
Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?

LUKE
Come on!

INT. DEATH STAR - CONFERENCE ROOM

Darth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the
far end of the conference table.

VADER
He is here...

TARKIN
Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think
so?

VADER
A tremor in the Force. The last time
I felt it was in the presence of my
old master.

TARKIN
Surely he must be dead by now.

VADER
Don't underestimate the power of the
Force.

TARKIN
The Jedi are extinct, their fire has
gone out of the universe. You, my
friend, are all that's left of their
religion.

There is a quiet buzz on the comlink.

TARKIN
Yes.

INTERCOM VOICE
Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency
alert in detention block A A-twenty-
three.

TARKIN
The princess! Put all sections on
alert!

VADER
Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with
him.

TARKIN
If you're right, he must not be
allowed to escape.

VADER
Escape is not his plan. I must face
him alone.

INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION AREA - HALLWAY

An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the
elevator door.

HAN
Chewie!

Chewbacca responds with a growling noise.

HAN
Get behind me! Get behind me!

A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door
through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.

Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke
and flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting
up with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.

HAN
Can't get out that way.

LEIA
Looks like you managed to cut off
our only escape route.

HAN
(sarcastically)
Maybe you'd like it back in your
cell, Your Highness.

Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as they
continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their
way down the corridor.

LUKE
See-Threepio! See-Threepio!

THREEPIO
(over comlink)
Yes sir?

LUKE
We've been cut off! Are there any
other ways out of the cell bay?...
What was that? I didn't copy!

INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN BAY GANTRY - CONTROL TOWER

Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and
whistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the small comlink
transmitter.

THREEPIO
I said, all systems have been alerted
to your presence, sir. The main
entrance seems to be the only way in
or out; all other information on
your level is restricted.

Someone begins banging on the door.

TROOPER VOICE
Open up in there!

THREEPIO
Oh, no!

INT. DEATH STAR - DETENTION CORRIDOR

Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as
they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca
are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far
and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke
fills the narrow cell corridor.

LUKE
There isn't any other way out.

HAN
I can't hold them off forever! Now
what?

LEIA
This is some rescue. When you came
in here, didn't you have a plan for
getting out?

HAN
(pointing to Luke)
He's the brains, sweetheart.

Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.

LUKE
Well, I didn't...

The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in
the wall next to Han, almost frying him.

HAN
What the hell are you doing?

LEIA
Somebody has to save our skins. Into
the garbage chute, wise guy.

She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca
look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and
says something.

HAN
Get in there you big furry oaf! I
don't care what you smell! Get in
there and don't worry about it.

Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the
tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their
way toward the opening.

HAN
Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to
kill her or I'm beginning to like
her. Get in there!

Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han fires
off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then
slides into the chute himself and is gone.

INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.
Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He
finds a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't
budge.

HAN
(sarcastically)
Oh! The garbage chute was a really
wonderful idea. What an incredible
smell you've discovered! Let's get
out of here! Get away from there...

LUKE
No! wait!

Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The
laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.
Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes
almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a
rather grim look on her face.

LUKE
Will you forget it? I already tried
it. It's magnetically sealed!

LEIA
Put that thing away! You're going to
get us all killed.

HAN
Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I
had everything under control until
you led us down here. You know, it's
not going to take them long to figure
out what happened to us.

LEIA
It could be worse...

A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the
murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins
to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols
drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.

HAN
It's worse.

LUKE
There's something alive in here!

HAN
That's your imagination.

LUKE
Something just moves past my leg!
Look! Did you see that?

HAN
What?

LUKE
Help!

Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.

HAN
Luke! Luke! Luke!

Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air
and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around
his throat.

LEIA
Luke!

Leia extends a long pipe toward him.

LEIA
Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.

LUKE
Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.

HAN
Where?

LUKE
Anywhere! Oh!!

Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the
muck by the slimy tentacle.

HAN
Luke! Luke!

Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and
move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet.
Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca
howls in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke
suddenly bobs to the surface.

LEIA
Grab him!

Luke seems to be released by the thing.

LEIA
What happened?

LUKE
I don't know, it just let go of me
and disappeared...

HAN
I've got a very bad feeling about
this.

Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble and
edge toward the Rebels.

LUKE
The walls are moving!

LEIA
Don't just stand there. Try to brace
it with something.

They place poles and long metal beams between the closing
walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant
trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good.

LUKE
Wait a minute!

Luke pulls out his comlink.

LUKE
Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio!
Where could he be?

INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN GANTRY - COMMAND OFFICE

A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for
See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which
is sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and
Threepio are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great
explosion and the door of the control tower flies across the
floor. Four armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.

FIRST TROOPER
Take over!
(pointing to the dead
officer)
See to him! Look there!

A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door slides
open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo follows
his bronze companion out into the office.

THREEPIO
They're madmen! They're heading for
the prison level. If you hurry, you
might catch them.

FIRST OFFICER
(to his troops)
Follow me! You stand guard.

The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to
watch over the command office.

THREEPIO
(to Artoo)
Come on!

The guard aims a blaster at them.

THREEPIO
Oh! All this excitement has overrun
the circuits of my counterpart here.
If you don't mind, I'd like to take
him down to maintenance.

TROOPER
All right.

The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow, hurries
out the door.

INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller.
Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his
giant paws.

Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is
snapping and popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.

LUKE
Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!

Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a pole.
Leia begins to sink into the trash.

HAN
Get to the top!

LEIA
I can't

LUKE
Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio,
will you come in?

INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

THREEPIO
They aren't here! Something must
have happened to them. See if they've
been captured.

Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall
socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from
the tiny robot.

THREEPIO
Hurry!

INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

The walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against
the walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each
other. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds
it tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels
the first crushing pressure against her body.

HAN
One thing's for sure. We're all going
to be a lot thinner!
(to Leia)
Get on top of it!

LEIA
I'm trying!

INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

THREEPIO
(to Artoo)
Thank goodness, they haven't found
them! Where could they be?

Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.

THREEPIO
Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I
turned it off!

INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his
head above the rising ooze. Luke's comlink begins to buzz
and he rips it off his belt.

INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

Muffled sounds of Luke's voice over the comlink can be heard,
but not distinctly.

THREEPIO
Are you there, sir?

INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

LUKE
Threepio!

INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

THREEPIO
We've had some problems...

LUKE
(over comlink)
Will you shut up and listen to me?
Shut down all garbage mashers on the
detention level, will you? Do you
copy?

INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

LUKE
Shut down all the garbage mashers on
the detention level.

INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

LUKE
(over comlink)
Shut down all the garbage mashers on
the detention level.

THREEPIO
(to Artoo)
No. Shut them all down! Hurry!

Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible
screaming and hollering from Luke's comlink.

THREEPIO
Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo!
Curse my metal body! I wasn't fast
enough. It's all my fault! My poor
master!

LUKE
(over comlink)
Threepio, we're all right!

INT. DEATH STAR - GARBAGE ROOM

The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief.
The walls have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace
in the background.

LUKE
We're all right. You did great.

Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a
number.

LUKE
Hey... hey, open the pressure
maintenance hatch on unit number...
where are we?

INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY - SERVICE PANEL

HAN
(over comlink)
Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.

INT. DEATH STAR - TRACTOR BEAM - POWER GENERATOR TRENCH

Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge
tractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep.
The clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard.
The old Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading
to a control panel that connects two large cables. He
carefully makes several adjustments in the computer terminal,
and several lights on the board go from red to blue.

INT. DEATH STAR - UNUSED HALLWAY

The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway.
Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster
belts.

HAN
If we can just avoid any more female
advice, we ought to be able to get
out of here.

Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster
from Solo.

LUKE
Well, let's get moving!

Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the garbage
room, as he runs away and then stops howling.

HAN
(to Chewie)
Where are you going?

The Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy
tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a
victim. Han aims his pistol.

LEIA
No, wait. They'll hear!

Han fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes
relentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply
shakes his head in disgust.

HAN
(to Chewie)
Come here, you big coward!

Chewie shakes his head "no."

HAN
Chewie! Come here!

LEIA
Listen. I don't know who you are, or
where you came from, but from now
on, you do as I tell you. Okay?

Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.

HAN
Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get
one thing straight! I take orders
from one person! Me!

LEIA
It's a wonder you're still alive.
(looking at Chewie)
Will somebody get this big walking
carpet out of my way?

Han watches her start away. He looks at Luke.

HAN
No reward is worth this.

They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor.

INT. DEATH STAR - POWER TRENCH

Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of
stormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly
slips into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few
feet of him.

OFFICER
Secure this area until the alert is
canceled.

FIRST TROOPER
Give me regular reports.

All but two of the stormtroopers leave.

FIRST TROOPER
Do you know what's going on?

SECOND TROOPER
Maybe it's another drill.

Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the stormtroopers
as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures with his hand
toward them, as the troops think they hear something in the
other hallway. With the help of the Force, Ben deftly slips
past the troopers and into the main hallway.

SECOND TROOPER
What was that?

FIRST TROOPER
Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about
it.

INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and
stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers
are milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.

HAN
(looking at his ship)
There she is.

LUKE
See-Threepio, do you copy?

THREEPIO
(voice)
For the moment. Uh, we're in the
main hangar across from the ship.

LUKE
We're right above you. Stand by.

Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of
the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and
points out the window to the ship.

LEIA
You came in that thing? You're braver
that I thought.

HAN
Nice! Come on!

Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the
hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty
Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are
taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.

FIRST TROOPER
It's them! Blast them!

Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and charges
the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the
stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down
the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.

HAN
(to Luke and Leia)
Get back to the ship!

LUKE
Where are you going? Come back!

Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.

LEIA
He certainly has courage.

LUKE
What good will it do us if he gets
himself killed? Come on!

Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for
muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke
and Leia start off toward the starship hangar.

INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is
yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a
dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few
feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops
begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are
moving into an attack position in front of the lone
starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops
begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.

INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt
to save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of
laser guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate
extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of
furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running
the other way also.

INT. DEATH STAR - SUBHALLWAY

Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down
a narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They
quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an
open hatchway.

INT. DEATH STAR - CENTRAL CORE SHAFT

Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge
that spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity.
The bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft,
and Luke almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance
off the end of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of
his arm and pulls him back.

LUKE
(gasping)
I think we took a wrong turn.

Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby
reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at
the advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch
that pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving
them precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.
Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.

LEIA
There's no lock!

Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.

LUKE
That oughta hold it for a while.

LEIA
Quick, we've got to get across. Find
the control that extends the bridge.

LUKE
Oh, I think I just blasted it.

Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the
stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making
ominous drilling and pounding sounds.

LEIA
They're coming through!

Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when
laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol
at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across
the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops
appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit,
and grabs at his chest.

Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by
Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move
back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.

LUKE
Here, hold this.

Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility belt.
It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a bridge
overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with the
rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper appears
and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.
Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet
of more troops.

LEIA
Here they come!

Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and
he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the
gorge and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He
tugs on the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the
princess in his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him
quickly on the lips. Luke is very surprised.

LEIA
For luck!

Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss
to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as
Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the
stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at
the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into
the tiny subhallway.

INT. DEATH STAR - NARROW PASSAGEWAY

Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several
stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks
to make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the
opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of
the hallway and starts after the old Jedi.

INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the
pirateship entry ramp.

THREEPIO
Where could they be?

Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome left
and right, beeping a response.

INT. DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR - BLAST SHIELDS DOOR

Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several
troopers hot on their trail.

TROOPER
Close the blast doors!

At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in
front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion
race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage
to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops
before the doors slam shut.

TROOPER
Open the blast doors! Open the blast
doors!

INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY

Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar
where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar,
Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not
ten feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his
and steps slowly forward.

VADER
I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
We meet again, at last. The circle
is now complete.

Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical offensive
position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive stance.

VADER
When I left you, I was but the
learner; now I am the master.

BEN
Only a master of evil, Darth.

The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few
moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right
moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain,
as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He
shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes.

Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked
by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke
by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's
blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark
Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar.
The two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments
with laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing
sound.

VADER
Your powers are weak, old man.

BEN
You can't win, Darth. If you strike
me down, I shall become more powerful
than you can possibly imagine.

Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat.

INT. DEATH STAR - MAIN FORWARD BAY

Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back
against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the
Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.

HAN
Didn't we just leave this party?

Chewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join them.

HAN
What kept you?

LEIA
We ran into some old friends.

LUKE
Is the ship all right?

HAN
Seems okay, if we can get to it.
Just hope the old man got the tractor
beam out of commission.

INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they
hit their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact.
Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord
of The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his
group's vantage point.

LUKE
Look!

Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader
emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking
bay.

INT. DEATH STAR - DOCKING BAY

Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's
Imperial docking bay.

THREEPIO
Come on, Artoo, we're going!

Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who
were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards
Ben and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo.

INT. DEATH STAR - HALLWAY

Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The
troops rush toward the battling knights.

HAN
Now's our chance! Go!

They start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops
charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader
takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings
his mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to
deflect the blow and swiftly turns around.

The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts
his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene
look on his face.

Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's
cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.
Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the
empty cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers
and the robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two
and starts for him. Aghast, he yells out.

LUKE
No!

The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.
The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium
Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns
their fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and
advances toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.

HAN
(to Luke)
Come on!

LEIA
Come on! Luke, its too late!

HAN
Blast the door! Kid!

Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it
explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge
forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close
behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the
docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his
onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops,
as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He
fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.

BEN'S VOICE
Run, Luke! Run!

Luke looks around to see where the voice came from. He turns
toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the
troopers and races into the ship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move.
The dull thud of laser bolts bouncing off the outside of the
ship as Chewie adjusts his controls.

HAN
I hope the old man got that tractor
beam out if commission, or this is
going to be a real short trip. Okay,
hit it!

Chewbacca growls in agreement.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

The Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking
bay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness
of space.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

Luke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off
blankly as the robots look on. Leia puts a blanket around
him protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her. She
sits down beside him.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Solo spots approaching enemy ships.

HAN
(to Chewie)
We're coming up on the sentry ships.
Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector
shields while I charge up the main
guns!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CENTRAL HOLD AREA

Luke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth,
as the princess smiles comfortingly at him.

LUKE
I can't believe he's gone.

Artoo-Detoo beeps a reply.

LEIA
There wasn't anything you could have
done.

Han rushes into the hold area where Luke is sitting with the
princess.

HAN
(to Luke)
Come on, buddy, we're not out of
this yet!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS - COCKPIT

Solo climbs into his attack position in the topside gunport.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD AREA

Luke gets up and moves out toward the gunports as Leia heads
for the cockpit.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS - COCKPIT

Luke climbs down the ladder into the gunport cockpit, settling
into one of the two main laser cannons mounted in large
rotating turrets on either side of the ship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SOLO'S GUNPORT

Han adjusts his headset as he sits before the controls of
his laser cannon, then speaks into the attached microphone.

HAN
(to Luke)
You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS - COCKPIT

Chewbacca and Princess Leia search the heavens for attacking
TIE fighters. The Wookiee pulls back on the speed controls

fill of small computer chips.

THREEPIO
Oooh!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - GUNPORTS

Leia watches the computer readout as Chewbacca manipulates
the ship's controls.

LEIA
We've lost lateral controls.

HAN
Don't worry, she'll hold together.

An enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship's control panel,
causing it to blow out in a shower of sparks.

HAN
(to ship)
You hear me, baby? Hold together!

Artoo-Detoo advances toward the smoking sparking control
panel, dousing the inferno by spraying it with fire retardant
beeping all the while.

HAN
Great kid! Don't get cocky.

Han turns back to his laser cannon.

there!

EXT. SPACE

A TIE fighter moves up over the pirateship, firing laserblasts
at it.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

Luke and Han look into their respective projected target
screens. An Imperial fighter crosses Solo's port, and Han
swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser
cannon. Another fighter crosses Luke's port, and he reacts
in a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his
face.

EXT. SPACE

The TIE fighter zooms toward the pirateship, firing
destructive blasts at it.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORTS

firing upon the Falcon.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNPORT

Solo swivels behind his cannon, his aim describing the arc
of the TIE fighter. The fighter comes closer, firing at the
pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo's laser cannon
hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower
of burning fragments.

LUKE
(laughing)
That's it! We did it!

The princess jumps up and gives Chewie a congratulatory hug.

LEIA
We did it!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - PASSAGEWAY

Threepio lies on the floor of the ship, completely tangled
in the smoking, sparking wires.

THREEPIO
Help! I think I'm melting!
(to Artoo)
This is all your fault.

Artoo turns his dome from side to side, beeping in response.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

The victorious Millennium Falcon moves off majestically
through space.

INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

Darth Vader strides into the control room, where Tarkin is
watching the huge view screen. A sea of stars is before him.

TARKIN
Are they away?

VADER
They have just made the jump into
hyperspace.

TARKIN
You're sure the homing beacon is
secure aboard their ship? I'm taking
an awful risk, Vader. This had better
work.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han, removes his gloves and smiling, is at the controls of
the ship. Chewie moves into the aft section to check the
damage. Leia is seated near Han.

HAN
Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You
know, sometimes I even amaze myself.

LEIA
That doesn't sound too hard. Besides,
they let us go. It's the only
explanation for the ease of our
escape.

HAN
Easy... you call that easy?

LEIA
Their tracking us!

HAN
Not this ship, sister.

Frustrated, Leia shakes her head.

LEIA
At least the information in Artoo is
still intact.

HAN
What's so important? What's he
carrying?

LEIA
The technical readouts of that battle
station. I only hope that when the
data is analyzed, a weakness can be
found. It's not over yet!

HAN
It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't
in this for your revolution, and I'm
not in it for you, Princess. I expect
to be well paid. I'm in it for the
money!

LEIA
You needn't worry about your reward.
If money is all that you love, then
that's what you'll receive!

She angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit,
passes Luke coming in.

LEIA
Your friend is quite a mercenary. I
wonder if he really cares about
anything... or anyone.

LUKE
I care!

Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and Han
stare out at the vast blackness of space.

LUKE
So... what do you think of her, Han?

HAN
I'm trying not to, kid!

LUKE
(under his breath)
Good...

HAN
Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I
don't know, what do you think? Do
you think a princess and a guy like
me...

LUKE
No!

Luke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at
young Luke's jealousy.

EXT. SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN

The battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet
Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons.

EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST

An alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the countryside.
He sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely
visible in the foliage.

EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE TEMPLE

Rotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple
lies shrouded in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the
fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures. Han, Luke and the
others are greeted by the Rebel troops.

Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an armored
military speeder.

INT. MASSASSI - MAIN HANGAR DECK

The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set
up in the interior of the crumbling temple. Willard, the
commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and
gives Leia a big hug. Every one is pleased to see her.

WILLARD
(holding Leia)
You're safe! We had feared the worst.

Willard composes himself, steps back and bows formally.

WILLARD
When we heard about Alderaan, we
were afraid that you were... lost
along with your father.

LEIA
We don't have time for our sorrows,
Commander. The battle station has
surely tracked us here.
(looking pointedly to
Han)
It's the only explanation for the
ease of our escape. You must use the
information in this R2 unit to plan
the attack. It is our only hope.

EXT. SPACE

The surface of the Death Star ominously approaches the red
planet Yavin.

INT. DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

Grand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader are interrupted in their
discussion by the buzz of the comlink. Tarkin moves to answer
the call.

TARKIN
Yes.

DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE

We are approaching the planet Yavin. The Rebel base is on a
moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the planet.

EXT. YAVIN - JUNGLE

A lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape,
surveying the countryside. A mist hangs over the jungle of
twisted green.

INT. MASSASSI - WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA

Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia
and several other senators are to one side of the giant
readout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots,
navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is
listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and
Chewbacca are standing near the back.

DODONNA
The battle station is heavily shielded
and carries a firepower greater than
half the star fleet. It's defenses
are designed around a direct large-
scale assault. A small one-man fighter
should be able to penetrate the outer
defense.

Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties, stands
and addresses Dodonna.

GOLD LEADER
Pardon me for asking, sir, but what
good are snub fighters going to be
against that?

DODONNA
Well, the Empire doesn't consider a
small one-man fighter to be any
threat, or they'd have a tighter
defense. An analysis of the plans
provided by Princess Leia has
demonstrated a weakness in the battle
station.

Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping
sounds, and turns his head from right to left.

DODONNA
The approach will not be easy. You
are required to maneuver straight
down this trench and skim the surface
to this point. The target area is
only two meters wide. It's a small
thermal exhaust port, right below
the main port. The shaft leads
directly to the reactor system. A
precise hit will start a chain
reaction which should destroy the
station.

A murmer of disbelief runs through the room.

DODONNA
Only a precise hit will set up a
chain reaction. The shaft is ray-
shielded, so you'll have to use proton
torpedoes.

Luke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot about
sixteen years old.

WEDGE
That's impossible, even for a
computer.

LUKE
It's not impossible. I used to bull's-
eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back
home. They're not much bigger than
two meters.

DODONNA
Man your ships! And may the Force be
with you!

The group rises and begins to leave.

EXT. SPACE

The Death Star begins to move around the planet toward the
tiny green moon.

INT. DEATH STAR

Tarkin and Vader watch the computer projected screen with
interest, as a circle of lights intertwines around one another
on the screen showing it's position in relation to Yavin and
the forth moon.

DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE

Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity. The moon with the
Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.

VADER
This will be a day long remembered.
It has seen the end of Kenobi and it
will soon see the end of the
Rebellion.

INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship
hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters.
Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and
unlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this
activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes
onto an armored speeder.

MAN'S VOICE
(over loudspeaker)
All flight trooper, man your stations.
All flight troops, man your stations.

Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter
pilots' preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of
his friend's departure.

LUKE
So... you got your reward and you're
just leaving then?

HAN
That's right, yeah! I got some old
debts I've got to pay off with this
stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't
think I'd be fool enough to stick
around here, do you? Why don't you
come with us? You're pretty good in
a fight. I could use you.

LUKE
(getting angry)
Come on! Why don't you take a look
around? You know what's about to
happen, what they're up against.
They could use a good pilot like
you. You're turning your back on
them.

HAN
What good's a reward if you ain't
around to use it? Besides, attacking
that battle station ain't my idea of
courage. It's more like suicide.

LUKE
All right. Well, take care of
yourself, Han. I guess that's what
you're best at, isn't it?

Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.

HAN
Hey, Luke... may the Force be with
you!

Luke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in
a small wave and then goes off.

Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,

HAN
What're you lookin' at? I know what
I'm doing.

INT. MAIN HANGAR DECK - LUKE'S SHIP

Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.

LEIA
What's wrong?

LUKE
Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really
thought he'd change his mind.

LEIA
He's got to follow his own path. No
one can choose it for him.

LUKE
I only wish Ben were here.

Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke
heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs
his arm.

BIGGS
Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you
get here... are you going out with
us?!

LUKE
Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there
with you! Listen, have I got some
stories to tell...

Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up
behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born
leader.

RED LEADER
Are you... Luke Skywalker? Have you
been checked out on the Incom T-sixty-
five?

BIGGS
Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in
the outer rim territories.

Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of
his fighter.

RED LEADER
I met your father once when I was
just a boy, he was a great pilot.
You'll do all right. If you've got
half of your father's skill, you'll
do better than all right.

LUKE
Thank you, sir. I'll try.

Red Leader hurries to his own ship.

BIGGS
I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll
tell me your stories when we come
back. All right?

LUKE
I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.

BIGGS
(going off)
You did, all right. It's going to be
like old times, Luke. We're a couple
of shooting stars that'll never be
stopped!

Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for
his ship.

As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek, deadly
spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft, points
to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on the
back of the fighter.

CHIEF
This R2 unit of your seems a bit
beat up. Do you want a new one?

LUKE
Not on your life! That little droid
and I have been through a lot
together.
(to Artoo)
You okay, Artoo?

The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of
the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps
that he is fine.

Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an
his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive
hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner
into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo
beeps good-bye.

CHIEF
Okay, easy she goes!

THREEPIO
Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to
come back.

Artoo beeps in agreement.

THREEPIO
You wouldn't want my life to get
boring, would you?

Artoo whistles his reply.

All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.
The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the
pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The
hum of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted
voice of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses
are disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit
shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman,
holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace
of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.

BEN'S VOICE
Luke, the Force will be with you.

Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.

EXT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - JUNGLE

All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing
on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. The
muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this
eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion
rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage
in a tight formation and disappears into the morning cloud
cover.

INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

The princess, Threepio, and a field commander sit quietly
before the giant display showing the planet Yavin and its
four moons. The red dot that represents the Death Star moves
ever closer to the system. A series of green dots appear
around the fourth moon. A din of indistinct chatter fills
the war room.

MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE
Stand-by alert. Death Star
approaching. Estimated time to firing
range, fifteen minutes.

EXT. SPACE

The Death Star slowly moves behind the massive yellow surface
of Yavin in the foreground, as many X-wing fighters flying
in formation zoom toward us and out of the frame.

EXT. SPACE - ANOTHER ANGLE

Light from a distant sun creates an eerie atmospheric glow
around a huge planet, Yavin. Rebel fighters flying in
formation settle ominously in the foreground and very slowly
pull away.

INT. RED LEADER STARSHIP - COCKPIT

Red Leader lowers his visor and adjusts his gun sights,
looking to each side at his wing men.

RED LEADER
All wings report in.

INT. ANOTHER COCKPIT

One of the Rebel fighters checks in through his mike.

EXT. SPACE

The group of X-wing fighters move in formation toward the
Death Star, unfolding the wings and locking them in the "X"
position.

INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT

READ LEADER
(over headset)
We're passing through their magnetic
field.

INT. RED LEADER'S COCKPIT

RED LEADER
Hold tight!

INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

Luke adjusts his controls as he concentrates on the
approaching Death Star. The ship begins to be buffeted
slightly.

RED LEADER
(over headset)
Switch your deflectors on.

INT. ANOTHER COCKPIT

RED LEADER
(over headset)
Double front!

EXT. SPACE

The fighters, now X-shaped darts, move in formation. The
Death Star now appears to be a small moon growing rapidly in
size as the Rebel fighters approach. Complex patterns on the
metallic surface begin to become visible. A large dish antenna
is built into the surface on one side.

INT. WEDGE'S COCKPIT

Wedge is amazed and slightly frightened at the awesome
spectacle.

WEDGE
Look at the size of that thing!

RED LEADER
(over headset)
Cut the chatter, Red Two.

INT. RED LEADER'S COCKPIT

RED LEADER
Accelerate to attack speed. This is
it, boys!

EXT. SPACE

As the fighters move closer to the Death Star, the awesome
size of the gargantuan Imperial fortress is revealed. Half
of the deadly space station is in shadow and this area
sparkles with thousands of small lights running in thin lines
and occasionally grouped in large clusters; somewhat like a
city at night as seen from a weather satellite.

INT. GOLD LEADER'S COCKPIT

GOLD LEADER
Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

RED LEADER
(over headset)
I copy, Gold Leader.

GOLD LEADER
We're starting for the target shaft
now.

INT. RED LEADER'S COCKPIT

Red Leader looks around at his wingmen; the Death Star looming
in from behind. Two Y-wing fighters bob back and forth in
the background. He moves his computer targeting device into
position.

RED LEADER
We're in position. I'm going to cut
across the axis and try and draw
their fire.

EXT. SPACE

Two squads of Rebel fighters peel off. The X-wings dive
towards the Death Star surface. A thousand lights glow across
the dark grey expanse of the huge station.

INT. DEATH STAR

Alarm sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo-
powered laser gun emplacements. Electronic drivers rotate
the huge guns into position as crew adjust their targeting
devices.

EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

Laserbolts streak through the star-filled night. The Rebel X-
wing fighters move in toward the Imperial base, as the Death
Star aims its massive laser guns at the Rebel forces and
fires.

INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

Princess Leia listens to the battle over the intercom.
Threepio is at her side.

WEDGE
(over war room speaker
system)
Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees.

RED LEADER
(over speaker)
I see it. Stay low.

EXT. SPACE

An X-wing zooms across the surface of the Death Star.

INT. DEATH STAR

Technical crews scurry here and there loading last-minute
armaments and unlocking power cables.

INT. WEDGE'S COCKPIT

Wedge maneuvers his fighter toward the menacing Death Star.

EXT. SPACE

X-wings continue in their attack course on the Death Star.

INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

Luke nosedives radically, starting his attack on the monstrous
fortress. The Death Star surface streaks past the cockpit
window.

LUKE
This is Red Five; I'm going in!

EXT. SPACE

Luke's X-wing races toward the Death Star. Laserbolts streak
from Luke's weapons, creating a huge fireball explosion on
the dim surface.

INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

Terror crosses Luke's face as he realizes he won't be able
to pull out in time to avoid the fireball.

BIGGS
(over headset)
Luke, pull up!

EXT. SURFACE OF DEATH STAR

Luke's ship emerges from the fireball, with the leading edges
of his wings slightly scorched.

INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT

BIGGS
Are you all right?

INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT

Luke adjusts his controls and breathes a sigh of relief.
Flak bursts outside the cockpit window.

LUKE
I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.

EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

Rebel fighters continue to strafe the Death Star's surface
with laserbolts.

INT. DEATH STAR

Walls buckle and cave in. Troops and equipment are blown in
all directions. Stormtroopers stagger out of the rubble.
Standing in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and
foreboding, is Darth Vader. One of his Astro-Officers rushes
up to him.

ASTRO-OFFICER
We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord
Vader. But they're so small they're
evading our turbo-lasers!

VADER
We'll have to destroy them ship to
ship. Get the crews to their fighters.

INT. DEATH STAR

Smoke belches from the giant laser guns as they wind up their
turbine generators to create sufficient power. The crew rushes
about preparing for another blast. Even the troopers head
gear is not adequate to protect them from the overwhelming
noise of the monstrous weapon. One troopers bangs his helmet
with his hand in an attempt to stop the ringing.

INT. READ LEADER'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

Red Leader flies through a heavy hail of flak.

RED LEADER
Luke, let me know when you're going
in.

INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

The Red Leader's X-wing flies past Luke as he puts his nose
down and starts his attack dive.

LUKE
I'm on my way in now...

RED LEADER
Watch yourself! There's a lot of
fire coming from the right side of
that deflection tower.

LUKE
I'm on it.

EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

Luke flings his X-wing into a twisting dive across the horizon
and down onto the dim grey surface.

EXT. LUKE'S X-WING TRAVELING

A shot hurls from Luke's guns. Laserbolts streak toward the
onrushing Death Star surface. Several small radar emplacements
erupt in flame. Laserfire erupts from a protruding tower on
the surface.

INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

The blurry Death Star surface races past the cockpit window
as a big smile sweeps across Luke's face at the success of
his run. Flak thunders on all sides of him.

EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

The Death Star superstructure races past Luke as he maneuvers
his craft through a wall of laserfire and peels away from
the surface towards the heavens.

INT. DEATH STAR

The thunder and smoke of the big guns reverberate throughout
the massive structure. Many soldiers rush about in the smoke
and chaos, silhouetted by the almost continual flash of
explosions.

INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

Biggs dives through a forest of radar domes, antennae, and
gun towers as he shoots low across the Death Star surface. A
dense barrage of laserfire streaks by on all sides.

INT. DEATH STAR

Imperial star pilots dash in unison to a line of small
auxiliary hatches that lead to Imperial TIE fighters.

INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

Princess Leia, surrounded by her generals and aides, paces
nervously before a lighted computer table. On all sides
technicians work in front of many lighted glass walls. Dodonna
watches quietly from one corner. One of the officers working
over a screen speaks into his headset.

CONTROL OFFICER
Squad leaders, we've picked up a new
group of signals. Enemy fighters
coming your way.

INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

Luke looks around to see if he can spot the approaching
Imperial fighters.

LUKE
My scope's negative. I don't see
anything.

INT. RED LEADER'S X-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

The Death Star's surface sweeps past as Red Leader searches
the sky for the Imperial fighters. Flak pounds at his ship.

RED LEADER
Keep up your visual scanning. With
all this jamming, they'll be on top
of you before your scope can pick
them up.

EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

Silhouetted against the rim lights of the Death Star horizon,
four ferocious Imperial TIE ships dive on the Rebel fighters.
Two of the TIE fighters peel off and drop out of frame. Pan
with the remaining two TIE ships.

INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

Biggs panics when he discovers a TIE ship on his tail. The
horizon in the background twists around as he peels off,
hoping to lose the Imperial fighter.

INT. RED LEADER'S COCKPIT

RED LEADER
Biggs! You've picked one up... watch
it!

BIGGS
I can't see it! Where is he?!

EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

Biggs zooms off the surface and into space, closely followed
by an Imperial TIE fighter. The TIE ship fires several
laserbolts at Biggs, but misses.

INT. BIGGS' COCKPIT - TRAVELING

Biggs see the TIE ship behind him and swings around, trying
to avoid him.

BIGGS
He's on me tight, I can't shake him...
I can't shake him.

EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

Biggs, flying at high altitude, peels off and dives toward
the Death Star surface, but he is unable to lose the TIE
fighter, who sticks close to his tail.

INT. X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

Luke is flying upside down. He rotates his ship around to
normal attitude as he comes out of his dive.

LUKE
Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in.

EXT. SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

Biggs and the tailing TIE ship dive for the surface, now
followed by a fast-gaining Luke. After Biggs dives out of
sight, Luke chases the Imperial fighter.

EXT. SURFACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR

In the foreground, the Imperial fighter races across the
Death Star's surface, closely followed by Luke in the
background.

INT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

There is a shot from Luke's X-wing of the TIE ship exploding
in a mass of flames.

LUKE
Got him!

INT. DEATH STAR

Darth Vader strides purposefully down a Death Star corridor,
flanked by Imperial stormtroopers.

LUKE
I'm hit, but not bad.

EXT. LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER

Smoke pours out from behind Artoo-Detoo.

LUKE'S VOICE
Artoo, see what you can do with it.
Hang on back there.

Green laserfire moves past the beeping little robot as his
head turns.

INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke nervously works his controls.

RED LEADER
(over headset)
Red Six...

INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

In the war room, Leia stands frozen as she listens and worries
about Luke.

INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke spots the TIE fighter behind him and soars away from
the Death Star surface.

LUKE
I can't shake him!

EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

Luke's ship soars closer to the surface of the Death Star,
an Imperial TIE fighter closing in on him in hot pursuit.

INT. WEDGE'S COCKPIT

The Death Star whips below Wedge.

WEDGE
I'm on him, Luke!

INT. LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

WEDGE
(over headset)
Hold on!

EXT. SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR

Wedge dives across the horizon toward Luke and the TIE
fighter.

INT. WEDGE'S COCKPIT

surface of the huge station. The ship moves into a deep
trench, firing laserbolts. The surface streaks past as
laserfire is returned by the Death Star.

INT. GOLD FIVE'S Y-WING - COCKPIT - TRAVELING

Gold Five is a pilot in his early fifties with a very battered
helmet that looks like it's been through many battles. He
looks around to see if enemy ships are near. His fighter is
buffeted by Imperial flak.

INT. GOLD LEADER'S Y-WING - COCKPIT

Gold Leader races down the enormous trench that leads to the
exhaust port. Laserbolts blast toward him in increasing
numbers, occasionally exploding near the ship causing it to
bounce about.

How many guns do you think, Gold
Five.

INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - WAR ROOM

GOLD FIVE
(over speaker)
I'd say about twenty guns. Some on
the surface, some on the towers.

Leia, Threepio, and the technicians view the projected target
screen, as red and blue target lights glow. The red target
near the center blinks on and off.

targeting eye viewer and adjusts it. His ship shudders under
intense laser barrage.

GOLD TWO
Computer's locked. Getting a signal.

As the fighters begin to approach the target area, suddenly
all the laserfire stops. An eerie clam clings over the trench
as the surface whips past in a blur.

GOLD TWO
The guns... they've stopped!

EXT. GOLD FIVE'S COCKPIT

Gold Five looks behind him.

Hey! Hey!

(laughing)
I knew you'd come back! I just knew
it!

Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all
the credit and take all the reward.

at Luke's face. Leia moves in between them.

LEIA
(laughing)
Hey, I knew there was more to you
than money.

Luke looks toward the ship.

LUKE
Oh, no!

The fried little Artoo-Detoo is lifted off the back of the
fighter and carried off under the worried eyes of Threepio.

THREEPIO
Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say
something!
(to mechanic)
You can repair him, can't you?

TECHNICIAN
We'll get to work on him right away.

gladly donate them.

He'll be all right.

INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN THRONE ROOM

Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main
temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners
are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the
beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly
march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From
one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired
Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to
an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the
whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other
dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is
dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.
She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He
winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who
is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled
troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo
beeps with happiness.

RESERVOIR DOGS

1      INT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING

Eight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a
breakfast cafe.  They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE,
MR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT,
and the big boss, JOE CABOT.  Most are finished eating and
are enjoying coffee and conversation.  Joe flips through a
small address book.  Mr. Pink is telling a long and
involved story about Madonna.

MR. PINK
"Like a Virgin" is all about a
girl who digs a guy with a big
dick.  The whole song is a
metaphor for big dicks.

MR. BLUE
No it's not.  It's about a girl
who is very vulnerable and she's
been fucked over a few times.
Then she meets some guy who's
really sensitive--

MR. PINK
--Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay.
Tell that bullshit to the
tourists.

JOE
(looking through his
address book)
Toby...who the fuck is Toby?
Toby...Toby...think...think...
think...

MR. PINK
It's not about a nice girl who
meets a sensitive boy.  Now
granted that's what "True Blue" is
about, no argument about that.

MR. ORANGE
Which one is "True Blue?"

NICE GUY EDDIE
You don't remember "True Blue?"
That was a big ass hit for
Madonna.  Shit, I don't even
follow this Tops In Pops shit, and
I've at least heard of "True
Blue."

MR. ORANGE
Look, asshole, I didn't say I
ain't heard of it.  All I asked
was how does it go?  Excuse me
for not being the world's biggest
Madonna fan.

MR. BROWN
I hate Madonna.

MR. BLUE
I like her early stuff.  You know,
"Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but
once she got into her "Papa Don't
Preach" phase, I don't know, I
tuned out.

MR. PINK
Hey, fuck all that, I'm
making a point here.  You're gonna
make me lose my train
of thought.

JOE
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china
girl.

MR. WHITE
What's that?

JOE
I found this old address book in a
jacket I ain't worn in a coon's
age.  Toby what?  What the fuck
was her last name?

MR. PINK
Where was I?

MR. ORANGE
You said "True Blue" was about a
nice girl who finds a sensitive
fella.  But "Like a Virgin" was a
metaphor for big dicks.

MR. PINK
Let me tell ya what "Like a
Virgin"'s about.  It's about some
cooze who's a regular fuck
machine.
I mean all the time, morning, day,
night, afternoon, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick.

MR. BLUE
How many dicks was that?

MR. WHITE
A lot.

MR. PINK
Then one day she meets a John
Holmes motherfucker, and it's
like, whoa baby.  This mother
fucker's like Charles Bronson in
"The Great Escape."  He's diggin
tunnels.  Now she's gettin this
serious dick action, she's feelin
something she ain't felt since
forever.  Pain.

JOE
Chew?  Toby Chew?  No.

MR. PINK
It hurts.  It hurts her.  It
shouldn't hurt.  Her pussy should
be Bubble-Yum by now.  But when
this cat fucks her, it hurts.  It
hurts like the first time.  The
pain is reminding a fuck machine
what is was like to be a virgin.
Hence, "Like a Virgin."

The fellas crack up.

JOE
Wong?

MR. PINK
Fuck you, wrong.  I'm right!  What
the fuck do you know about it
anyway?  You're still listening to
Jerry-fucking-Vale.

JOE
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong!  You
know, like the Chinese name?

Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand.  They
fight, but they're not really mad at each other.

MR. WHITE
Give me this fucking thing.

JOE
What the fuck do you think you're
doin?  Give me my book back!

MR. WHITE
I'm sick of fuckin hearin it Joe,
I'll give it back when we leave.

JOE
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when
we leave, give it back now.

MR. WHITE
For the past fifteen minutes now,
you've just been droning on with
names.  "Toby...Toby...Toby...
Toby Wong...Toby Wong...Toby
Chung...fuckin Charlie Chan."  I
got Madonna's big dick outta my
right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-
know-what, outta my left.

JOE
What do you care?

MR. WHITE
When you're annoying as hell, I
care a lot.

JOE
Give me my book.

MR. WHITE
You gonna put it away?

JOE
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do
with it.

MR. WHITE
Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to keep it.

MR. BLONDE
Joe, you want me to shoot him for
you?

MR. WHITE
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you
better wake up and apologize.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Have you guys been listening to K-
BILLY's super sounds of the
seventies weekend?

MR. PINK
Yeah, it's fuckin great isn't it?

NICE GUY EDDIE
Can you believe the songs they
been playin?

MR. PINK
No, I can't.  You know what I
heard the other day?  "Heartbeat -
It's Lovebeat," by little Tony
DeFranco and the DeFranco Family.
I haven't heard that since I was
in fifth fuckin grade.

NICE GUY EDDIE
When I was coming down here, I was
playin it.  And "The Night the
Lights Went Out in Georgia" came
on.  Now I ain't heard that song
since it was big, but when it was
big, I heard it a million-
trillion times.  I'm listening to
it this morning, and this was the
first time I ever realized that
the lady singing the song, was the
one who killed Andy.

MR. BLUE
You didn't know Vicki Lawrence
killed the guy?

NICE GUY EDDIE
I thought the cheatin wife shot
Andy.

MR. BLONDE
They say it in the song.

NICE GUY EDDIE
I know, I heard it.  I musta zoned
out whenever that part came on
before.  I thought when she said
that little sister stuff, she was
talkin about her sister- in-law,
the cheatin wife.

JOE
No, she did it.  She killed the
cheatin wife, too.

MR. PINK
You know the part in "Gypsies,
Tramps and Theives," when she says
"Poppa woulda shot his if he knew
what he'd done?"  I could never
figure out what he did.

The table laughs.  The WAITRESS comes over to the table.
She has the check, and a pot of coffee.

WAITRESS
Can I get anybody more
coffee.

JOE
No, we're gonna be hittin it.
I'll take care of the check.

She hands the bill to him.

WAITRESS
Here ya go.  Please pay at the
register, if you wouldn't mind.

JOE
Sure thing.

WAITRESS
You guys have a wonderful day.

They all mutter equivalents.  She exits and Joe stands up.

JOE
I'll take care of this, you guys
leave the tip.
(to Mr. White)
And when I come back, I want my
book back.

MR. WHITE
Sorry, it's my book now.

JOE
Blonde, shoot this piece of shit,
will ya?

Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger.  Mr White
acts shot.  Joe exits.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Okay, everybody cough up green for
the little lady.

Everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table.
Everybody, that is, except Mr. White.

NICE GUY EDDIE
C'mon, throw in a buck.

MR. WHITE
Uh-uh.  I don't tip.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Whaddaya mean you don't tip?

MR. WHITE
I don't believe in it.

NICE GUY EDDIE
You don't believe in tipping?

MR. PINK
(laughing)
I love this kid, he's a madman,
this guy.

MR. BLONDE
Do you have any idea what these
ladies make?  They make shit.

MR. WHITE
Don't give me that.  She don't
make enough money, she can quit.

Everybody laughs.

NICE GUY EDDIE
I don't even know a Jew who'd have
the balls to say that.  So let's
get this straight. You never ever
tip?

MR. WHITE
I don't tip because society says I
gotta.  I tip when somebody
deserves a tip.  When somebody
really puts forth an effort, they
deserve a little something extra.
But this tipping automatically,
that shit's for the birds.  As far
as I'm concerned, they're just
doin their job.

MR. BLUE
Our girl was nice.

MR. WHITE
Our girl was okay.  She didn't do
anything special.

MR. BLONDE
What's something special, take ya
in the kitchen and suck your dick?

They all laugh.

NICE GUY EDDIE
I'd go over twelve percent for
that.

MR. WRITE
Look, I ordered coffee.  Now we've
been here a long fuckin time, and
she's only filled my cup three
times.  When I order coffee,  I
want it filled six times.

MR. BLONDE
What if she's too busy?

MR. WHITE
The words "too busy" shouldn't be
in a waitress's vocabulary.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last
thing you need is another cup of
coffee.

They all laugh.

MR. WHITE
These ladies aren't starvin to
death.  They make minimum wage.
When I worked for minimum wage, I
wasn't lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tipworthy.

NICE GUY EDDIE
Ahh, now we're getting down to it.
It's not just that he's a cheap
bastard--

MR. ORANGE
--It is that too--

NICE GUY EDDIE
--It is that too.  But it's also
he couldn't get a waiter job.  You
talk like a pissed off dishwasher:
"Fuck those cunts and their
fucking tips."

MR. BLONDE
So you don't care that they're
counting on your tip to live?

Mr. White rubs two of his fingers together.

MR. WHITE
Do you know what this is?  It's
the world's smallest violin,
playing just for the waitresses.

MR. BLONDE
You don't have any idea what
you're talking about.  These
people bust their ass. This
is a hard job.

MR. WHITE
So's working at McDonald's, but
you don't feel the need to tip
them.  They're servin ya food, you
should tip em.  But no, society
says tip these guys over here, but
not those guys over there.  That's
bullshit.

MR. ORANGE
They work harder than the kids at
McDonald's.

MR. WHITE
Oh yeah, I don't see them cleaning
fryers.

MR. BROWN
These people are taxed on the tips
they make.  When you stiff 'em,
you cost them money.

MR. BLONDE
Waitressing is the number one
occupation for female non-college
graduates in this country.  It's
the one jab basically any woman
can get, and make a living on.
The reason is because of tips.

MR. WHITE
Fuck all that.

They all laugh.

MR. WHITE
Hey, I'm very sorry that the
government taxes their tips.
That's fucked up.  But that ain't
my fault.  it would appear that
waitresses are just one of the
many groups the government fucks
in the ass on a regular basis.
You show me a paper says the
government shouldn't do that, I'll
sign it.  Put it to a vote, I'll
vote for it.  But what I won't do
is play ball.  And this non-
college bullshit you're telling
me, I got two words for that:
"Learn to fuckin type."  Cause if
you're expecting me to help out
with the rent, you're in for a big
fuckin surprise.

MR. ORANGE
He's convinced me.  Give me my
dollar back.

Everybody laughs.  Joe's comes back to the table.

JOE
Okay ramblers, let's get to
rambling.  Wait a minute, who
didn't throw in?

MR. ORANGE
Mr. White.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
Mr. White?
(to Mr. White)
Why?

MR. ORANGE
He don't tip.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
He don't tip?
(to Mr. White)
You don't tip?  Why?

MR. ORANGE
He don't believe in it.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
He don't believe in it?
(to Mr. White)
You don't believe in it?

MR. ORANGE
Nope.

JOE
(to Mr. Orange)
Shut up!
(to Mr. White)
Cough up the buck, ya cheap
bastard, I paid for your goddamn
breakfast.

MR. WHITE
Because you paid for the
breakfast, I'm gonna tip.
Normally I wouldn't.

JOE
Whatever.  Just throw in your
dollar, and let's move.
(to Mr. Blonde)
See what I'm dealing with here.
Infants.  I'm fuckin dealin with
infants.

The eight men get up to leave.  Mr. White's waist is in
the F.G.  As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's
carrying a gun.  They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House,
talking amongst themselves.


2      EXT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY

CREDIT SEQUENCE:

When the credit sequence is finished, we    FADE TO BLACK:

Over the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in
agony.

Under the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING
ASS, through traffic.

Over the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY
ELSE SAY:

SOMEBODY ELSE (OS)
Just hold on buddy boy.

Somebody stops screaming long enough to say:

SOMEBODY (OS)
I'm sorry.  I can't believe
she killed me.  Who would've
fuckin thought that?

CUT TO:

3      INT. GETAWAY GAR (MOVING) - DAY

The Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange.  He lies in the
backseat.  He's been SHOT in the stomach.  BLOOD covers
both him and the backseat.

Mr. White is the Somebody Else.  He's behind the wheel of
the getaway car.  He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and
out of traffic.  Though he's driving for his life, he
keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat.

They are the only two in the car.

MR. WHITE
Hey, just cancel that shit right
now!  You're hurt.  You're hurt
really fucking bad, but you ain't
dying.

MR. ORANGE
(crying)
All this blood is scaring the shit
outta me.  I'm gonna die, I know
it.

MR. WHITE
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you
had a degree in medicine.  Are you
a doctor?  Are you a doctor?
Answer me please, are you a
doctor?

MR. ORANGE
No, I'm not!

MR. WRITE
Ahhhh, so you admit you don't know
what you're talking about.  So if
you're through giving me your
amateur opinion, lie back and
listen to the news.  I'm taking
you back to the rendezvous, Joe's
gonna get you a doctor, the
doctor's gonna fix you up, and
you're gonna be okay.  Now say it:
you're gonna be okay.  Say it:
you're gonna be okay!

Mr. Orange doesn't respond.  Mr. White starts pounding on
the steering wheel.

MR. WHITE
Say-the-goddamn-words: you're
gonna be okay!

MR. ORANGE
I'm okay.

MR. WHITE
(softly)
Correct.

4      INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The CAMERA does a 360 around an empty warehouse.  Then the
door swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of
Mr. Orange inside.

Mr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit.

Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.

MR. WHITE
Just hold on buddy boy.  Hold on,
and wait for Joe.  I can't do
anything for you, but when Joe
gets here, which should be anytime
now, he'll be able to help you.
We're just gonna sit here, and
wait for Joe.  Who are
we waiting for?

MR. ORANGE
Joe.

MR. WHITE
Bet your sweet ass we are.

Mr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl
around the warehouse.

MR. ORANGE
(yelling)
Don't leave me!

Mr White bends back over him and takes his hand.

MR. WHITE
I ain't going anywhere.  I'm right
here.  I'm not gonna leave ya.

MR. ORANGE
Larry, I'm so scared, would you
please hold me.

Mr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange.
Cradling the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.

MR. WHITE
(whispering)
Go ahead and be scared, you've
been brave enough for one day.  I
want you to just relax now.
You're not gonna die, you're gonna
be fine.  When Joe gets here,
he'll make ya a hundred percent
again.

Mr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress.  He's
still holding his hand.  Mr. Orange looks up at his
friend.

MR. ORANGE
Look, I don't wanna be a fly in
the ointment, but if help doesn't
come soon, I gotta see a doctor.
I don't give a fuck about jail, I
just don't wanna die.

MR. WHITE
You're not gonna fucking die, all
right?

MR. ORANGE
I wasn't born yesterday.  I'm
hurt, and I'm hurt bad.

MR. WHITE
It's not good...

MR. ORANGE
Hey, bless your heart for what
you're trying to do.  I was
panicking for a moment, but I've
got my senses back now.  The
situation is, I'm shot in the
belly.  And without medical
attention, I'm gonna die.

MR. WHITE
I can' take you to a hospital.

MR. ORANGE
Fuck jail!  I don't give a shit
about jail.  But I can't die.  You
don't have to take me in.  Just
drive me up to the front, drop me
on the sidewalk.  I'll take care
of myself.  I won't tell them
anything.  I swear to fucking god,
I won't tell 'em anything.  Look
in my eyes, look right in my eyes.
(Mr. White does)
I-won't-tell-them-anything.
You'll be safe.

MR. WHITE
Lie back down, and try to--

MR. ORANGE
I'm going to die!   I need a
doctor!  I'm begging you,
take me to a doctor.

Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress.  Spent from
his outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:

MR. ORANGE
Take me to a doctor, take me to a
doctor, please.

Suddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr.
Pink steps inside.

MR. PINK
Was that a fucking set-up or what?

Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.

MR. PINK
Oh fuck, Orange got tagged.

Throughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.

MR. WHITE
Gun shot.

MR. PINK
Oh that's just fucking great!
Where's Brown?

MR. WHITE
Dead.

MR. PINK
Goddamn, goddamn!  How did he die?

MR. WHITE
How the fuck do you think?  The
cops shot him.

MR. PINK
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.
(referring to Mr.
Orange)
Is it bad?

MR. WHITE
As opposed to good?

MR. PINK
This is so fucked up.  Somebody
fucked us big time.

MR. WHITE
You really think we were set up?

MR. PINK
You even doubt it?  I don't think
we got set up, I know we got set
up!  I mean really, seriously,
where did all those cops come
from, huh?  One minute they're not
there, the next minute
they're there.  I didn't hear any
sirens.  The alarm went off, okay.
Okay, when an alarm goes off, you
got an average of four minutes
response time.  Unless a patrol
car is cruising that street, at
that particular moment, you got
four minutes before they can
realistically respond.  In one
minute there were seventeen blue
boys out there.  All loaded for
bear, all knowing exactly what the
fuck they were doing, and they
were all just there!  Remember
that second wave that showed up in
the cars? Those were the ones
responding to the alarm.  but
those other motherfuckers were
already there, they were waiting
for us.
(pause)
You haven't thought about this?

MR. WHITE
I haven't had a chance to think.
First I was just trying to get the
fuck outta there.  And after we
got away, I've just been dealin
with him.

MR. PINK
Well, you better start thinking
about it.  Cause I, sure as fuck,
am thinking about it.  In fact,
that's all I'm thinking about.  I
came this close to just driving
off.  Whoever set us up, knows
about this place.  There could've
been cops sitting here waiting for
me.  For all we know, there's
cops, driving fast, on their way
here now.

MR. WHITE
Let's go in the other room...

The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner.  We
move past it, and see down a hall.

5      INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY

At the end of the hall is a bathroom.  The bathroom door
is partially closed, restricting our view.  Mr. Pink is
obscured, but Mr. White is in view.

MR. PINK (OS)
What the fuck am I doing here?  I
felt funny about this job right
off.  As soon as I felt it I
should said "No thank you", and
walked.  But I never fucking
listen.  Every time I ever got
burned buying weed, I always knew
the guy wasn't right.  I just felt
it.  But I wanted to believe him.
If he's not lyin to me, and it
really is Thai stick, then whoa
baby.  But it's never Thai stick.
and I always said if I felt that
way about a job, I'd walk.  And I
did, and I didn't, because of
fuckin money!

MR. WHITE
What's done is done, I need you
cool.  Are you cool?

MR. PINK
I'm cool.

MR. WHITE
Splash some water on your face.
Take a breather.

We hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on
his face.

MR. WHITE
I'm gonna get me my smokes.

Mr White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and
OUT OF FRAME.  We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards
us, bent over the sink.  Then he grabs a towels, and dries
his face.  Mr White ENTERS FRAME with a pack of
Chesterfields in his hand.

MR. WHITE
Want a smoke?

MR. PINK
Why not?

The two men light up.

MR. WHITE
Okay, let's go through what
happened.  We're in the place,
everything's going fine.  Then the
alarm gets tripped.  I turn around
and all these cops are outside.
You're right, it was like, bam!  I
blink my eyes are they're there.
Everybody starts going apeshit.
Then Mr. Blonde starts shootin all
the--

MR. PINK
--That's not correct.

MR. WHITE
What's wrong with it?

MR. PINK
The cops didn't show up after the
alarm went off.  They didn't show
till after Mr. Blonde started
shooting everyone.

MR. WHITE
As soon as I heard the alarm, I
saw the cops.

MR. PINK
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that
soon.  They didn't let their
presence be known until after Mr.
Blonde went off.  I'm not sayin
they weren't there, I'm sayin they
were there.  But they didn't move
in till Mr. Blonde became a
madman.  That's how I know we were
set up.  You can see that,
can't you, Mr. White?

MR. WHITE
Look, enough of this "Mr White"
shit--

MR. PINK
--Don't tell me your name, I don't
want to know!  I sure as hell
ain't gonna tell ya
mine.

MR. WHITE
You're right, this is bad.
(pause)
How did you get out?

MR. PINK
Shot my way out.  Everybody was
shooting, so I just blasted my way
outta there.

CUT TO:


6      EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - DAY

Mr. Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk.  He has
a canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357
MAGNUM in the other.  If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he
just knocks them down.  We DOLLY at the same speed, right
along side of him.

FOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink.  We DOLLY with
them.

We DOLLY with a young woman on roller skates.  ROLLERGIRL
is plugged into a walkman.  We hear the song she's
listening to LOUD over the SOUNDTRACK.  She's twirling and
skating backwards to the beat of the song.

Rollergirl turns a corner and COLLIDES with Mr. Pink.  The
man and woman CRASH to the ground.

Mr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car
that SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over
him.


7      INT. CAR (STOPPED) - DAY

The CAMERA is in the backseat. A SHOCKED WOMAN is the
car's driver.  Mr. Pink pulls himself up from the hood,
shakes it off, and points his magnum at the driver.

MR. PINK
Get outta the car!  Get the fuck
outta the car!

The Shocked Woman starts screaming.

Mr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's
locked.

MR. PINK
Open the fucking door!

EXTREME C.U. DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW

Mr. Pink SMASHES it in our face.


8      EXT. STREET - DAY

DOLLY with Cops coming up fast.

Mr. Pink DRAGS the Shocked Woman out of the car.

The Cops reach the corner, guns aimed.

Using the car as a shield, Mr. Pink FIRES three shots at
the Cops.

Everybody HITS the ground, or scatters.

Mr. Pink HOPS in the car.

Cops FIRE.


9      INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

CAMERA in the backseat, Mr. Pink FLOORS it.  SPEEDING down
the street, with the Cops FIRING after him.

BACK TO:


10     INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Mr. Pink and Mr. White still talking in the bathroom.

MR. PINK
Tagged a couple of cops.  Did you
kill anybody?

MR. WHITE
A few cops.

MR. PINK
No real people?

MR. WHITE
Uh-uh, just cops.

MR. PINK
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

MR. WHITE
That was one of the most insane
fucking things I've ever seen.
Why the fuck would Joe hire
somebody like that?

MR. PINK
I don't wanna kill anybody.  But
if I gotta get out that door, and
you're standing in my way, one way
of the other, you're gettin outta
my way.

MR. WHITE
That's the way I look at it.  A
choice between doin ten years, and
takin out some stupid
motherfucker, ain't no choice at
all.  But I ain't no madman
either.  What the fuck was Joe
thinkin?  You can't work with a
guy like that.  That mother-
fucker's unstable.  What do you
think?  Do you think he panicked,
or ya think he's just trigger-
happy?

MR. PINK
I think he's a sick fuckin maniac!
We're awful goddamn lucky he
didn't tag us, when
he shot up the place.  I came this
fucking close--
(hold up two fingers
and makes a tiny
space between them)
--to taking his ass out myself.
Everybody panics.  When things get
tense, everybody panics.
Everybody.  I don't care what your
name is, you can't help it.  It's
human nature.  But ya panic on the
inside.
Ya panic in your head.  Ya give
yourself a couple a seconds of
panic, then you get a grip and
deal with the situation.  What you
don't do, is shoot up the place
and kill everybody.

MR. WHITE
What you're supposed to do is act
like a fuckin professional.  A
psychopath is not a professional.
You can't work with a psychopath,
'cause ya don't know what those
sick assholes are gonna do next.
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do
you think that black girl was?
Twenty, maybe twenty-one?

MR. PINK
Did ya see what happened to
anybody else?

MR. WHITE
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the
car and Mr. Brown floored it.
After that, I don't know what went
down.

MR. PINK
At that point it became every man
for himself.  As far as Mr. Blonde
or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't
got the foggiest.  Once
I got out, I never looked back.

MR. WHITE
What do you think?

MR. PINK
What do I think?  I think the cops
caught them, or killed 'em.

MR. WHITE
Not even a chance they punched
through?  You found a hole.

MR. PINK
Yeah, and that was a fucking
miracle.  But if they did get
away, where the fuck are they?

MR. WHITE
You don't think it's possible, one
of them got ahold of the diamonds
and pulled a--

MR. PINK
Nope.

MR. WHITE
How can you be so sure?

MR. PINK
I got the diamonds.

MR. WHITE
Where?

MR. PINK
I got 'em, all right?

MR. WHITE
Where?  Are they out in the car?

MR. PINK
No, they're not in the car.  No, I
don't have them on me.  Ya wanna
go with me and get 'em?  Yes, we
can go right now.  But first
listen to what I'm telling you.
We were fuckin set up!  Somebody
is in league with the cops.  We
got a Judas in our midst.  And I'm
thinkin we should have our fuckin
heads examined for waiting around
here.

MR. WHITE
That was the plan, we meet here.

MR. PINK
Then where is everybody?  I say
the plan became null and void once
we found out we got a rat in the
house.  We ain't got the slightest
fuckin idea what happened to Mr.
Blonde or Mr. Blue.  They could
both be dead
or arrested.  They could be
sweatin 'em, down at the station
house right now.  Yeah they don't
know the names, but they can sing
about this place.
I mean, that could be happening
right now.  As we speak, the cops
could be in their cars, drivin
here this minute.

MR. WHITE
I swear to god I'm fuckin jinxed.

MR. PINK
What?

MR. WHITE
Two jobs back, it was a four man
job, we discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.

MR. PINK
No shit?

MR. WHITE
Thank god, we discovered in time.
We hadda forget the whole fuckin
thing.  Just walked away from it.

MR. PINK
So who's the rat this time?  Mr.
Blue?  Mr. Blonde?  Joe?  It's
Joe's show, he set this whole
thing up.  Maybe he set it up to
set it up.

MR. WHITE
I don't buy it.  Me and Joe go
back a long time.  I can tell ya
straight up, Joe definitely didn't
have anything to do with this
bullshit.

MR. PINK
Oh, you and Joe go back a long
time.  I known Joe since I was a
kid.  But me saying Joe definitely
couldn't have done it is
ridiculous.  I can say I
definitely didn't do it, cause I
know what I did or didn't do.  But
I can't definitely say that about
anybody else, 'cause I don't
definitely know.  For all I know,
you're the rat.

MR. WHITE
For all I know, you're the rat.

MR. PINK
Now you're using your head. For
all we know, he's the rat.

Mr. Pink points OFFSCREEN to Mr. Orange.  Mr. White's
expression changes.

MR. WHITE
Jesus Christ!


11     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

They run over to Mr. Orange, who's unconscious.  The
CAMERA hovers over the action.  Mr. Pink reaches him
first.

MR. PINK
Is he dead?

Mr. White pushes him out of the way.  He feels the pulse
on Mr. Orange's neck.

MR. PINK
So, is he dead or what?

MR. WHITE
He ain't dead.

MR. PINK
So what is it?

MR. WHITE
I think he's just passed out.

MR. PINK
He scared the fuckin shit outta
me.  I thought he was dead fer
sure.

Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table.

MR. WHITE
He will be dead fer sure, if we
don't get him to a hospital.

MR. PINK
We can't take him to a hospital.

MR. WHITE
Without medical attention, this
man won't live through the night.
That bullet in his belly is my
fault.  Now while that might not
mean jack shit to you, it means a
helluva lot to me.  And I'm not
gonna just sit around and watch
him die.

MR. PINK
Well, first things first, staying
here's goofy.  We gotta book up.

MR. WHITE
So what do you suggest, we go to a
hotel?  We got a guy who's shot in
the belly, he can't walk, he
bleeds like a stuck pig, and when
he's awake, he screams in pain.

MR. PINK
You gotta idea, spit it out.

MR. WHITE
Joe could help him.  If we can get
in touch with Joe, Joe could get
him to a doctor, Joe could get a
doctor to come and see him.

During Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a
C.U. of Mr. White.

MR. PINK (OS)
Assuming we can trust Joe, how we
gonna get in touch with him?  He's
supposed to be here, but he ain't,
which is making me nervous about
being here.  Even if Joe is
on the up and up, he's probably
not gonna be that happy with us.
Joe planned a robbery, but he's
got a blood bath on his hands now.
Dead cops, dead robbers, dead
civilians...Jesus Christ!  I tend
to doubt he's gonna have a lot of
sympathy for our plight.  If I was
him, I'd try and put as much
distance between me and this mess
an humanly possible.

MR. WHITE
Before you got here, Mr. Orange
was askin me to take him to a
hospital.  Now I don't like
turning him over to the cops, but
if we don't, he's dead.  He begged
me to do it.  I told him to hold
off till Joe got here.

MR. PINK (OS)
Well Joe ain't gettin here.  We're
on our own.  Now, I don't know a
goddamn body who can help him, so
if you know somebody, call 'em.

MR. WHITE
I don't know anybody.

MR. PINK (OS)
Well, I guess we drop him off at
the hospital.  Since he don't know
nothin about us, I say it's his
decision.


MR. WHITE'S POV:

C.U. OF MR. PINK.

MR. WHITE (OS)
Well, he knows a little about me.

MR. PINK
You didn't tell him your name, did
ya?

MR. WHITE (OS)
I told him my first name, and
where I'm from.

There is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink,
then he SCREAMS:

MR. PINK
Why!

MR. WHITE (OS)
I told him where I was from a few
days ago.  It was just a casual
conversation.

MR. PINK
And what was tellin him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

MR. WHITE (OS)
He asked.

Mr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.

MR. WHITE (OS)
We had just gotten away from the
cops.  He just got shot.  It was
my fuckin fault he got shot.  He's
a fuckin bloody mess - he's
screaming.  I swear to god, I
thought we was gonna die right
then and there.  I'm tryin to
comfort him, telling him not to
worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm
gonna take care of him.  And he
asked me what my name was.  I
mean, the man was dyin in my arms.
What the fuck was I supposed to
tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out
that information, it's against the
rules.  I don't trust you
enough."?  Maybe I shoulda, but I
couldn't.

MR. PINK
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite
beautiful--

MR. WHITE (OS)
Don't fuckin patronize me.

MR. PINK
One question: Do they have a sheet
on you, where you told him you're
from?

MR. WHITE (OS)
Of course.

MR. PINK
Well that's that, then.  I mean, I
was worried about mug shot
possibilities already.  But now he
knows: (a) what you look like, (b)
what your first name is,
(i) where you're from and (d) what
your specialty is.
They ain't gonna hafta show him a
helluva lot of pictures for him to
pick you out.  That's it right,
you didn't tell him anything else
that could narrow down the
selection?

MR. WHITE (OS)
If I have to tell you again to
back off, me an you are gonna go
round and round.

Mr. Pink walks out of the C.U. and turns his back on Mr.
White.  Mr. White's POV PANS over to him.

MR. PINK
We ain't taking him to a hospital.

MR. WHITE (OS)
If we don't, he'll die.

MR. PINK
And I'm very sad about that.  But
some fellas are lucky, and some
ain't.

MR. WHITE (OS)
That fuckin did it!

Mr. White's POV CHARGES toward Mr. Pink.

Mr. Pink turns toward him in time to get PUNCHED hard in
the mouth.

END OF POV

Mr. White and Mr. Pink have a very ungraceful and
realistic fight.  They go at each other like a couple of
alley cats.

As Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:

MR. WHITE

You little motherfucker!

Mr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:

MR. PINK
Ya wanna fuck with me?!  You wanna
fuck with me?!  I'll show you who
you're fuckin with!

The two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING.

Mr. White gets Mr. Pink in a HEADLOCK.

Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it
out.

Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink,
and goes for his own weapon.

The two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their
guns outstretched, aiming at one another.

MR. WHITE
You wanna shoot me, you little
piece of shit?  Take a shot!

MR. PINK
Fuck you, White!  I didn't create
this situation,  I'm just dealin
with it.  You're acting like a
first-year fuckin thief.  I'm
actin like a professional.  They
get him, they can get you, they
get you, they get closer to me,
and that can't happen.  And you,
you motherfucker, are looking at
me like it's my fault.  I didn't
tell him my name.  I didn't tell
him where I was from.  I didn't
tell him what I knew better than
to tell him.  Fuck, fifteen
minutes ago, you almost told me
your name.  You, buddy, are stuck
in a situation you created.  So if
you wanna throw bad looks
somewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.

Mr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White.

MR. PINK
So if you wanna shoot somebody,
put that gun in your mouth and
shoot yourself.

Then from OFF SCREEN we hear:

VOICE (OS)
You kids don't play so rough.
Somebody's gonna start crying.


12     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM C.U. ON MR. BLONDE

The Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde.

Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke
and eating a hot dog.

MR. PINK
Mr. Blonde!  You okay?  We thought
you might've gotten caught.  What
happened?

Mr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter
and starts walking around the warehouse, checking the
place out.

He doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he
just eats his hot dog and sips his coke.

This is making Pink and White nervous as hell.  But Mr.
Pink tries to talk through it.

We HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse.

MR. PINK
Really, how did you get away?

Mr. Blonde walks the loft.  Silent.

MR. PINK
You saw what happened to me,
I found a hole and booked.

Silence.

MR. PINK
Where's Mr. Blue?

Blonde looks in the bathroom.

MR. PINK
We were hopin you two would be
together.

Blonde looks out the window.

MR. PINK
That was the big question we had,
what happened to Mr.
Blue and you?

Blonde walks away from the window.

MR. PINK
We were worried the cops got ya.

Blonde bends down over Mr. Orange.

MR. PINK
He got it in the belly.  He's
still alive, but won't be for
long.

MR. WHITE
Enough!  You better start talkin
to us, asshole, cause we got shit
we need to talk about.  We're
already freaked out, we need you
actin freaky like we need a fuckin
bag on our hip.

Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves
towards them.

MR. BLONDE
So, talk.

MR. WHITE
We think we got a rat in the
house.

MR. PINK
I guarantee we got a rat in the
house.

MR. BLONDE
What would ever make you think
that?

MR. WHITE
Is that supposed to be funny?

MR. PINK
We don't think this place is safe.

MR. WHITE
This place just ain't secure
anymore.  We're leaving, and you
should go with us.

MR. BLONDE
Nobody's going anywhere.

Silence takes over the room.  Mr. Blonde stops moving.

After a few beats the silence is broken.

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Pink)
Piss on this turd, we're outta
here.

Mr. White turns to leave.

MR. BLONDE
Don't take another step, Mr.
White.

Mr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards
Mr. Blonde.

MR. WHITE
Fuck you, maniac!  It's your
fuckin fault we're in so much
trouble.

Mr. Blonde calmly sits down.  He looks to Mr. Pink.

MR. BLONDE
(referring to Mr.
White)
What's this guy's problem?

MR. WHITE
What's my problem?  Yeah, I gotta
problem.  I gotta big problem with
any trigger-happy madman who
almost gets me shot!

MR. BLONDE
What're you talkin about?

MR. WHITE
That fuckin shooting spree in the
store.

MR. BLONDE
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm,
they deserve what they got.

MR. WHITE
You almost killed me, asshole!  If
I had any idea what type of guy
you were, I never would've agreed
to work with you.

MR. BLONDE
You gonna back all day, little
doggie, or are you gonna bite?

MR. WHITE
What was that?  I'm sorry, I
didn't catch it.  Would you repeat
it?

MR. BLONDE
(slowly)
I said: "Are you gonna bark all
day, dog, or are you gonna bite."

MR. PINK
Both of you two assholes knock it
the fuck off and calm down!

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Blonde)
So you wanna git bit, huh?

MR. PINK
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a
fuckin playground!
(pause)
I don't believe this shit, both of
you got ten years on me, and I'm
the only one actin like a
professional.  You guys act like a
bunch of fuckin niggers.  You ever
work a job with a bunch of
niggers?  They're just like you
two, always fightin, always sayin
they're gonna kill one another.

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Pink)
You said yourself, you
thought about takin him out.

MR. PINK
Then.  That time has passed.
Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only
one I completely trust.  He's too
fuckin homicidal to be workin with
the cops.

MR. WHITE
You takin his side?

MR. PINK
Fuck sides!  What we need is a
little solidarity here.
Somebody's stickin a red hot poker
up our asses and we gotta find out
whose hand's on the handle.  Now I
know I'm no piece of shit...
(referring to Mr.
White)
And I'm pretty sure you're a good
boy...
(referring to Mr.
Blonde)
And I'm fuckin positive you're on
the level.  So let's figure out
who's the bad guy.

Mr. White calms down and puts his gun away.

Mr. Blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning,
talking about Madonna.

MR. BLONDE
Well, that was sure exciting.
(to Mr. White)
You're a big Lee Marvin fan,
aren't you?  Me too.  I don't know
about the rest of you fellas, but
my heart's
beatin fast.
(pause for a beat)
Okay you guys, follow me.

Mr. Blonde hops out of his chair and heads for the door.

The other two men just follow him with their eyes.

MR. WHITE
Follow you where?

MR. BLONDE
Down to my car.

MR. WHITE
Why?

MR. BLONDE
It's a surprise.

Mr. Blonde walks out.


13     EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

Three cars are parked out front.  Mr. Blonde is walking
towards the car he drove.  Mr. White and Mr. Pink are
walking behind.  The Camera is HANDHELD following behind
them.

MR. PINK
We still gotta get out of here.

MR. BLONDE
We're gonna sit here and wait.

MR. WHITE
For what, the cops?

MR. BLONDE
Nice Guy Eddie.

MR. PINK
Nice Guy Eddie?  What makes you
think Nice Guy's anywhere but on a
plane half way to Costa Rica?

MR. BLONDE
Cause I just talked to him.  He's
on his way down here, and nobody's
going anywhere till be gets here.

MR. WHITE
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie?  Why
the fuck didn't you say that in
the first place?

MR. BLONDE
You didn't ask.

MR. WHITE
Hardy-fuckin-har.  What did he
say?

MR. BLONDE
Stay put.  Okay, fellas, take a
look at the little surprise I
brought you.

Mr. Blonde opens up the truck of his car.  A handcuffed,
uniformed POLICEMAN is curled up inside the trunk.

MR. BLONDE
So while we're waitin for Nice Guy
Eddie, what say we have a little
fun finding out who the rat is.


INSERT: TITLE CARD "MR. BLONDE".


14     INT. JOE CABOT'S OFFICE - DAY

We're inside the office of Joe Cabot.  Joe's on the phone,
sitting behind his desk.

JOE
(into phone)
Sid, I'm tellin you don't worry
about it.  You had a bad couple of
months, it happens.
(pause)
Sid, Sid, Sid...Stop, you're
embarrassing me.  I don't need to
be told what I already know.  When
you have bad months, you do what
every business man in the
worlds does, I don't care if he's
Donald Trump or Irving the tailor.
Ya ride it out.

There's a KNOCK on Cabot's office door.

JOE
Come in.

One of Cabot's goons, TEDDY, opens the door and steps
inside.  Cabot covers the receiver with his hand and looks
towards the man.

TEDDY
Vic Vega's outside.

JOE
Tell him to come in.

Teddy leaves.

JOE
(into phone)
Sid, a friend of mine's here.  I
gotta go.
(pause)
Good enough, bye.

He hangs up the phone, stands, and walks around to the
front of the desk.

Teddy opens the office door, and TOOTHPICK VIC VEGA walks
in.

Toothpick Vic Vega is none other than our very own Mr.
Blonde.  Vic is dressed in a long black leather seventies
style jacket.

Joe stands in front of his desk with his arms open.

The two men embrace each other.  Teddy leaves, closing the
door behind him.

JOE
How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin
good, ain't it?

VIC
It's a change.

JOE
Ain't that a sad truth.  Remy
Martin?

VIC
Sure.

JOE
Take a seat.

Joe goes over to his liquor cabinet.  Vic sits in a chair
set in front of Joe's desk.

JOE
(while he pours the
drink)
Who's your parole officer?

VIC
A guy named Koons.  Craig Koons.

JOE
How is he?

VIC
Fuckin asshole, won't let me leave
the halfway house.

JOE
Never ceases to amaze me.  Fuckin
jungle bunny goes out there, slits
some old woman's throat for
twenty-five cents.  Fuckin nigger
gets Doris Day as a parole
officer.  But a good fella like
you gets stuck with a ball-bustin
prick.

Joe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair.

Vic swallows some Remy.

VIC
I just want you to know, Joe, how
much I appreciate your care
packages on the inside.

JOE
What the hell did you expect me to
do?  Just forget about you?

VIC
I just wanted you to know, they
meant a lot.

JOE
It's the least I could do Vic.  I
wish I coulda done more.
(Joe flashes a side
grin at Vic)
Vic. Toothpick Vic.  Tell me a
story?  What're your plans?

VIC
Well, what I wanna do is go back
to work.  But I got this Koons
prick deep up my ass.  He won't
let me leave the halfway house
till I get some piece of shit job.
My plans have always been to be
part of the team again.

There's a KNOCK at the door.

JOE
Come in.

The door opens and in walks Joe's son, Nice Guy Eddie.
Vic turns around in his seat and sees him.

EDDIE
(to Vic)
I see ya sittin here, but I don't
believe it.

Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie.

EDDIE
How ya doin, Toothpick?

VIC
Fine, now.

EDDIE
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked
you up personally at the pen.
This whole week's just been crazy.
I've had my head up my ass the
entire time.

VIC
Funny you should mention it.
That's what your father and I been
talkin about.

EDDIE
That I should've picked you up?

VIC
No.  That your head's been up your
ass.  I walk through the door and
Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank
god.  Finally somebody who knows
what the fuck he's doing.  Vic,
Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck
up."  And I say "Well, Joe, I
coulda told you that."  "I'm
ruined!  He's ruining me!  My son,
I love him, but he's taking my
business and flushing it down the
fuckin toilet!"
(to Joe)
I'm not tellin tales out of
school.  You tell 'im Joe.
Tell 'im yourself.

JOE
Eddie, I hate like hell for you to
hear it this way.  But when Vic
asked me how's business, well, you
don't lie to a man who's just done
four years in the slammer for ya.

Eddie bobs his head up and down.

EDDIE
Oh really, is that a fact?

Eddie JUMPS Vic and they fall to the floor.

The two friends, laughing and cussing at each other,
wrestle on the floor of Joe's office.

Joe's on his feet yelling at them.

JOE
(yelling)
Okay, okay, enough, enough!
Playtime's over!  You wanna roll
around on the floor, do it in
Eddie's office, not mine!

The two men break it up.  They are completely disheveled,
hair a mess, shirttails out.  As they get themselves
together, they continue to taunt one another.

EDDIE
Daddy, did ya see that?

JOE
What?

EDDIE
Guy got me on the ground, tried to
fuck me.

VIC
You fuckin wish.

EDDIE
You tried to fuck me in my
father's office, you sick bastard.
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do
in the privacy of your own home,
go do it.  But don't try to fuck
me.  I don't think of you that
way.  I mean, I like you a lot--

VIC
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I
wouldn't throw you to the crew.

EDDIE
No, you'd keep me for yourself.
Four years fuckin punks in the ass
made you appreciate prime rib when
you get it.

VIC
I might break you, Nice Guy, but
I'd make you my dog's bitch.
You'd be suckin the dick and going
down on a mangy T-bone hound.

EDDIE
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy,
walks into jail a white man, walks
out talkin like a nigger.  It's
all that black semen been shootin
up his butt.  It's backed up into
his brain and comes out of his
mouth.

JOE
Are you two finished?  We were
talkin about some serious shit
when you came in Eddie.  We got a
big problem we're tryin to solve.
Now Eddie, would you like to sit
down and help us solve it, or do
you two wanna piss fart around?

Playtime is over and Vic and Eddie know it.  So they both
take seats in front of Joe's desk.

JOE
Now Vic was tellin me, he's got a
parole problem.

EDDIE
Really?  Who's your P.O.?

VIC
Craig Koons.

EDDIE
Koons?  Oh shit, I hear he's a
motherfucker.

VIC
He is a motherfucker.  He won't
let me leave the halfway house
till I get some piece of shit job.

EDDIE
You're coming back to work for us,
right?

VIC
I wanna.  But I gotta show this
asshole I got an honest-to-
goodness job before he'll let me
move out on my own.  I can't work
for you guys and be worried about
gettin back before ten o'clock
curfew.

JOE
(to Eddie)
We can work this out, can't we?

EDDIE
This isn't all that bad.  We can
give you a lot of legitimate jobs.
Put you on the rotation at Long
Beach as a dock worker.

VIC
I don't wanna lift crates.

EDDIE
You don't hafta lift shit.  You
don't really work there.  But as
far as the records are concerned,
you do.  I call up Matthews, the
foreman, tell him he's got a new
guy.  You're on the schedule.  You
got a timecard, it's clocked in
and out for you everyday, and you
get a pay check at the end of the
week.  And ya know dock workers
don't do too bad.  So you can move
into a halfway decent place
without Koons thinkin "what the
fuck."  And if Koons ever wants to
make a surprise visit, you're gone
that day.  That day we sent you to
Tustin.  We gotta bunch of shit
you needed to unload there.
You're at the Taft airstrip pickin
up a bunch of shit and bringing it
back.  Part of your jab is goin
different places - and we got
places all over the place.

JOE
(to Vic)
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?
(to Eddie)
Vic was worried.

EDDIE
Me and you'll drive down to Long
Beach tomorrow.  I'll introduce
you to Matthews, tell him what's
going on.

VIC
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.
(pause)
When do you think you'll need me
for real work?

JOE
Well, it's kinda a strange time
right now.  Things are kinda--

EDDIE
--Nuts.  We got a big meeting in
Vegas coming up.  And we're kinda
just gettin ready for that right
now.

JOE
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long
Beach.  Give ya some cash, get
that Koons fuck off your back, and
we'll be talking to ya.

EDDIE
Daddy, I got an idea.  Now just
hear it out.  I know you don't
like to use any of the boys on
these jobs, but technically, Vic
ain't one of the boys.  He's been
gone for four years.  He ain't on
no one's list.  Ya know he can
handle himself, ya know you can
trust him.

Joe looks at Vic.

Vic has no idea what they're talking about.

JOE
How would you feel about pullin a
heist with about five other guys?

VIC
What's the exposure like?

JOE
Two minutes, tops.  It's a tough
two minutes.  It's a hold up,
daylight, during business hours,
dealing with a crowd.  But you
have the fellas to deal with the
crowd.  It's a jewelry store.
They're getting a big shipment of
South African diamonds on a
certain day.  They're like a way
station.  It's gonna get picked up
the next day and sent to Hamburg.
When you walk through the door,
you'll know right where to go for
the rich stones.
The fellas are good, me and Nice
Guy picked em.  Nobody knows
anybody else.  Nobody's connected.
I don't use connected guys for
this shit.

VIC
What's the cut?

JOE
Juicy, man, real juicy.

Toothpick Vic smiles.

So does Nice Guy Eddie.

CUT TO:


15     INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Nice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous talking on his
portable car phone.  The sounds of the seventies are
coming out of his car radio in the form of "Love Goes
Where My Rosemary Goes" by Edison Lighthouse.

EDDIE
(into phone)
Hey Dov, we got a major situation
here.
(pause)
I know you know that.  I gotta
talk with daddy and find out what
he wants done.


FLASH ON

16     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The Cop is standing in the warehouse with his hands cuffed
behind his back.  Mr. White, Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde
surround him and proceed to beat the shit out of him.
"Love Grows .." PLAYS over the soundtrack.


17     BACK TO NICE GUY EDDIE

EDDIE
(into phone)
All I know is what Vic told me.
He said the place turned into a
fuckin bullet festival.  He took a
cop as hostage, just to get the
fuck out of there.


FLASH ON

18     WAREHOUSE

The three men are stomping the cop into the ground.


19     BACK TO EDDIE

EDDIE
(into phone)
Do I sound like I'm jokin?  He's
fuckin driving around with the cop
in his trunk.
(pause)
I don't know who did that.  I
don't know who has the loot, if
anybody has the loot.  Who's dead,
who's alive, who's caught, who's
not...
I will know, I'm practically
there.  But what do I tell these
guys about daddy?
(pause)
You sure that's what he said?
(pause)
Okay, that's what I'll tell em.

CUT TO:


20     EXT.  WAREHOUSE - DAY

Three cars belonging to the other guys are parked outside
the warehouse.

Eddie drives his car up to the warehouse.  He gets out of
the car, looks at the other cars parked outside.

EDDIE
(to himself)
Fucking assholes.

Eddie makes a beeline for the front door, BANGS it open,
and steps inside the warehouse.


21     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The robbers have the cop tied to a chair and are still
WAILING on him.

Nice Guy Eddie walks in and everybody jumps.

EDDIE
What in Sam Hill is goin on?

Mr. Pink and Mr. White speak together.

MR. PINK                      MR. WHITE
Hey, Nice Guy, we got a     You're askin what's goin
cop.                        on?  Where the fuck is
Joe?

Nice Guy sees Mr. Orange.

EDDIE
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked
up!

MR. WHITE
No shit, he's gonna fuckin die on
us if we don't get him taken care
of.

MR. PINK
We were set up, the cops were
waiting for us.

EDDIE
What?  Nobody set anybody up.

MR. PINK
The cops were there waitin for us!

EDDIE
Bullshit.

MR. PINK
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't
there, we were.  And I'm tellin
ya, the cops had that store staked
out.

EDDIE
Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?

MR. PINK
What the fuck d'you think we've
been askin each other?

EDDIE
And what are your answers?  Was it
me?  You think I set you up?

MR. PINK
I don't know, but somebody did.

EDDIE
Nobody did.  You assholes turn the
jewelry store into a wild west
show, and you wonder why cops show
up.

MR. BLONDE
Where's Joseph?

EDDIE
I ain't talked to him.  I talked
to Dov.  Dov said he's comin out
here, and he's fucking pissed.

MR. PINK
(to Mr. White)
I told ya he'd be pissed.

MR. WHITE
(pointing to Mr.
Orange)
What are you gonna do about him?

EDDIE
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin
chance to breathe.  I got a few
questions of my own, ya know.

MR. WHITE
You ain't dying, he is.

EDDIE
I'll call somebody.

MR. WHITE
Who?

EDDIE
A snake charmer, what the fuck
d'you think.  I'll call a doctor,
take care of him, fix 'm right up.
No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr.
Blue?

MR. PINK
Brown's dead, we don't know about
Blue.

EDDIE
Nobody saw what happened to Mr.
Blue?

MR. BLONDE
Well, he's either dead or he's
alive or the cops got him or they
don't.

DOLLY to MEDIUM on the cop.

EDDIE (OS)
I take it this is the bastard you
told me about.
(referring to the
cop)
Why the hell are you beating on
him?

MR. PINK
So he'll tell us who the fuck set
us up.

EDDIE
Would you stop it with that shit!
You beat on this prick enough,
he'll tell ya he started the
Chicago fire.  That don't
necessarily make it so.  Okay,
first things fucking last, where's
the shit?  Please tell me somebody
brought something
with them.

MR. PINK
I got a bag.  I stashed it till I
could be sure this place wasn't a
police station.

EDDIE
Well, let's go get it.  We also
gotta get rid of all those cars.
It looks like Sam's hot car lot
outside.
(pointing to Mr.
Blonde)
You stay here and babysit Orange
and the cop.
(referring to Mr.
Pink and Mr. White)
You two take a car each, I'll
follow ya.  You ditch it, I'll
pick you up, then we'll pick up
the stones.  And while I'm
following you, I'll arrange for
some sort of a doctor for our
friend.

MR. WHITE
We can't leave these guys with
him.

Meaning Mr. Blonde.

EDDIE
Why not?

Mr. White crosses to Mr. Blonde.

MR. WHITE
Because this guy's a fucking
psycho.  And if you think
Joe's pissed at us, that
ain't nothing compared to how
pissed off I am at him, for puttin
me in the same room as this
bastard.

MR. BLONDE
(to Eddie)
You see what I been puttin up
with?  As soon as I walk through
the door I'm hit with this shit.
I tell 'm what you told me about
us stayin put and Mr. White whips
out his gun, sticks it in my face,
and starts screaming "You
motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you
away, blah, blah, blah."

MR. WHITE
He's the reason the place turned
into a shooting gallery.
(to Mr. Pink)
What are you, a silent partner?
Fuckin tell him.

MR. PINK
He seems all right now, but he
went crazy in the store.

MR. WHITE
This is what he was doin.

Mr. White acts out Mr. Blonde shooting everybody in the
store.

MR. BLONDE
I told 'em not to touch the alarm.
They touched it.  I blew 'em full
of holes.  If they hadn't done
what I told 'em not it, they'd
still be alive.

MR. WHITE
That's your excuse for going on a
kill crazy rampage?

MR. BLONDE
I don't like alarms.

EDDIE
What does it matter who stays with
the cop?  We ain't lettin him go.
Not after he's seen everybody.
You should've never took him outta
your trunk in the first place.

MR. PINK
We were trying to find out what he
knew about the set up.

EDDIE
There is no fuckin set up!
(Eddie takes charge)
Look, this is the news.  Blondie,
you stay here and take care of
them two.  White and Pink come
with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and
sees all those fucking cars
parked out front, he's going to be
as mad at me as he is at you.

Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse
talking amongst themselves.


22     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MR. BLONDE AND COP

Mr. Blonde closes the door after them.  He then slowly
turns his head towards the cop.

MR. BLONDE
Alone at last.


C.U. COP'S FACE.

MR. BLONDE (OS)
Now where were we?

COP
I told you I don't know anything
about any fucking set up.  I've
only been on the force eight
months, nobody tells me anything!
I don't know anything!  You can
torture me if you want--

MR. BLONDE (OS)
--Thanks, don't mind if I do.

COP
Your boss even said there wasn't a
set up.

MR. BLONDE (OS)
First off, I don't have a boss.
Are you clear about that?

He SLAPS the cop's face.

MR. BLONDE (OS)
I asked you a question.  Are you
clear about that?

COP
Yes.

MR. BLONDE (OS)
Now I'm not gonna bullshit you.  I
don't really care about what you
know or don't know.  I'm gonna
torture you for awhile regardless.
Not to get information, but
because torturing a cop amuses me.
There's nothing you can say,
there's nothing you can do.
Except pray for death.

He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth.


COP'S POV

Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop.

MR. BLONDE
Let's see what's on K-BILLY'S
"super sounds of the seventies"
weekend.

He turns on the radio.

Stealer's Wheel's hit "Stuck in the Middle with You" PLAYS
over the speaker.

NOTE: This entire sequence is timed to the music.

Mr. Blonde slowly walks toward the cop.

He opens a large knife.

He grabs a chair, places it in front of the cop and sits
in it.

Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's our face, holding
the knife, singing along with the song.

Then, like a cobra, he LASHES out.

A SLASH across the face.

The cop camera moves around wildly.

Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's our face, singing
along with the seventies hit.

Then he reaches out and CUTS OFF the cop's our ear.

The cop camera moves around wildly.

Mr. Blonde holds the ear up to the cop us to see.

Mr. Blonde rises, kicking the chair he was sitting on out
of the way.


23     INT. EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - HANDHELD SHOT

We follow Mr Blonde as he walks out of the warehouse...

...to his car.  He opens the trunk, pulls out a large can
of gasoline.

He walks back inside the warehouse...


24     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

...carrying the can of gas.

Mr. Blonde POURS the gasoline all over the cop, who's
BEGGING him not to do this.

Mr. Blonde just sings along with Stealer's Wheel.

Mr. Blonde LIGHTS up a match and, while mouthing:

MR. BLONDE
"Clowns to the left of me,
Jokers to the right.  Here I am,
stuck in the middle with you."

He moves the match up to the cop...

...When a bullet EXPLODES in Mr. Blonde's chest.

The HANDHELD camera WHIPS to the right and we see the
bloody Mr. Orange FIRING his gun.

We cut back and forth between Mr. Blonde taking BULLET
HITS and Mr. Orange emptying his weapon.

Mr. Blonde FALLS down dead.

Mr. Orange crawls to where the cop is, leaving a bloody
trail behind him.

When he reaches the cop's feet he looks up at him.

MR. ORANGE
(feebly)
What's your name?

COP
Jeffrey.

MR. ORANGE
Jeffrey what?

COP
Jeffrey Andrews.

MR. ORANGE
Listen to me, Jeffrey
Andrews.  I'm a cop.

JEFFREY
I know.

MR. ORANGE
(surprised)
You do?

JEFFREY
Your name's Freddy something.

MR. ORANGE
Freddy Newendyke.

JEFFREY
Frankie Ferchetti introduced us
once, about five months ago.

MR. ORANGE
Shit.  I don't remember that at
all.

JEFFREY
I do.
(pause)
How do I look?

The gun-shot Mr. Orange looks at the kid's GASHED face and
the hole in the side of his head where his ear used to be.

MR. ORANGE
I don't know what to tell you
Jeffrey.

Jeffrey starts to weep.

JEFFREY
That fucking bastard!  That
fucking sick fucking bastard!

MR. ORANGE
Jeffrey, I need you to hold on.
There's officers positioned and
waiting to move in a block away.

JEFFREY
(screaming)
What the fuck are they waiting
for?  That motherfucker cut off my
ear!  He slashed my face!  I'm
deformed!

MR. ORANGE
And I'm dying.  They don't know
that.  All they know is they're
not to make a move until Joe Cabot
shows up.  I was sent undercover
to get Cabot.  You heard 'em, they
said he's on his way.  Don't pussy
out on me now, Jeffrey.  We're
just gonna sit here and bleed
until Joe
Cabot sticks his fuckin head
through that door.

INSERT: TITLE CARD  "MR. ORANGE   MR. WHITE"


25     INT.  DENNY'S - NIGHT

A tough-looking black man named HOLDAWAY, who sports a
Malcom X beard, a green Chairman Mao cap with a red star
on it, and a military flack jacket, digs into a Denny
bacon, cheese and avocado burger.  He sits in a booth all
alone.  He's waiting for somebody.  As he waits, he
practically empties an entire bottle of ketchup on his
french fries, not by mistake either--that's just how he
likes it.

We see Mr. Orange, now known as FREDDY NEWENDYKE, wearing
a high school letterman jacket, enter the coffee shop,
spot Holdaway, and head his way.  Holdaway sees Freddy bop
towards him with a wide-ass alligator grin plastered
across his face.

CAMERA DOLLIES FAST down AISLE to MEDIUM SHOT of Holdaway.
We fear Freddy OFF SCREEN.

FREDDY (O.S.)
Say "hello" to a motherfucker
who's inside.  Cabot's doing a job
and take a big fat guess who he
wants on the team?

HOLDAWAY
This better not be some Freddy
joke.

LOW ANGLE

looking up at Freddy, who's standing at the table.

FREDDY
It ain't no joke, I'm in there.
I'm up his ass.

CU ON HOLDAWAY

Holdaway just looks at his pupil for a moment, then
smiles.

HOLDAWAY
Congratulations.


26     EXT.  DENNY'S - NIGHT

We see through the window of the restaurant Freddy slide
into the booth across from Holdaway.  Freddy's doing a lot
of talking, but we can't hear what they're saying.


27     INT.  DENNY'S - NIGHT

FREEZE FRAME ON HOLDAWAY

We are frozen on a MEDIUM CU of Holdaway listening to
Freddy.  We HEAR RESTAURANT NOISE and Freddy OFF SCREEN.

FREDDY (O.S.)
Nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants
to meet me.  He says I should just
hang around my apartment and wait
for a phone call.  Well after
waiting three goddamn days by the
fuckin phone, he calls me last
night and says Joe's ready, and
he'll pick me up in fifteen
minutes.

The freeze frame ENDS.  Holdaway comes suddenly up to
speed and says:

HOLDAWAY
Woo all picked you up?

From here to end we cut back and forth.

FREDDY
Nice Guy.  When we got to the
bar...

HOLDAWAY
...What bar?

FREDDY
The Boots and Socks in Gardena.
When we got there, I met Joe and a
guy named Mr. White.  It's a phony
name.  My name's Mr. Orange.

HOLDAWAY
You ever seen this motherfucker
before?

FREDDY
Who, Mr. White?

HOLDAWAY
Yeah.

FREDDY
No, he ain't familiar.  He ain't
one of Cabot's soldiers either.
He's gotta be from outta town.
But Joe knows him real well.

HOLDAWAY
How can you tell?

FREDDY
The way they talk to each other.
You can tell they're buddies.

HOLDAWAY
Did the two of you talk?

FREDDY
Me and Mr. White?

HOLDAWAY
Yeah.

FREDDY
A little.

HOLDAWAY
What about?

FREDDY
The Brewers.

HOLDAWAY
The Milwaukee Brewers?

FREDDY
Yeah.  They had just won the night
before, and he made a killing off
'em.

HOLDAWAY
Well, if this crook's a Brewers
fan, his ass has gotta be from
Wisconsin.  And I'll bet you
everything from a diddle-eyed Joe
to a damned-if-I-know, that in
Milwaukee they got a sheet on this
Mr. White motherfucker's ass.  I
want you to go through the mugs of
guys from old Milwaukee with a
history of armed robbery, and put
a name to that face.

Holdaway takes a big bite out of his burger.

HOLDAWAY
(with his mouth full)
What kinds questions did Cabot
ask?

FREDDY
Where I was from, who I knew, how
I knew Nice Guy, had I done time,
shit like that.

Holdaway's talked enough, he's eating his burger now.  He
motions for Freddy to elaborate.

FREDDY
He asked me if I ever done armed
robbery before.  I read him my
credits.  I robbed a few gas and
sips, sold some weed, told him
recently I held the shotgun while
me and another guy pulled down a
poker game in Portland.

CAMERA MOVES from a MEDIUM on Freddy to a CU.

HOLDAWAY (O.S.)
Didja use the commode story?

FREDDY
Fuckin-A.  I tell it real good,
too.


28     INT.  MEN'S ROOM - L.A. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

Freddy and Holdaway at one of their many rendezvous.
Holdaway wears an extra large Lakers sweatshirt.  Freddy
sits on one of the sinks, wearing his high school jacket,
looking at pieces of paper stapled together.

FREDDY
What's this?

HOLDAWAY
It's a scene.  Memorize it.

FREDDY
What?

HOLDAWAY
A undercover cop has got to be
Marlon Brando.  To do this job you
got to be a great actor.  You got
to be naturalistic.  You got to be
naturalistic as hell.  If you
ain't a great actor you're a bad
actor, and bad acting is bull shit
in this job.

FREDDY
(referring to the
papers)
But what is this?

HOLDAWAY
It's a amusing anecdote about a
drug deal.

FREDDY
What?

HOLDAWAY
Something funny that happened to
you while you were doing a job.

FREDDY
I gotta memorize all this shit?

HOLDAWAY
It's like a joke.  You remember
what's important, and the rest you
make your own.  The only way to
make it your own is to keep sayin
it, and sayin it, and sayin it,
and sayin it, and sayin it.

FREDDY
I can do that.

HOLDAWAY
The things you gotta remember are
the details.  It's the details
that sell your story.  Now this
story takes place in this men's
room.  So you gotta know the
details about this men's room.
You gotta know they got a blower
instead of a towel to dry your
hands.  You gotta know the stalls
ain't got no doors.  You gotta
know whether they got liquid or
powdered soap, whether they got
hot water or not, 'cause if you do
your job when you tell your story,
everybody should believe it.  And
if you tell your story to somebody
who's actually taken a piss in
this men's room, and you get one
detail they remember right,
they'll swear by you.


29     INT.  FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame,
rehearsing the anecdote.  He's reading it pretty good, but
he's still reading it from the page, and every once in a
while he stumbles over his words.

FREDDY
...this was during the Los Angeles
marijuana drought of '86.  I still
had a connection.  Which was
insane, 'cause you couldn't get
weed anyfuckinwhere then.  Anyway,
I had a connection with this
hippie chick up in Santa Cruz.
All and my friends knew it.  And
they'd give me a call and say,
"Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you
think you could buy me some too?"
They knew I smoked, so they'd ask
me to buy a little for them when I
was buyin.  But it got to be
everytime I bought some weed, I
was buyin for four or five
different people.  Finally I said,
"Fuck this shit."  I'm makin this
bitch rich.  She didn't have to do
jack shit, she never even had to
meet these people.  I was fuckin
doin all the work.  So I got
together with her and told her,
"Hey, I'm sick of this shit.  I'm
comin through for everybody, and
nobody's comin through for me.
So, either I'm gonna tell all my
friends to find their own source,
or you give me a bunch of weed,
I'll sell it to them, give you the
money, minus ten percent, and I
get my pot for free."  So, I did
if for awhile...

Freddy exits frame

CUT TO:


30     EXT.  PARKING LOT - DAY

Another empty frame, except obviously outside.  Freddy
enters frame from the same direction he exited in the
previous scene, finishing his sentence.  When we move to a
wider shot we see Freddy performing his monolog to
Holdaway in a parking lot.  Holdaway sits on the hood of
his beat-up car.  Freddy paces back and forth as he
performs his story.

FREDDY
...but then that got to be a pain
in the ass.  People called me on
the phone all the fuckin time.  I
couldn't rent a fuckin tape
without six phone calls
interrupting me.  "Hey, Freddy,
when's the next time you're gettin
some?"  "Motherfucker, I'm tryin
to watch 'Lost Boys'-- when I have
some, I'll let you know."  And
then these rinky-dink pot heads
come by--there's my friends and
everything, but still.  I got all
my shit laid out in sixty dollar
bags.  Well, they don't want sixty
dollars worth.  They want ten
dollars worth.  Breaking it up is
a major fuckin pain in the ass.  I
don't even know how much ten
dollars worth is.  "Well, fuck,
man, I don't want that much
around.  If I have that much
around I'll smoke it."  "Hey, if
you guys can't control your
smokin, that's not my problem.
You motherfuckers been smokin for
five years, be a adult about it."
Finally I just told my connection,
count me out.  But as it turns
out, I'm the best guy she had, and
she depended alot on my business.
But I was still sick to death of
it.  And she's trying to talk me
into not quitin.
Now this was a very weird
situation, 'cause I don't know if
you remember back in '86, there
was a major fuckin drought.
Nobody and anything.  People were
livin on resin and smokin the wood
in their pipes for months.  And
this chick had a bunch, and was
beggin me to sell it.  So I told
her I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot
Man anymore.  But I would take a
little bit and sell it to my
close, close, close friends.  She
agreed to that, and said we'd keep
the same arrangement as before,
ten percent and free pot for me,
as long as I helped her out that
weekend.  She had a brick of weed
she was sellin, and she didn't
want to go to the buy alone...

CUT TO:


31     INT.  BOOTS AND SOCKS BAR - NIGHT

Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White all sit around a
table in a red-lighted smokey bar.  Freddy continues his
story.  The crooks are enjoying the hell out of it.

FREDDY
...Her brother usually goes with
her, but he's in county
unexpectedly.

MR. WHITE
What for?

FREDDY
Traffic tickets gone to warrant.
They stopped him for something,
found the warrants on 'im, took
'im to jail.  She doesn't want to
walk around alone with all that
weed.  Well, I don't wanna do
this, I have a bad feeling about
it, but she keeps askin me, keeps
askin me, finally I said okay
'cause I'm sick of listening to
it.  Well, we're picking this guy
up at the train station.

JOE
You're picking the buyer up at the
train station?  You're carrying
the weed on you?

FREDDY
Yeah, the guy needed it right
away.  Don't ask me why.  So we
get to the train station, and
we're waitin for the guy.  Now I'm
carrying the weed in one of those
carry-on bags, and I gotta take a
piss.  So I tell the connection
I'll be right back, I'm goin' to
the little boys room...

CUT TO:


32     INT.  MEN'S ROOM - TRAIN STATION - DAY

MEDIUM ON FREDDY

He walks through the door with a carry-on bag over his
shoulder.  Once he's inside, he stops in his tracks.  We
move into a CU.

FREDDY (V.O.)
...So I walk into the men's room,
and who's standing there?

FREEZE FRAME

on Freddy standing in front of six Los Angeles County
Sheriffs and one German Shepherd.  All of their eyes are
on Freddy.  Everyone is frozen.

FREDDY (V.O.)
...six Los Angeles County Sheriffs
and a German Shepherd.

NICE GUY EDDIE (V.O.)
They were waiting for you?

FREDDY (V.O.)
No.  They were just a bunch of
cops hangin out in the men's room,
talkin.  When I walked through the
door they all stopped what they
were talking about and looked at
me.

MR. WHITE
That's hard, man.  That's a fuckin

barking his head off.

FREDDY (V.O.)
The German Shepherd starts
barkin'.  He's barkin' at me.  I
mean it's obvious he's barkin' at
me.

We do a slow 360 around Freddy in the men's room.  We can
hear the dog barking.

FREDDY (V.O.)
Every nerve ending, all of my
senses, the blood in my veins,
everything I has was screaming,
"Take off, man, just take off, get
the fuck outta there!"  Panic hit
me like a bucket of water.  First
there was the shock of it--BAM,
right in the face!  Then I'm just
standin there drenched in panic.

SLOW MOTION

CAMERA does a PAN from face to face of the sheriffs.

FREDDY (V.O.)
And all those sheriffs are lookin
at me and they know. They can
smell it.  As sure as that fuckin
dog cam, they can smell it on me.

FREEZE FRAME

Back to the same freeze frame shot of Freddy standing in
front of the sheriffs.  It suddenly jerks to life, and
moves to speed.  The dog is barking.  Freddy moves to his
right, out of frame.  We stay on the sheriffs.  One
sheriff yells at the dog.

SHERIFF  1
Shut up!

The dog quiets down.  Sheriff  2 continues with his story.
A couple of the sheriffs look over at Freddy off screen,
but as Sheriff  2 talks, turn their attention to him.

SHERIFF  2
So my gun's drawn, right?  I got
it aimed right at him.  I tell
'em, "Freeze, don't fuckin move."
And the little idiot's lookin at
me, nodding his head "Yes," sayin
"I know...I know...I know."
Meanwhile his right hand is
creepin towards his glove box.  So
I scream at him, "Asshole, you
better fuckin freeze right now!"
And he's still lookin right at me,
saying
"I know...I know...I know."  And
his right hand's still going for
the glove box.

The CAMERA PANS away from the sheriffs to Freddy, up
against the urinal, playing possum, pretending to piss.

SHERIFF  2 (O.S.)
I tell 'im, "Buddy, I'm gonna
shoot you in the face right now if
you don't put your hands on the
fuckin dash."  And the guy's
girlfriend, a real sexy Oriental
bitch, starts screamin at him,
"Chuck, are you out of your mind?
Put your hands on the dash like
the officer said."  And then like
nothing, the guy snaps out of it
and casually puts his hands on the
dash.

Freddy finishes his playing possum piss, and walks past
the sheriffs over to the sink.  The CAMERA PANS with him.
A sheriff is sitting on a sink.  He looks down and watches
Freddy wash his hands.

SHERIFF  1
What was he goin for?

SHERIFF  2
His registration.  Stupid fuckin
citizen, doesn't have the
slightest idea how close he came
to gettin shot.

Freddy finishes washing his hands.  He goes to dry them,
but there's only those hand drying machines.  Freddy turns
on the drying machine.  He can't hear anything the
sheriffs say now.  The sound of the machine dominates the
sound track.

These following shots are SLOW MOTION.

Dimick!


C.U. OF COMPUTER PRINTER

printing out sheet.  The noise of the printer plays loud
over the soundtrack. Jodie's hand comes into FRAME and
tears sheet from the printer.

CUT TO:


36     INT. HOLDAWAY'S OFFICE - DAY

Holdaway sits behind his desk.  Freddy sits on the edge of
the desk eating a Double-Double with cheese.  They look
into the CAMERA.

We hear Jodie's voice OFFSCREEN.

JODIE (OS)
Lawrence "Larry" Dimick.  Also
known as Lawrence Jacobs and Alvin
"Al" Jacobs.  This guy is Mr. Joe-
Armed-Robbery.  He's
a pro and he makes it a habit not
to get caught.


MEDIUM SHOT OF JODIE

DOLLY slowly into C.U.

JODIE
He's only been convicted twice,
which is pretty good for somebody
living a life of crime.  Once for
armed robbery, when he was twenty-
one, in Milwaukee.


C.U. FREDDY

FREDDY
What was it?


JODIE

JODIE
Payroll office at a lumber yard.
First offense - he got eighteen
months.  He didn't get busted
again until he was thirty-two.
And then it was a backdoor bust.
A routine vice squad roust.  They
roust this bar, out buddy Lawrence
is in there knocking down a few.
He gets picked up.  He's wearing
on his person an outlaw .45
automatic, apparently his weapon
of choice.  Also, on his finger is
a diamond ring from a jewelry
store robbery a year earlier.  He
got two years back inside for
that.


TWO SHOT OF HOLDAWAY AND FREDDY

Freddy winces.

FREDDY
Goddamn, that's hard time.


JODIE

JODIE
So far, it's the only time he's
ever done.


CU HOLDAWAY

HOLDAWAY
Was this vice squad bullshit in
Milwaukee?


JODIE

JODIE
No.  The vice squad roust was in
L.A.  He's been in Los Angeles
since '77.


DOLLY BEHIND HOLDAWAY'S DESK

from left to right.

FREDDY
When did he do this time?

JODIE
Back in '83, got out late '86.  I
found something else out I think
you two should be aware of.
About a year and a half ago, up in
Sacramento, an undercover cop,
John Dolenz, worked his way into a
bank job.  Apparently before the
job they found out he was a cop.
Now picture this:  It's Dolenz's
birthday, a bunch of cops are
waiting in his apartment for a
surprise party.  The door opens,
everyone yells "Surprise!", and
standing in the doorway is Dolenz
and this other guy sticking a gun
in Dolenz's ribs.  Before anybody
knows what's going on, this
stranger shoots Dolenz dead and
starts firing two .45 automatics
into the crowd.

HOLDAWAY
What happened?

The DOLLY moves behind Jodie.

JODIE
It was a mess.  Cops got hit,
wives got hit, girlfriends got
hit, his dog got hit.  People got
glass in their faces.  Three were
killed, six were wounded.

FREDDY
They couldn't pin the killing on
one of the bank robbers?

JODIE
They tried, but they didn't have a
positive I.D. and all those guys
had alibis.  Besides, we really
didn't have anything on them.  We
had the testimony of a dead man
that they were talking
about committing a robbery.  They
never went ahead with the bank
job.

The DOLLY completes its circle.

FREDDY
And Larry Dimick was one of the
boys?

JODIE
He was probably the one.


ON HOLDAWAY

HOLDAWAY
Just how sure are you with your
cover?

PAN to C.U. on Freddy.

FREDDY
Today they may know something,
tomorrow they may know something
else.  But yesterday they didn't
know anything.


C.U. OF MR. WHITE'S MUG SHOT

FREDDY (OS)
What's the next step?

HOLDAWAY (OS)
Do what they told ya.  Sit in your
apartment and wait for 'em to call
you.  We'll have guys posted
outside who'll follow you when
they pick you up.


35     INT.  FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

C.U. TELEPHONE

It RINGS.  Freddy answers it, we FOLLOW the receiver up to
his face.

FREDDY
Hello.

NICE GUY EDDIE (OS)
(through phone)
It's time.  Grab your jacket--


36     INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY

C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie speaking into the car phone.

EDDIE
--We're parked outside.

FREDDY (OS)
(through phone)
I'll be right down.

We hear the CLICK of Freddy hanging up through the phone.
Nice Guy places the receiver back in its cradle.

EDDIE
He'll be right down.


39     INT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

The CAMERA follows Freddy as he hops around the
apartment getting everything he needs.  He puts on
his jacket and slips on some sneakers.

DOLLY fast toward the front door knob.  Freddy's hand
comes into FRAME, grabs the knob, then lets go.  We MOVE
UP to his face.

Fear.

FREDDY
(to himself)
Don't pussy out on me now.  They
don't know.  They don't know shit.
(pause)
You're not gonna get hurt.  You're
fucking Baretta and they believe
every word, cuz
you're super cool.

He exits FRAME. We stay put and hear the door open and
close OFF SCREEN.


40     EXT. FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

COPS' POV

From inside an unmarked car across the street, the TWO
COPS watching Freddy see him walk out of his building and
up to Eddie's parked car.

COP  1 (OS)
There goes our boy.

COP  2 (OS)
I swear, a guy has to have rocks
in his head the size of Gibraltar
to work undercover.

COP  1 (OS)
Do you want one of these?

COP  2 (OS)
Yeah, gimme the bear claw.

Freddy gets into the car and it pulls into traffic.

Cop  1 starts the engine and follows.


41     INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Nice Guy Eddie is behind the wheel.  Mr. Pink is
in the passenger seat.  Freddy and Mr. White are in the
backseat together.

MR. PINK
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin
about, black women ain't the same
as white women.

MR. WHITE
(sarcastically)
There's a slight difference.

The car laughs.

MR. PINK
Go ahead and laugh, you know what
I mean.  What a while bitch will
put up with, a black bitch won't
put up with for a minute.  They
got a line, and if you cross it,
they fuck you up.

EDDIE
I gotta go along with Mr. Pink on
this.  I've seen it happen.

MR. WHITE
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such
a truism, how come every nigger I
know treats his woman like a piece
of shit?

MR. PINK
I'll make you a bet that those
same damn niggers who were showin
their ass in public, when their
bitches get 'em home, they chill
the fuck out.

MR. WHITE
Not these guys.

MR. PINK
Yeah, those guys too.

EDDIE
Let me tell you guys a story.  In
one of daddy's clubs there was
this black cocktail waitress named
Elois.

MR. WHITE
Elois?

EDDIE
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois.  We
called her Lady E.

MR. WHITE
Where was she from, Compton?

EDDIE
No.  She was from Ladora Heights.

MR. PINK
The black Beverly Hills.  I knew
this lady from Ladora Heights
once.
(in a stuck up black
female voice)
"Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's
the black Beverly Hills."
EDDIE
It's not the black Beverly Hills,
it's the black Palos Verdes.
Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a
man-eater-upper.  I bet every guy
who's ever met her has jacked off
to her at least once.  You know
who she looked like?  Christie
Love.  'Member that TV show "Get
Christie Love"?  She was a black
female cop.  She always used to
say "You're under arrest, sugar."

MR. PINK
I was in the sixth grade when that
show was on.  I totally dug it.
What the fuck was the name of the
chick who played Christie
Love?

EDDIE
Pam Grier.

MR. PINK
No, it wasn't Pan Grier, Pan Grier
was the other one.  Pan Grier made
the movies.  Christie Love was
like a Pam Grier TV show, without
Pam Grier.

MR. PINK
What the fuck was that chick's
name?  Oh this is just great, I'm
totally fuckin tortured now.

EDDIE
Well, whoever she was, Elois
looked like her.  So one night I
walk into the club, and no Elois.
Now the bartender was a wetback,
he was a friend of mine, his name
was Carlos.
So I asked him "Hey, Carlos,
where's Lady E tonight?"  Well
apparently Lady E was married to
this real piece of dog shit.  I
mean a real animal.  And
apparently he would so things to
her.

FREDDY

Do things?  What would he do?  You
mean like beat her up?

EDDIE
Nobody knows for sure what he did.
We just know he did something.
Anyway, Elois plays it real cool.
And waits for the next time this
bag of shit gets drunk.  So one
night the guy gets drunk and
passes out on the couch.  So while
the guy's
inebriated, she strips him naked.
Then she takes some crazy glue and
glues his dick to his belly.

The car reacts to how horrible that would be.

EDDIE
I'm dead fuckin serious.  She put
some on his dick and some on his
belly, then stuck 'em together.
The paramedics had to come and cut
it loose.

The car reacts badly.

MR. WHITE
Jesus Christ!

FREDDY
You can do some crazy things with
it.

EDDIE
I don't know what he did to her,
but she got even.

MR. WHITE
Was he all pissed off?

MR. PINK
How would you feel if you had to
do a handstand every time you took
a piss.

The car laughs.


42     EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

Nice Guy Eddie pulls up outside the warehouse.
The four men climb out of the car and follow Eddie inside.


43     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The four men enter the building.

At the other end of the warehouse, sitting in chairs, are
Mr. Blonde, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue and Joe Cabot.

We shoot this from OVERHEAD, looking down on the men.

JOE
(to everybody)
...So they're talkin about how
they get their wives off, and the
French guys says:
(in a bad French
accent)
"All I gotta do is take my pinky
and tickle my Fifi's little oo la
la  and she rises a foot off the
bed."

Back to Joe.

So the dago says:


CU ON JOE

JOE
(in a good Brooklyn
accent)
"That's nothin.  When I take the
tip of my tongue and wiggle it
against my Mary Louise's little
fun pimple, she rises two feet off
da bed."  Then our friend from
Poland says:
(in dumb voice)
"You guys ain't no cocksmen. When
I get through fuckin my Sophie, I
wipe my dick on the curtains and
you know what?  She hits the
roof!"

Joe laughs like a crazy man.

JOE
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

We hear a lot of laughing OFF SCREEN.

JOE
Ain't that a masterpiece?  Stupid
fuckin Polack, wipes his dick on
the drapes.

Joe's eyes greet the new arrivals.

JOE
You're here, great!

Joe EXITS C.U.

We now have everybody from the Uncle Bob's Pancake House
scene together again.  Some sit on folding chairs, some
stand.  Joe sits in front of them on the edge of a table.
A blackboard with a layout of the jewelry store is off to
the right.

We do a 360 around the men.

EDDIE
We woulda gotten here sooner, but
we got backed up around La Brea
and Pico.

JOE
No hurry.
(to the boys)
All right, let's get to know one
another.  With the exception of
Eddie and myself, who you already
know, you'll be using aliases.
Under no circumstances are you to
tell one another your real name or
anything else about yourself.
That includes where you're from,
your wife's name, where you
might've done time, about a bank
in St. Petersburg you might've
robbed.  You guys don't say shit
about who you are, where you been
or what you've done.  Only thing
you guys can talk about is what
you're going to do.  This way the
only ones who know who the members
of the team are are Eddie and
myself.  And that's the way I like
it.  Because in the unlikely event
of one of you getting apprehended
by the cops, not that I expect
that to happen - it most
definitely should not happen - it
hasn't happened, you don't have
anything to deal with.  You don't
know any names.  You know my name,
you know Eddie's name.  That I
don't care about.  You gotta prove
it.  I ain't worried.  Besides,
this way you gotta trust me.  I
like that.  I set this up and
picked the men I wanted for it.
None of you came to me, I
approached all of you.  I know
you.  I know your work, I know
your reputation.  I know you as
men.  Except for this guy.

Joe points a finger at Freddy.

Freddy shits a brick.

JOE
But he's OK.  If he wasn't OK, he
wouldn't be here.  Okay, let me
introduce everybody to everybody.
But once again, at the risk of
being redundant, if I even think I
hear somebody telling or referring
to somebody by their Christian
name...
(Joe searches for the
right words)
...you won't want to be you.
Okay, quickly.
(pointing at the men
as he gives them a
name)
Mr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde,
Mr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr.
Pink.

MR. PINK
Why am I Mr. Pink?

JOE
Cause you're a faggot.

Everybody laughs.

MR. PINK
Why can't we pick out our own
colors?

JOE
I tried that once, it don't work.
You get four guys fighting over
who's gonna be Mr. Black.  Since
nobody knows anybody else, nobody
wants to back down.  So forget it,
I pick.  Be thankful you're not
Mr. Yellow.

MR. BROWN
Yeah, but Mr. Brown?  That's too
close to Mr. Shit.

Everybody laughs.

MR. PINK
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr.
Pussy.  Tell you what, let me be
Mr. Purple.  That sounds good to
me, I'm Mr. Purple.

JOE
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody
from another job's Mr. Purple.
You're Mr. Pink.

MR. WHITE
Who cares what your name is?  Who
cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr.
Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...

MR. PINK
Oh that's really easy for you to
say, you're Mr. White.  You gotta
cool-sounding name.  So tell me,
Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink"
is no big deal, you wanna trade?

JOE
Nobody's trading with anybody!
Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin
city counsel meeting!  Listen up
Mr. Pink.  We got two ways here,
my way or the highway.  And you
can go down either of 'em.  So
what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?

MR. PINK
Jesus Christ, Joe.  Fuckin forget
it.  This is beneath me.  I'm Mr.
Pink, let's move on.

CAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard
with the layout of the jewelry store on it.

JOE (OS)
Okay fellas, let's get into this.

CUT TO:


44     EXT. BLEACHERS - DAY

Freddy and Holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty
little league baseball field.

HOLDAWAY
Okay, we're gonna station men
across the street from Karina's
Fine Jewelry.  But their orders
will be not to move in unless the
robbery gets out of control.  You
gotta make sure they don't have to
move in.  You're inside to make
sure that everything goes
according to Hoyle.  We have men
set up a block away from the
warehouse rendezvous.  They got
complete visibility of the
exterior.  So as soon as Joe Cabot
shows up, we'll see it.

FREDDY
What's your visibility of the
interior?

HOLDAWAY
We can't see shit on the inside.
And we can't risk gettin any
closer for fear they'll spot us.

FREDDY
This is bullshit, Jim.  I get all
the fuckin danger of having you
guys in my back pocket but none of
the safety.

HOLDAWAY
What's the matter, Newendyke?  Job
too tough for ya?  No one lied to
you.  You always knew we'd hang
back until Joe Cabot showed up.

FREDDY
Oh this is great.  You ain't
giving me no fuckin protection
whatsoever.  But you are giving me
an attitude.

HOLDAWAY
Since when does an undercover cop
have protection?  Freddy, you came
into this thing with your eyes
wide open, so don't start screamin
blind man now.  I understand
you're nervous.  I wish the
warehouse had more visible
windows, but it doesn't.  We have
to make do with the cards we're
dealt.

FREDDY
I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it.
I'm just remarking on how shitty
the situation is!

HOLDAWAY
I don't mean to be harsh with ya,
but I've found tough love works
best in these situations.  We have
to get Joe Cabot in the company of
the thieves and in the same
vicinity as the loot.
We don't care about these other
bastards.  We're willing to offer
them good deals to testify against
Cabot.

FREDDY
Isn't this risk unorthodox?

HOLDAWAY
What?

FREDDY
Letting them go ahead with the
robbery?

HOLDAWAY
The whole idea behind this
operation is to catch Joe Cabot
red-handed.  We bust these hired
hands, we ain't accomplished shit.
Letting them go through with the
heist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs
are very clean.  We got people
surrounding the perimeter.  We got
a guy and a gal on the inside
posing as a couple shopping for
rings.  We could replace the
employees with cops, but we'd run
the risk of tipping 'em off.

FREDDY
That's out.  They know the faces
of who works what shift.

HOLDAWAY
These guys are professionals.
We're professionals.  It's a risk,
but I think it's a calculated
risk.


45     EXT. KARINA'S FINE JEWELRY - DAY

We see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.

CUSTOMERS coming and going.  STORE CLERKS waiting on
customers through the windows.

While we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr.
White and Freddy talking OFF SCREEN.

MR. WHITE (VO)
Let's go over it.  Where are you?

FREDDY (VO)
I stand outside and guard the
door.  I don't let anybody come in
or go out.

MR. WHITE (VO)
Mr. Brown?

FREDDY (VO)
Mr. Brown stays in the car.  He's
parked across the street till I
give him the signal, then he pulls
up in front of the store.

MR. WHITE (VO)
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?

FREDDY (VO)
Crowd control.  They handle
customers and employees in the
display area.


46     INT. MR. WHITE'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY

Mr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street
from the jewelry store, staking it out.

MR. WHITE
Myself and Mr. Pink?

FREDDY
You two take the manager in the
back and make him give you the
diamonds.  We're there for those
stones, period.  Since no display
cases are being fucked with, no
alarms should go off.  We're out
of there in two minutes, not one
second longer.  What if the
manager won't give up the
diamonds?

MR. WHITE
When you're dealing with a store
like this, they're insured up the
ass.  They're not supposed to give
you and resistance
whatsoever.  If you get a customer
or an employee who thinks he's
Charles Bronson, take the butt of
your gun and smash their nose in.
Drops 'em right to the floor.
Everyone jumps, he falls down,
screaming, blood squirts out his
nose.  Freaks everybody out.
Nobody says fuckin shit after
that.  You might get some bitch
talk shit to ya.  But give her a
look, like you're gonna smash her
in the face next.  Watch her shut
the fuck up.  Now if it's a
manager, that's a different story.
The managers know better than to
fuck around.  So if one's givin
you static, he probably thinks
he's a real cowboy.  So what you
gotta do is break that son-of-a-
bitch in two.  If you wanna know
something and he won't tell you,
cut off one of his fingers.  The
little one.  Then you tell 'im his
thumb's next.  After that he'll
tell ya if he wears ladies
underwear.  I'm hungry, let's get
a taco.

CUT TO:


47     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

It's the moment of the robbery.  The alley is empty.

In the distance we hear all hell breaking loose.  Guns
FIRING, people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING,
glass BREAKING...

A car whips around the corner, into the alley.

The doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out.

Freddy opens the driver's side door.  A bloody SCREAMING
Mr. Brown FALLS out.

MR. BROWN
(screaming)
My eyes!  My eyes!  I'm blind, I'm
fucking blind!

FREDDY
You're not blind, there's just
blood in your eyes.

Mr. White loads his two .45 automatics.  He RUNS to the
end of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT.

FIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the
patrol car.

Freddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr.
White's ambush in shock.

Mr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes.

MR. BROWN
Mr. Orange?  You're Mr. Orange,
aren't you?

By the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown
is dead.

Mr. White RUNS up to Freddy.

MR. WHITE
Is he dead?

Freddy doesn't answer, he can't.

MR. WHITE
Did he did or not?

Freddy, scared.

FREDDY
I'm sorry.

MR. WHITE
What?  Snap out of it!

Mr. White GRABS Freddy by the coat and YANKS him along as
he RUNS.

They EXIT the alley and FLEE down a street.

A car with a FEMALE DRIVER comes up on the two men.

Mr. White JUMPS in her path, stopping the car.  He points
his jun at her.

MR. WHITE
Get us outta here!

Mr. White climbs into the backseat.

Freddy starts to climb in.

The Female driver comes up with a gun from under her seat.

MR. WHITE
The bitch's got a gun!

She SHOOTS Freddy in the stomach.

On instinct Freddy brings up his gun and SHOOTS her in the
face.


C.U. ON FREDDY

as he FALLS to the ground he realizes what's happened
to him and what he's done.  SLOW MOTION.

Mr White DRAGS the dead female driver out of the car.  He
SHOVES Freddy in the backseat and DRIVES away.


48     INT. GETAWAY CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Freddy holding his stomach and doubled over in pain is
CRYING.

We replay the scene between Freddy and Mr. White in the
getaway car.  Except this time, we never leave Freddy.

MR. WHITE (OS)
Just hold on buddy boy.

FREDDY
I'm sorry.  I can't believe she
killed me...


CUT FROM FREDDY IN THE BACKSEAT TO:


49     INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Mr. Pink is behind the wheel, Nice Guy Eddie is in the
passenger seat going through the satchel with the
diamonds.  Mr. White is in the backseat.  The car is
SPEEDING back to the garage.

EDDIE
(looking through the
case)
You know, all things considered,
this was pretty successful.

MR. WHITE
I don't believe you just said
that.

EDDIE
No, it was messy as hell, but do
you realize how much you got away
with?  There's over two million
dollars worth of diamonds here.

MR. PINK
I love this guy.

EDDIE
Hey, what's done is done.  We can
all sit around and have a big cry
about it or we can deal with the
situation at hand.

MR. WHITE
The situation as hand isn't that
fuckin satchel.  You and Joe have
a responsibility to your men.

EDDIE
Hey, it's the best I could do.

MR. WHITE
The man is fucking dying.

EDDIE
And I'm telling you, Bonnie'll
take care of him.

MR. WHITE
He needs a doctor, not a fuckin
nurse.

EDDIE
Ask me how many doctors I called.
You wanna embarrass yourself, ask
me how many doctors I called.

MR. WHITE
Obviously not enough.

EDDIE
Fuck you! You gotta little black
book, then whip is out.  If not,
listen how it is.  I called three
doctors and couldn't get through
to shit.  Now, time being a
factor, I called Bonnie.  Sweet
broad, helluva broad, and a
registered nurse.  Told her a
bullshit story, upside:  she said
bring him to her apartment.

MR. WHITE
If he dies I'm holding you
personally responsible.

EDDIE
Fuck you buddy boy!  Okay, you
wanna play that way.  I am
personally leaving myself
vulnerable with this Bonnie
situation.  I don't think she'll
call the cops, but I don't know
for sure.  But me being too nice-
a-fuckin-guy was willin to risk
it.  But no fuckin more.
(he grabs his
portable phone)
I'm callin Bonnie back and tellin
her to forget it.  You take care
of your friend, you know so much
about it.

MR. PINK
Goddamnit, will you guys grow up!

EDDIE
I don't need to grow up, my
friend.  I am a grown up.  I'm
being responsible, I'm taking care
of business.

MR. WHITE
Cut the shit!  I don't think you
called anybody except some cooze
you once fucked, who happens to
wear orthopedic shoes.  And I
don't think that's good enough
care for a gut-shot man.

EDDIE
Yeah, well I don't give a flying
fuck what you think!

MR. PINK
(to Mr. White)
Look, he's not sayin this bitch is
gonna operate on him.  She's gonna
give him better attention than we
can until we can get a doctor.
Nobody's forgotten about doctors.
Joe'll get one in a snap.  This is
something we're doing in the
meantime.  I think both of you are
actin like a couple of assholes.

EDDIE
Yeah, right.  I arrange a nurse, I
leave myself wide open, and I'm an
asshole.


50     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

MEDIUM SHOT on the door.  Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and
Mr. Pink walk through it.  They stop in their tracks.

We see what they see.  Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground,
shot full of holes.  The cop slumped over in his chair, a
bloody mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding
his wound.  Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the
shot.

EDDIE
What the fuck happened here?

Eddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde Toothpick Vic.

MR. WHITE
(to Mr. Orange)
What happened?

MR. ORANGE
(very weakly)
Blonde went crazy.  He slashed the
cop's face, cut off his ear and
was gonna burn him alive.

EDDIE
(yelling)
Who cares what he was gonna do to
this fuckin pig?

Eddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop.  The cop and
the chair tip over.  Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him
once more.

EDDIE
(to Mr. Orange)
You were saying he went crazy?
Something like that?  Worse or
better?

MR. ORANGE
Look, Eddie, he was pullin a burn.
He was gonna kill the cop and me.
And when you guys walked through
the door, he was gonna blow you to
hell and make off with the
diamonds.

MR. WHITE
(to Eddie)
Uhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya?
That sick piece of shit was a
stone cold psycho.

MR. ORANGE
(to Eddie)
You could've asked the cop, if you
didn't just kill him.  He talked
about what he was going to do when
he was slicing him up.

EDDIE
I don't buy it.  It doesn't make
sense.

MR. WHITE
It makes perfect fuckin sense to
me.  Eddie, you didn't see how he
acted during the job, we did.

Mr. Pink walks over to the cop's body.

MR. PINK
He's right about the ear, it's
hacked off.

EDDIE
(to Mr. Orange)
Let me say this out loud, just to
get it straight in my mind.
According to you, Mr. Blonde was
gonna kill you.  Then when we came
back, kill us, grab the diamonds,
and scram.  That's your story?
I'm correct about that, right?

MR. ORANGE
Eddie, you can believe me or not
believe me, but it's the truth.  I
swear on my mother's eternal soul
that's what happened.

The CAMERA mover into a C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie.

There's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange
has said.  Finally:

EDDIE
You're a fuckin liar.  Now why
don't you drop the fuckin fairy
tale and tell me what really
happened?

MR. WHITE (OS)
He told you what really happened.
You just can't deal with it.

MR. ORANGE (OS)
Okay, you're right, I'm lying.
Even though I'm fuckin dyin I'm
not above pullin a fast one.  Get
rid of Blonde, we share his split
- no, scratch that, I shot him
'cause I didn't like his hair
style.  I didn't like his shoes
either.  If it has just been his
hair, I'd've maybe, maybe I said,
let him live.  But hair and
footwear together, he's a goner.

EDDIE
The man you killed was just
released from prison.  He got
caught at a company warehouse full
of hot items.  He could've walked
away.  All he had to do was say my
dad's name.  But instead he shut
his mouth and did his time.  He
did four years for us, and he did
'em like a man.  And we were very
grateful.  So, Mr. Orange, you're
tellin me this very good friend of
mine, who did four years for my
father, who in four years never
made a deal, no matter what they
dangled in front of him, you're
telling me that now, that now this
man is free, and we're making good
on our commitment to him, he's
just gonna decide, right out of
the fuckin blue, to rip us off?

Silence.

EDDIE
Mr. Orange, why don't you tell me
what really happened?

VOICE (OS)
Why?  It'll just be more bullshit.

Eddie steps out of his C.U. and we see Joe Cabot standing
in the warehouse doorway.  He walks into the room.

JOE
(pointing to Mr.
Orange)
This man set us up.

CAMERA does a 360 around the men.

EDDIE
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know
what's happening.

JOE
That's okay, Eddie, I do.

MR. WHITE
(to Joe)
What the fuck are you talking
about?

JOE
(pointing to Mr.
Orange)
That piece of shit.  Workin with
the cops.

MR. WHITE   MR. PINK   EDDIE
What?

JOE
I said this lump of shit is workin
with the LAPD.


MR. ORANGE'S POV

Looking up from the floor at everybody.

Joe looks down at Mr. Orange.

JOE
Aren't you?

MR. ORANGE (OS)
I don't have the slightest fuckin
idea what you're talkin about.

MR. WHITE
(very calmly to Joe)
Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.

JOE
Like hell I am.

MR. WHITE
(very calmly)
Joe, trust me on this, you've made
a mistake.  He's a good kid. I
understand you're hot, you're
super-fuckin pissed.  We're all
real emotional.  But you're
barking up the wrong tree.  I know
this man, and he wouldn't do that.

JOE
You don't know jack shit.  I do.
This rotten bastard tipped off the
cops and got Mr. Brown and Mr.
Blue killed.

MR. PINK
Mr. Blue's dead?

JOE
Dead as Dillinger.

EDDIE
The motherfucker killed Vic.

MR. WHITE
How do you know all this?

JOE
He was the only one I wasn't a
hundred percent on.  I should have
my fucking head examined for goin
forward when I wasn't a hundred
percent.  But he seemed like a
good kid, and I was impatient and
greedy and all the things that
fuck you up.

MR. WHITE
(screaming)
That's your proof?

JOE
You don't need proof when you got
instinct.  I ignored it before,
but not no more.

He WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange.

Mr. White brings his .45 up at Joe.

Eddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of
firearms.

Eddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.

EDDIE
Have you lost your fucking mind?
Put your gun down!

Mr. Pink fades into the B.G., wanting no part of this.

MR. WHITE
Joe, you're making a terrible
mistake I can't let you make.

EDDIE
Stop pointing your fuckin gun at
daddy!

Joe, never taking his eyes off Mr. Orange.

JOE
Don't worry, Eddie.  Me and Larry
have been friends a long time, he
ain't gonna shoot.  We like each
other too much.

MR. WHITE
Joe, if you kill that man, you die
next.  Repeat, if you kill that
man, you die next!

We get many different angles of the Mexican standoff.


MEDIUMS ON EVERYBODY

Mr. Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right.

Joe pointing down on Mr. Orange.  Not taking his eyes off
him.

Mr. White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to
start firing any minute.

Eddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr.
White.

Mr. Pink walking backwards away from the action.

Nobody says nothing.


FOUR SHOT

of guys ready for violence.  Mr. Pink in the B.G.

MR. PINK
C'mon, guys, nobody wants this.
We're supposed to me fuckin
professionals!

Joe raises his head to Mr. White.

JOE
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.

MR. WHITE
Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do
this!

JOE
Larry, I'm askin you to trust me
on this.

MR. WHITE
Don't ask me that.

JOE
I'm not askin, I'm betting.

Joe's eyes go back to Mr. Orange.

EDDIE
Daddy, don't!

Joe FIRES three times, HITTING Mr. Orange with every one.

Mr. White SHOOTS Joe twice in the face.  Joe brings his
hands up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground.

Eddie FIRES at Mr. White, HITTING him three times in the
chest.

Mr. White brings his gun around on Eddie and SHOOTS him.

The two men FALL to their knees, FIRING at each other.

Eddie COLLAPSES, dead.

Joe's dead.

Mr. Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest
heaving.  The only SOUND we hear is his loud breathing.

Mr. White is SHOT full of holes, but still on his knees,
not moving.

Mr. Pink is standing motionless.  Finally he grabs the
satchel of diamonds and RUNS out the door.

We hear outside a CAR START.  Then the SOUND of a BULLHORN
yells out:

POLICE FORCE (OS)
Freeze! Get out of the car and lie
face down on the ground!

MR. PINK (OS)
Don't shoot!

We now hear SIRENS, the SOUNDS of more CARS DRIVING UP,
MEN RUNNING to the warehouse.

While all this noise is going on, Mr. White tries to stand
but FALLS DOWN.  He somehow makes it to where Mr. Orange
lies.

He lifts Mr. Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and
stroking his brow.

MR. WHITE
(with much effort)
Sorry, kid.  Looks like we're
gonna do a little time.

Mr. Orange looks up at him and, with even more of an
effort:

MR. ORANGE
I'm a cop.

Mr. White doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking Orange's
brow.

MR. ORANGE
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

Mr. White lifts his .45 and places the barrel between Mr.
Orange's eyes.

The CAMERA MOVES into an EXTREME C.U. of Mr White.

The SOUNDS of outside STORM inside.  We don't see
anything, but we HEAR a bunch of shotguns COCKING.

POLICE FORCE (OS)
Freeze, motherfucker!  Drop your
fucking gun!

Mr White looks up at them, smiles, PULLS the trigger.

BANG

We hear a BURST of SHOTGUN FIRE.

Mr. White is BLOWN out of frame, leaving it empty.

STAR TREK: NEMESIS

by

John Logan

FADE IN:

INT.  MEDICAL MONTAGE - DAY

Life.  Glorious in its many forms.  The biological pulse
finding its way heroically through the cold manipulation of
science.

CREDITS as we see a beautiful montage of futuristic medical
technology.  Through a microscope we see cells multiplying
and gene strands exponentially increasing with the vibrancy
of exploding flowers.  We see laser splicing and biological
manipulation on the molecular level.

CREDITS continue as we fade to...

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Politics... In a cavernous, shadowy chamber.  Dark figures
lean together and talk seriously.  Their hushed, urgent tones
denote the gravity of their discussion.

We can't make out the words but there is no doubt what they
are talking about.

The three year old HUMAN BOY who stands before them.  The boy
is alone and frightened, lost in the sweeping grandeur of
the massive chamber.

CREDITS continue as we fade to...

EXT.  REMAN HOMEWORLD - NIGHT

Labor...

On a stark, desert planet with monolithic mountains and harsh
crags shooting upward.  The only light in this dark
netherworld comes from the flames that accompany the hellish
mining operations everywhere around us.

The human boy gazes over this desolate vista and then he
looks up for a moment... at the stars.

Then a tall figure leads him firmly into one of the mines.
The boy seems to disappear into this flaming crucible.
CREDITS end as we go to...

EXT.  ROMULUS - SUNSET

The sun is setting on the capital city of the great Romulan
Star Empire, The imperial monoliths and martial towers of
this bustling city glow red as the sun dips below the
horizon.

We slowly move down toward the most imposing building of the
city.  The Romulan Senate chamber.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - SUNSET

SENATOR TAL'AURA watches the proceedings with a studied look
of bored indifference.  She glances to the familiar Romulan
crest that dominates one wall of the chamber: a ferocious
bird-of-prey holding two planets, one in either claw.

And then her eyes carefully cross the chamber to...

PRAETOR HIREN -- the head of the Romulan government --
presiding over the Senate from a throne-like chair.  He is a
capable politician in his 50s.

SENATOR 1
... but if we hesitate we'll lose
this important source of dilithium.
A trade agreement is in the best
interests of the Empire.

SENATOR 2
Praetor, I recommend we dispatch a
diplomatic mission to Celes II to
open negotiations.

Senator Tal'Aura grunts slightly at the word "negotiations."
Praetor Hiren glances to her.

PRAETOR
Senator Tal'Aura, you disagree with
the motion.

TAL'AURA
No, sir.  I would say "negotiation"
is to be advised.  I support all
"diplomatic" overtures.  But if you
will excuse me, Praetor, I have an
appointment with the Tholian
ambassador.

The Praetor nods.  Tal'Aura stands and leaves the chamber...
but she had left something behind on her desk.  A small,
silver box with unusual etchings on the surface.

The discussion continues as we focus on the silver box...

PRAETOR
Then I will call for a vote on the
motion to open trade negotiations
with Celes II...

The Senator at the desk next to Tal'Aura's glances over.  The
silver box is moving.

The Senator watches, amazed, as the box begins to slowly fold
open.  Then "legs" appear.  The box unfolds like a spider,
standing on its legs.  Then it is still for a moment.  The
Senator looks at it, puzzled.

Suddenly -- a bright beam of green light shoots up from the
spider -- the Senators are stunned -- the beam shoots to the
high domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades around
the interior of the room, enveloping everything in a glowing
shroud of green energy.  In a way, it is bizarrely beautiful.

And then just as suddenly the light disappears.

A moment of silence.  The Praetor and Senators are baffled.

PRAETOR
Would someone please tell me what
that was?
(he turns to a guard)
Alert security --

A plant behind the Praetor begins to shrivel...

PRAETOR
-- and have them run a --

The Praetor stops suddenly -- as the flesh begins to melt
from his face.

Every bit of organic matter in the chamber decays.  Flesh
melts from bones while the Senators scream in agony.  Every
living thing in the chamber is dead within ten seconds.

A stunning moment of silence as we take in the carnage.  Then
a transporter effect ripples around the spider-weapon.  It
disappears.

And the Romulan Senate is no more.  We fade to...

EXT.  EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - DAY

JEAN LUC PICARD, the most beloved and respected Captain in
Starfleet.

His face is resolute and set.  Even stern.  His white dress
uniform is buttoned tightly to the neck.

He looks at us evenly and then utters the word that has been
the watch cry for his entire life as a Starfleet officer.

PICARD
Duty...

He lets the word resonate and then continues.

PICARD
A starship captain's life is filled
with solemn duty.  I have commanded
men in battle.  I have negotiated
peace treaties between implacable
enemies.  I have represented the
Federation in first contact with
twenty-seven alien species.  But
none of this compares to my solemn
duty as... Best man.

Uproarious laughter.  We pull back to reveal the wedding
reception of WILL RIKER and DEANNA TROI.

The Enterprise CREW is gathered with invited GUESTS, some
from other "Star Trek" series.  Riker and Deanna sit at the
center of a long table.

PICARD
Now, I know that on an occasion
such as this: it is expected that I
be gracious and fulsome with praise
on the wonders of this blessed
union... But have you two
considered what you're doing to?
This is all a damned
inconvenience...
(laughter from the crowd)
While you're happily settling in on
the Titan, I'll have to train a new
first officer; no doubt a stern
martinet who'll quote the rule book
at me and never... ever... allow me
to go on away missions.
(laughter)
... Then there's the matter of my
new counselor.  Undoubtedly some
soft-spoken, willowy thing who'll
be probing into my darkest psyche
as she nods her head and coos
sympathetically.  Isn't that right,
Deanna?

Deanna nods her head and coos sympathetically.  Hearty,
wonderful LAUGHTER!

PICARD
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along
with the rest of you.  As most of
you know, the doctor will also soon
be leaving the Enterprise, to
assume command of Starfleet
Medical.  Again, I'm forced to ask,
Beverly, have you considered what
you're doing to little ole' me?!
I'll probably get some old battle-
axe of a doctor who'll tell me to
eat my vegetables and put me on
report if I don't show up for my
physical on time!

BEVERLY
It'll serve you right.

Laughter, laughter, laughter!  He looks to Riker and Deanna:

PICARD
Really, it's not too late to
reconsider.  No?  Very well then...

He smiles and raises his glass, looks at them deeply.

PICARD
Will Riker, you have been my
trusted right arm for fourteen
years; you have helped keep my
course true and steady.  Deanna
Troi, you have been my conscience
and best guide, the touchstone to
the better parts of myself.  You
are my family.  And in proper
maritime tradition I wish you full
sails and a clear horizon... My
friends, make it so.

They drink.

EXT.  EARTH, ALASKA - PAVILION - LATER

The party guests mingle as a band plays.  We are at a
beautiful open-air pavilion high in the Denali Mountains.
The soaring ranges of Riker's native Alaska can be seen
everywhere around us.

DR. BEVERLY CRUSHER goes to Picard.

BEVERLY
(playfully)
Sort of like losing a son and
gaining an empath, isn't it?

PICARD
Please, Beverly, this is hard
enough.

BEVERLY
If you start tearing up I promise
to beam you out.  Level one medical
emergency.  There's no crying in
Starfleet.

They head off toward Riker and Deanna.

Meanwhile, GEORDI LA FORGE sits with his girlfriend.

LEAH
I've never seen your Captain so
nostalgic.  Maybe he's getting soft
in his old age.

GEORDI
(laughs)
Not likely.  After we installed the
new Series Four replicators, he
tried to order his usual tea and
there was a glitch.  Had us remove
the whole bunch of them and put the
old ones back in.

LEAH
There!  Nostalgic about old
replicators.

GEORDI
He just likes things the way he
likes them...
(he looks at her, smiles)
Of course, so do I.

He kisses her gently as WORF comes to them.  Poor Worf is
still suffering a bit from the bachelor party.  He plops down
beside them, belches.

WORF
Romulan ale should be illegal.

GEORDI
It is, old chum.

WORF
Then it should be more illegal.

He groans and rests his head on the table, acts like he's
going to heave.  Meanwhile, Riker and Deanna are talking to
Picard and Beverly.

DEANNA
Really, Captain, it was a lovely
toast.

PICARD
The least I could do for you,
Deanna.  Besides, you know me...
I'm a talking head.

DEANNA
And you needn't worry.  I'll brief
your new counselor on everything
she needs to know.

PICARD
The hell you will.  You know too
much about me as it is... Now you
promised there are no speeches
during the ceremony on Betazed.

RIKER
No, no speeches.  No clothes
either.
(winks, mischievously)

Picard looks at him.  Deanna laughs.

Then the band stops playing.  All turn.

DATA stands with the band.

DATA
Ladies and Gentlemen and invited
Tran gendered species... In my
study of Terran and Betazoid
conjugal rites I have discovered it
is traditional to present the
"happy couple" with a gift.  Given
Commander Riker's affection for
archaic musical forms I have
elected to present the following as
my gift in honor of their
conjugation.

Riker shoots an amused glance to Deanna.  Conjugation?

Data turns to the band leader.

DATA
If you please, Mister Band Leader,
a-one and a-two and...

The band launches into a jaunty, swing version of the Irving
Berlin standard "Blue Skies."

DATA
(sings)
"Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing
but blue skies do I see.  Blue
birds, singing a song, Nothing but
blue birds all day long.  Never saw
the sun shining so bright, Never
saw things going so right..."

The crowd is appreciative.  Loves the song.  Except Worf, he
momentarily raises his head from the table.

WORF
(groans)
Ugghhh... Irving Berlin.

His heads thumps down again, is about ready to BARF!
Meanwhile, Riker is anxious as a kid to join the band:

DEANNA
(smiles)
All right, go ahead.

Riker eagerly joins the band.  Grabs the trombone and starts
jamming with the orchestra.  The song really swings.

PICARD
(to Deanna)
May I have this dance?

DEANNA
With pleasure, Captain.

Meanwhile, Geordi leads Leah to the dance floor as well.
Beverly goes to Worf.

BEVERLY
Commander Worf... Do Klingons
swing?

WORF
I am not a swinger.  I am unwell.

BEVERLY
Don't worry, I'm a doctor.

She pulls him to the dance floor as:

BEVERLY
I'm so glad you made it back to the
Enterprise before I left.

WORF
I was not suited for the life of
a... diplomat.

BEVERLY
(wry)
Who'd have guessed?

They dance.  Picard and Deanna sweep past them.

And we pull up and away as Data continues to sing and the
crew dances.  It is a joyous celebration of these people.

This family.  A family we love.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

The Enterprise streaks through space.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Data sits in the empty Crew Lounge.

As always, the android's placid, neutral expression still
somehow manages to convey his wonder, curiosity and
idiosyncratic zest for life.

Picard arrives with a very old bottle of wine.

PICARD
I've been saving this.  Chateau
Picard 2267.  Batten down the
hatches...

He carefully uncorks the treasured bottle as:

PICARD
They say a vintner's history is in
every glass.  The soil he came
from.  His past as well as his
hopes for the future.

He pours two glasses of the wine, then raises his glass, a
toast.

PICARD
So... To happy endings.

DATA
To happy endings.

Picard carefully takes a tiny sip, savors the flavor, finally
swallows.  Enjoys it.  Ahhh.

Data mimics Picard.  Taking a tiny sip, savoring the flavor
and finally swallowing.  Ahhh.

DATA
Sir.  I noticed an interesting
confluence of emotion at the
wedding.  I am familiar with the
human concept of tears through
laughter and its inverse, laughter
through tears, but I could not help
wondering about the human capacity
for expressing both pleasure and
sadness simultaneously.

PICARD
I understand why it would seem
confusing.  Certain human rituals --
like weddings, birthdays or
funerals evoke strong and very
complex emotions.  These rites
carry great weight with us because
they denote the passage of time.

DATA
And you were particularly aware of
this feeling because Commander
Riker will be leaving to assume
command of the Titan?

PICARD
Will and Deanna joining the Titan.
Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet
Medical...

DATA
And this makes you "sad"?

PICARD
Well.  I suppose it does a bit.
I'm very happy for them, of course,
but I'm going to miss them.  The
ship will seem... incomplete
without them.

DATA
That is because you have a
familiarity with them.  You can
predict specific reactions and
behavior and are comfortable in
that knowledge.

PICARD
Yes.  And, frankly, I envy them as
well.  They've made important
choices; they're going to have
great challenges ahead of them.
New worlds to conquer...

He takes another sip of wine.  A beat.

PICARD
Seeing Will and Deanna today made
me think about some of the choices
I've made in my own life.  Devoting
myself to Starfleet... Not marrying
or having children... All the
choices that led me here.

A beat.  Data thinks about it.

DATA
The choices I made have led me here
as well.  This is the only home I
have ever known.  I cannot foresee
a reason for leaving.

PICARD
You never know what's over the
horizon, Data.  Before too long
you'll be offered a command of your
own.  Data looks at him; he has
never really considered this.

DATA
If I were... I believe my memory
engrams would sense the absence of
your specific reactions and
behavior.  I would "miss you."

PICARD
(smiles)
Now, you make a toast.

DATA
To new worlds...

PICARD
New worlds.  Yes Data, brave new
worlds...

They drink.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Flickering braziers dimly illuminate the cold, martial
splendor of a Senate corridor.

COMMANDER DONATRA and COMMANDER SURAN stride through the
corridor.

Suran is an elder Romulan officer, respected and tenacious.
Donatra -- a key figure in this story so pay close attention
to her -- is a mature, beautiful woman... not without a dry
sense of humor.

SURAN
The fleet commanders are nervous.
They've agreed to remain at their
given coordinates and await his
orders.  But they're anxious to
know what's going on here.

DONATRA
I don't blame them.  We can't keep
them in the dark forever.

A voice, from the shadows:

VICEROY (V.O.)
But in darkness, there is strength.

Donatra and Suran stop.

And the VICEROY steps from the shadows...

He is a terrifying sight  A powerful, monstrous alien
creature; a tall, ashen-skinned ectomorph who bears a
disturbing resemblance to the original Nosferatu.  He is
vampiric and lethal.  He is a Reman.

VICEROY
Don't you agree?

He leads them along the corridor.

INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

We observe the Romulan crest, an imposing bird-of-prey
clutching a planet in either claw, not unlike the KAOS emblem
from "Get Smart," that dominates a wall.  As we hear:

SHINZON (V.O.)
Consider it  The great symbol of
the Empire... But the bird-of-prey
holds planets.  Romulus, Remus.
Their destinies conjoined...

And then we see him... SHINZON!

He is a dynamic young human in his twenties.  Very handsome
with pale, almost white skin and shining, golden hair.  He
wears a striking Reman military uniform.

He stands in the center of the eerily deserted chamber.  The
entire floor is a large star chart.

SHINZON
Yet for generations one of those
planets has been without a voice.
We will be silent no longer.

Senator Tal'Aura (the female Senator who planted the weapon
in the Senate chamber earlier) and two other ROMULAN
COMMANDERS sit.

Cadres of Shinzon's fearsome REMAN WARRIORS stand around the
chamber.  They are his sinister children of the night.  Even
more chilling now in the flickering torch light.  It's like
something out of Tim Burton.

Donatra and Suran enter the chamber with Shinzon's Viceroy.

SHINZON
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's
the disposition of the fleet?

SURAN
They're holding position.

SHINZON
And?

SURAN
(bows his head)
They will obey, Praetor.

SHINZON
It's imperative we retain their
allegiance or our great mission
will be strangled before it can
truly draw breath.

DONATRA
They support your intentions, sir.
But they require evidence of
your... sincerity.

Shinzon looks at her.  A quick beat.  Shinzon decides to
respond with benevolence.  He smiles.

SHINZON
And they'll have it.
(he begins to pace over
the star chart)
Tell the fleet that the days of
negotiation and diplomacy are over.
The Almighty Federation will fall
before us.  As I promised you.

He stands on the area of the map that denotes the Neutral
Zone between the Romulan Empire and the Federation.

SHINZON
The time we have dreamed of is at
hand.  The time... of conquest.
(sinister laugh)

He carefully steps into the area of the map marked with the
Federation symbol.  He looks down at the star chart.

SHINZON
Cut off the dragon's head and it
cannot strike back.

A beat.  Donatra watches him carefully.  Something in his
quiet words disturbs her.

SURAN
How many Warbirds will you need?

SHINZON
None.

They look at him, stunned.

SURAN
Praetor.  You have the whole fleet
at your disposal.  They supported
the coup, they'll follow you.

SHINZON
The Scimitar will serve my needs.

SURAN
But surely --

SHINZON
I came this far alone...
(he looks at his Reman
warriors)
We came this far alone.  We require
no assistance from the fleet.  Now
leave me to my thoughts.

The Commanders and Senator Tal'Aura rise and leave.  Shinzon
looks to his Viceroy.

SHINZON
Are we prepared?

VICEROY
Yes, Praetor.

A beat.

SHINZON
So many years for this moment.
(he looks up at his
Viceroy, smiles)
Bring him to me.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - DAY

The bridge crew are at their stations.  Picard is not on the
bridge.

WORF
(grumbles)
I won't do it.

DEANNA
It's tradition,Worf.  You of all
people should appreciate that!
(whispers)
Besides, I've already seen it.

WORF
A warrior does not appear without
his clothing.  It leaves him...
vulnerable.

RIKER
I don't think we're going to see
much combat on Betazed.

DEANNA
Don't be too sure.  Mother will be
there.

Worf groans.  Picard emerges from his Ready Room as:

WORF
I won't do it.

PICARD
Won't do what, Mister Worf?

WORF
Captain.  I think it is
inappropriate for a Starfleet
officer to appear...
(hates the word)
... naked.

PICARD
Come now, a big, strapping fellow
like you?  What are you afraid of?

Deanna laughs.  Then a readout on Worf's console attracts his
attention:

WORF
I'm picking up an unusual
electromagnetic signature from the
Kolarin system.

PICARD
What sort of signature?

Worf looks up.  Glances at Data.

WORF
Positronic.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - LATER

Geordi is at the Engineering station with Picard, Riker and
Data.

GEORDI
It's very faint but I've isolated
it to the third planet in the
Kolarin system.

PICARD
What do we know about the planet?

GEORDI
Uncharted.  We'll have to get
closer for a more detailed scan.

PICARD
(to Data)
Theories?

DATA
Since positronic signatures have
only been known to emanate from
androids such as myself, it is
logical to theorize that there is
an android such as myself on
Kolarus III.

GEORDI
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?

DATA
I thought only me, myself and Lore.

RIKER
(looking at star chart)
Diverting to the Kolarin system
takes us awfully close to the
Romulan Neutral Zone.

PICARD
(looking at star chart)
Still well on our side...

Picard glances at Data, recognizes the android's deep desire
to explore this possible connection to others like himself.

PICARD
I think it's worth a look.  Don't
worry, Number One, we'll get you to
Betazed with time to spare.

RIKER
Thank you, sir...

PICARD
(to all, especially Worf)
Where we will all honor the
Betazoid traditions.  No cold feet,
or any other parts of our anatomy.
Now, if you'll excuse me.  I'll be
in the gym.

He goes.

RIKER
(to Helm Officer)
Mister Branson, set course for the
Kolarin system.  Warp Five --
(Deanna shoots him a
glance)
-- Warp Seven.

HELM OFFICER (MISTER BRANSON)
Plotted and laid in, sir.

RIKER
Engage.

DEANNA
You better believe you're engaged!

Meanwhile, Geordi and Data remain at the Engineering Station,
studying the displays.

GEORDI
What do you think, Data, a long-
lost relative?

Data doesn't respond, but the curiosity on his face is
apparent.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER KOLARUS III - SPACE

The Enterprise is in orbit around the uncharted planet.  In
the distance we can see the distorting violence of an ion
storm.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

Kolarus III is on the viewscreen, the ion storm raging beyond
it.

GEORDI
I read six distinct positronic
signatures, spread out over a few
kilometers on the surface.

PICARD
What do we know about the
population?

DATA
Isolated pockets of humanoids.  It
appears to be a pre-warp
civilization at an early stage of
industrial development.

GEORDI
Captain, I don't recommend
transporting, that ion storm
doesn't look very neighborly.  It
could head this way without much
warning.

PICARD
Understood.  Data, Worf, you're
with me.

Picard, Data and Worf start heading toward the turbolift.

RIKER
(stands, protesting)
Captain, I hope I don't have to
remind you --

PICARD
I appreciate your concern, Number
One, but I've been itching to try
out the Argo.

RIKER
Sir --

PICARD
Captain's prerogative, Will.
There's no foreseeable danger...
and your wife would never forgive
me if anything happened to you.

He steps into the turbolift with the Data and Worf.

PICARD
You have the bridge, Mister Troi!

The turbolift doors slide shut.

The bridge crew heartily enjoys Riker's momentary demotion to
house husband.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER KOLARUS III - DAY

The shuttlebay doors slide open and the transport vehicle
Argo emerges.

The Argo is larger than a regular shuttle with a particularly
large cargo area at the back.

EXT.  KOLARUS III - DAY

The Argo lands on the planet.  It is primarily a desert
environment with some canyons and mountains.  Like Death
Valley, blazing heat waves shimmer in the distance.  The
shuttle sits silently for a moment.  We wonder at the delay,
then...

The rear cargo doors slide open and Picard, Data and Worf
roar out on a 24th Century equivalent of a military jeep!

Picard drives, Data beside him.  Worf stands in the back at a
mounted phaser canon.  It is a muscular, exciting vehicle; a
Starfleet version of the jeep from old television series "The
Rat Patrol."

Picard screeches to a stop.  Data and Worf lurch.  A cloud of
dust momentarily obscures them.  Data quickly monitors the
positronic signatures with a tricorder:

DATA
The closest signature is two
kilometers to the west... that
direction, sir.

PICARD
Thank you, Data.
(he smiles)
Let's see what she can do.

He roars off in a cloud of dust!

Picard clearly enjoys driving.  He roars over the desert
terrain at breakneck speed, having a hell of a good time.
His comrades don't exactly appreciate his free-spirited
driving panache.

Worf clings on to the mounted phaser canon for dear life.
Data steadies himself by grasping onto the rollbar

DATA
I will always be baffled by the
human predilection for piloting
vehicles at unsafe velocities.

Picard smiles and drives a little faster.

DATA
(monitoring with
tricorder)
Over that rise, sir... half a
kilometer.

They continue on.  Before long they can see something on the
level desert floor before them.  They approach and stop to
discover...

An android arm.  The fingers patiently drumming the ground.

DATA
It appears to be...
(he scans with his
tricorder)
... an arm.

WORF
(suspicious)
Why is it moving?

DATA
Like me, it has been designed with
modular power sources.

PICARD
Mister Worf, if you please.

Worf climbs from the jeep and carefully approaches the arm.
Gingerly picks it up.  The arm responds to being picked up,
the hand starts feeling around in the air like something from
a horror movie.  Worf shudders.

He returns to the jeep.  Quickly sets the arm down in the
rear cargo area.

DATA
The next signature is one kilometer
to the south.

Picard starts the jeep in motion.

Time passes as they continue on... coming across another
arm... a leg... a torso... another leg... various
disassembled components of a Data-like android!

EXT.  JEEP - KOLARUS III - CANYON - DAY

Worf stands uneasily amidst the moving body parts.  There is
only one component missing: the head.  Picard steers the jeep
into a canyon.  Stops.  Data scans with his tricorder,
pointing it up into the gently sloping hills that form the
sides of the canyon.

DATA
The final signature is
approximately 300 meters up that
incline.

PICARD
Mister Worf, accompany Data please.

WORF
(uneasy)
To find the head, sir?

PICARD
(amused)
If you don't mind.

Worf and Data climb up into the hills in pursuit of the final
piece as Picard opens the jeep's hood and checks the engine.

EXT.  KOLARUS III - HILLS - DAY

Worf and Data climb as Data scans and indicates the
direction:

DATA
Ten meters...

Worf pulls his phaser, ready.

DATA
I think it unlikely you will need
your phaser to recover the cranial
unit.  Of course, it could bite
you.

Then they see it.

Data's head.  Or the spitting image anyway.  Lying inert in
the dust before them.

WORF
It's you.

DATA
The resemblance is... striking.

Then the head's eyes suddenly pop open.  It looks up at them
with a sort of blank, childlike wonder.

HEAD
Why am I looking at me?

DATA
You are not looking at yourself.
You are looking at me.

HEAD
(looking at Worf)
You do not look like me.

WORF
No.

DATA
(to head)
I would like to pick you up now.
May I do that?

HEAD
(to Worf)
You have a pretty shirt.

WORF
Thank you.

Data gently picks up the head.  Looks at it.  The two
identical faces gaze at each other.

DATA
Fascinating...

Then BLAM! -- a boulder near them explodes.  Worf and Data
spin to see...

A nomadic tribe of desert ALIENS swarming toward them firing
primitive plasma weapons --

Data and Worf race back down the canyon, toward the jeep --
some open-field running and a bit of phaser action -- Worf
firing to distract and slow the aliens, not kill them --
through all of this the head is chattering away blandly:

HEAD
I have two arms and ten fingers.
Do you know where my arms are?  I
cannot see where we are going.
Where are we going?
(Etc... like Threepio in
"Empire" when he's
strapped to Chewbacca's
back.)

The action continues.  Then Data finds himself almost
surrounded --

DATA
Commander!

Worf turns -- Data throws the head to Worf like a football, a
perfect spiral -- the head is still chattering away -- Worf
catches it --

WORF
STOP TALKING!

The head abruptly stops talking.

Data, hands free now, quickly incapacitates the aliens around
him with a dazzling demonstration of his superior strength
and agility.

Meanwhile, Worf tucks the head under his arm and sprints like
a master running back -- evading aliens and occasionally
firing his phaser --

They are closer to the jeep now -- but they are in trouble --
the swarm of aliens almost overtaking them -- !

When a thundering BLAST sends up a shower of debris, stopping
the aliens -- Picard is standing in the rear of the jeep,
firing the phaser canon.

Data and Worf climb into the jeep as Picard leaps into the
front seat and roars off --

INT.  EXT.  JEEP - KOLARUS III - FOLLOWING

Worf, standing at the phaser canon, quickly hands the head to
Data in the front seat:

WORF
If you wouldn't mind.

DATA
Thank you.

The head looks up at Picard.

HEAD
You have a shiny head.

Picard glances at the head.

DATA
He is very observant.

PICARD
I can see that.

WORF
Captain!

Picard turns to see that they are being pursued!  The aliens
are racing after them in crude desert-terrain vehicles --

PICARD
(to Data)
Shall we try some "unsafe
velocities?"

He floors it -- racing across the desert landscape.

Worf fires the mounted phaser canon -- blasting away at the
aliens, not killing them, just stopping them -- a few
dramatic crashes as the alien vehicles overturn --

Meanwhile:

HEAD
(to Picard)
You have a red shirt.

DATA
(to head)
This is not an appropriate time for
a conversation.

HEAD
Why?

DATA
Because the captain has to
concentrate on piloting the
vehicle.

HEAD
Why?

PICARD
Data!

DATA
Sorry, sir.

They continue to speed over the landscape -- bouncing and
flying over natural rises in the terrain -- trying to evade
their pursuers --

Picard puts the pedal to the metal and races through the
alien vehicles -- weaving in and out, avoiding their fire --
Worf blasts away with the phaser cannon -- an exhilarating
adventure --

Finally they are within sight of the Argo -- but they see it
is surrounded by more of the aliens!

PICARD
Mister Data.  Let's make like the
wind.

Data punches some buttons on a dashboard console -- and the
Argo LIFTS OFF by remote control --

Data uses the console to swing the Argo around and lower the
rear cargo doors -- it hovers over the surface --

Picard floors the jeep -- using a natural rise in the terrain
as a ramp -- the jeep FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -- over the
aliens -- and into the cargo bay --

INT.  ARGO - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING

Picard slams on the brakes -- the jeep screeches to a stop as
the doors shut and the Argo shoots into the air.

Picard climbs from the jeep.  He nonchalantly rubs a bit of
dirt from the hood and then disappears into the main cabin.

Data and Worf remain in the jeep for a beat, stunned.

WORF
(smiles)
He must have Klingon blood.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY

Beverly gazes at the android head.  It gazes back at her.

BEVERLY
I think you have nicer eyes.

We pull back to reveal she is speaking to Data.  Data stands
with Picard, Riker and Geordi.

DATA
Our eyes are identical, Doctor.

The android is in a framework rig that holds the various body
parts in place.  The parts are not yet assembled

RIKER
Geordi?

GEORDI
(at work analyzing the
torso section)
Well, he seems to have the same
internal mechanics as Data but not
as much positronic development.
The neural pathways aren't nearly
as sophisticated.  I'd say he's a
prototype.  Something Dr. Soong
created before Data.

DATA
(to head)
Do you have a name, sir?

HEAD
I am the B-9.

PICARD
Be-nign.  Dr. Soong's penchant for
whimsical names seems to have no
end.

HEAD
(to Riker)
You have a fuzzy face.

PICARD
(trying to ignore the
head)
Keep me informed, Number One, and,
please, put him back together.

He goes.  Geordi and Data begin to reassemble the B-9 piece
by piece like the Tin Man as:

DATA
Can you tell me how you came to be
on the planet where we found you?

B-9
(blandly)
I was taken from my homeworld by
people called the "PakJeds." They
are fat.  They traded me to a ship
belonging to the "Bolians." The
"Bolians" are blue.  They put me in
a seat and asked me questions.
Then they were attacked by another
ship...

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering blandly away.  He is more
fully assembled   By this time Beverly is thoroughly bored.

B-9
Then people called the
Delviciansans picked me up.  They
have long teeth.  They asked if I
do anything to help them.  I told
them I could do whatever they
wanted.  They asked me to clean out
the matrix manifolds.  I told them
I did not know what an Matrix
manifold looks like.

BEVERLY
Excuse me.  I have some diagnostics
to run on some medical scanner
things.

She quickly exits.

B-9
And after they showed me the
"engine manifolds." Then they
showed me something called a
"plasma mop"

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering away.  He is almost completely
assembled by now.  Riker is bored out of his mind.

B-9
... then the "Cardassians" put me
into something called a "garbage
chute" and I went out into space
again --

WORF (V.O.) (ON COMM)
Worf to Commander Riker.  I have
the tactical manifests ready, sir.

RIKER
(quickly tapping his comm
badge)
Worf!  Wonderful!  I'll be right
there!...
(he stands)
Duty calls, gentlemen.  Carry on.

He escapes.

B-9
Fuzzy face is gone.

DATA
Yes, please continue.

B-9
I was in space for a long time.
Then a ship belonging to the
"Talosians" picked me up.  They
asked me where I came from.  I told
them people called the "Pakleds"
took me from my homeworld.  They
are fat...

Geordi groans.

Time passes...

And still the B-9 is yammering away.  By this time Geordi is
slumped in a chair and only Data is listening.  The B-9 is
fully assembled.

B-9
Then I opened my eyes and saw you.

A beat.  The B-9 is finally done with his tale...

DATA
Do you know who I am?

B-9
You are me.

DATA
No.  My name is Data... I am your
brother.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Riker and Deanna are having dinner with Worf.

DEANNA
(to Worf)
... and after the ceremony on
Betazed, three entire weeks for our
honeymoon.

RIKER
We're going sailing on the Opal
Sea.  We've booked an old-fashioned
solar catamaran.  Just us and the
sun and the waves.

WORF
It seems a very... soft honeymoon.

DEANNA
(amused)
It's meant to be relaxing.

WORF
A Klingon honeymoon begins with the
Kholamar desert march where the
couple bonds in endurance trials.
If they survive the challenge they
move on to the Fire Caves of
Fek'lhr to face the demons of
Gre'thor.

RIKER
Well, that sounds relaxing too.

WORF
It is... invigorating.

They see Data enter the lounge, carefully leading the B-9.

RIKER
So they've got him up and running.

WORF
He's a very unusual android

RIKER
(smiles)
Runs in the family.

They watch as Data leads the B-9 to a table.  Data instructs
him to sit.  The B-9 sits and stares forward placidly.  Data
shows him how use a napkin.

A note of concern passes over Deanna's face as she watches
Data and the B-9.

There is something strangely poignant in the twin androids.
One a bundle of curiosity and intelligence; the other
somewhat like a slow, simple child.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT

Picard is at his replicator unit.

PICARD
Earl Grey, hot.

A cup of tea appears.  He takes it as the door chime sounds.

PICARD
Come.
(Deanna enters)
Counselor.

DEANNA
Do you have a moment, sir?

PICARD
Of course, sit down.

He sits at his desk  She sits across from him.

DEANNA
It's about Data  I've watched him
with the B-9 and I'm troubled.
Data's desire for a "family" is
very strong.  I'm afraid he may be
investing too much in the B-9.

PICARD
You're speaking of emotional
investment?

DEANNA
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir.
And Data, in his own way, has
assumed the position of a parent or
guardian.  I'm afraid he has
expectations based on his own
experiences.  He'll be disappointed
when the B-9 cannot meet those
expectations.

PICARD
As much as we care for him,
Deanna... we have to remember that
Data isn't capable of
disappointment.

DEANNA
I don't believe that, sir.  We've
shared many disappointing journeys.

A quiet beat.

PICARD
I'm going to miss you.

DEANNA
And I you.

They are interrupted by a comm signal:

RIKER (V.O.) (ON COMM)
Captain, you have an Alpha Priority
communication from Starfleet
Command.

PICARD
Acknowledged...
(Deanna stands)
... I'll talk to Data

DEANNA
Thank you, sir.

She goes.  Picard activates his desktop viewscreen.

ADMIRAL KATHRYN JANEWAY appears on Picard's monitor.  Janeway
is the former captain of Voyager.  Her new rank fits her
well, she has lost none of her dry humor and down-to-earth
charm which made her a household name and beloved cult
figure.

PICARD
Admiral Janeway.  Good to see you.

JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
Jean Luc... How'd you like a trip
to Romulus?  All expenses paid?

PICARD
(smiles)
With or without the rest of the
fleet?

JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
A diplomatic mission.  We've been
invited, believe it or not.  Seems
there's been some kind of internal
political shakeup.  The new
Praetor, someone called Shinzon,
has requested a Federation envoy.

PICARD
New Praetor?

JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
There's more... as always.  He's
Reman.
(Picard is surprised)
Believe me, we don't understand it
either.  You're the closest ship so
I want you to high tail it over
there and hear what he has to say.
Get the lay of the land, If the
Empire becomes unstable, it could
mean trouble for the entire
quadrant.

PICARD
Understood.

JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEEN)
We're sending you all the
intelligence we have, but it's not
much.  I don't need to tell you to
watch your back, Jean Luc.

PICARD
Not with the Romulans.

JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
(smiles wryly)
The Son'a, the Borg, the Romulans,
the evil Soran and that pesky
Nexus.  You seem to get all the
easy assignments!

PICARD
Just lucky, Admiral.

JANEWAY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
Let's hope that luck holds.
Janeway out.

The transmission ends.

Picard sits for a moment, intrigued.  Then he goes to the
bridge

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard goes to his command chair:

PICARD
(to Helm)
Lay in a new course... Take us to
Romulus.  Warp eight.

The crew is shocked.

HELM OFFICER
Aye aye, sir.  Course plotted and
laid in...

RIKER
Romulus?

PICARD
I'm afraid the Opal Sea will have
to wait, Number One... Engage.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

And the Enterprise jumps to high warp -- disappearing in a
flash of dazzling light.  Yes!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - DAY

Data conducts a briefing for the senior officers.  Monitors
currently show an image of Romulus and Remus in orbit around
their sun.

DATA
As you can see the habitable half
of Remus is always in darkness
because, like Mercury, one side
always faces the sun.  Due to the
extreme temperatures on that half
of their world, the Remans live on
the dark side of the planet.

Various grainy and unclear new images appear to illustrate
Data's words:

DATA
Almost nothing is known about the
Reman homeworld, although
intelligence scans have proven the
existence of dilithium mining and
heavy weapons construction.

Very obscure images of Remans appear, the crew can barely
make out the monstrous figures:

DATA
The Remans themselves are
considered an undesirable caste in
the hierarchy of the Empire.

RIKER
But they also have the reputation
of being formidable warriors.  In
the Dominion War, Reman forces were
used as assault troops in the most
violent encounters.

PICARD
(grim)
Cannon fodder.

GEORDI
Then how did a Reman get to be
Praetor?  I don't get it.

RIKER
We have to assume he had Romulan
collaborators.

PICARD
A coup d'etat?

RIKER
The Praetor's power has always been
the Romulan fleet.  They must be
behind him.

Picard considers this.

PICARD
(to Data)
What have you learned about
Shinzon?

The images end.  There are no images of Shinzon.

DATA
Starfleet intelligence was only
able to provide a partial account
of his military record.  We can
infer he is relatively young and a
capable commander.  He fought
seventeen major engagements in the
war.  All successful.  Beyond that,
we know nothing.

PICARD
Well... it seems we're truly
sailing into the unknown.  Keep at
it.  Anything you can give me would
be appreciated.  Dismissed.

The meeting breaks up.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING LAB - DAY

The B-9 stares placidly forward.

We pull back and discover that computer conduits connect the
B-9's head to Data's head.  Geordi monitors the connection.

DATA
At present he serves no useful
function.  Dr. Soong created us to
become active and useful members of
society.  I do not believe he would
have wanted the B-9 to live out his
life in his present state.

GEORDI
I can't believe the Captain went
along with a memory download.

DATA
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9
was probably designed with the same
self-actualization parameters as
myself.  If my memory engrams are
successfully integrated into his
positronic matrix, he should have
all my abilities.

GEORDI
He'd have all your memories too.
You feel comfortable with that?

DATA
I feel nothing, Geordi.  It is my
belief that with my memory engrams
he will be able to function as a
more complete individual.

GEORDI
An individual more like you, you
mean.

DATA
Yes.

GEORDI
Maybe he's not supposed to be like
you.  Maybe he's supposed to be
just like he is.

Geordi completes his work

GEORDI
Okay... we're done.

Geordi removes the computer connections from between their
heads.  He carefully closes the panel in Data's head as:

DATA
(to B-9)
Do you know where you are?

B-9
I am in a room with lights.

He looks blankly at the console lights.

DATA
Can you remember our father?

B-9
No.

Data glances to Geordi.

DATA
Do you know the name of the Captain
of this vessel?

B-9
No.

DATA
Is that your final answer?

GEORDI
(to B-9)
Do you know my name?

B-9
You have a soft voice.

GEORDI
(gently)
Data, he's assimilating a lot of
programming.  Remember, he's a
prototype, a lot less sophisticated
than you are.  We just don't know
if his matrix will be able to
adapt.  Or if he'll be able to
retain anything.  We should give
him some time.

Data has been studying some circuitry in the B-9's neck.

DATA
What purpose does this serve?

GEORDI
(also examining circuitry)
It seems to be a redundant memory
port.  Maybe it's for provisional
memory storage in case his neural
pathways overload?

DATA
Dr. Soong must have found it
unnecessary in later versions.

GEORDI
It's possible the extra memory port
is interfering with the engram
processing.  Mind if I keep him
here and run some diagnostics?

DATA
No, I do not mind.

Data looks at the B-9 with a sort of sadness.

DATA
But I believe he will prove
incapable of performing higher
functions.

GEORDI
Don't give up hope, Data.  I know,
I know, you're not capable of hope.

DATA
(looking at B-9)
I am not.

Data stands.  The B-9 stands to follow.

DATA
No, remain with Commander La Forge.
He is going to try to make you
well.

The B-9 sits.  Data goes.  Geordi watches him go.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Enterprise is in orbit around Romulus.  Remus can be seen
in the distance.

PICARD (V.O.)
Captain's Log.  Stardate 47844.9.
The Enterprise has arrived at
Romulus and is waiting at the
designated coordinates.  All our
hails have gone unanswered.  We've
been waiting for seventeen hours.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew is tense.  Silence.

Worf, at tactical, slowly stretches his neck.  Trying to
release the tension.  It cracks.  Deanna jumps a bit.

RIKER
Why don't they answer our hails?

PICARD
It's an old psychological strategy,
Number One.  To put him in a
position of dominance and make us
uneasy.

RIKER
It's working.

PICARD
(to Deanna)
Counselor?

DEANNA
They're out there, sir.

Picard stands and walks to the viewscreen.  He gazes at
Romulus below and the black infinity of space beyond.
They're out there, Waiting.

WORF
Sir,  I recommend we raise shields.

PICARD
Not yet, Mister Worf.

RIKER
Captain, with all due respect to
diplomatic protocols -- the
Federation Council's not sitting
out here, we are.

PICARD
Patience.  Diplomacy is a very
exacting occupation.  We can wait.

DATA
Captain...

And on the viewscreen.

Shinzon's magnificent Reman Warbird, the SCIMITAR, decloaks
directly before the Enterprise.

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

Our first sight of this incredible ship is absolutely
breathtaking.

Shinzon's vessel combines the clean lines of the traditional
Romulan Warbird with unique weaponry and styling.  It is
huge, easily twice as large as the Enterprise.  And it is
aggressive.  Awesome in its power.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew gapes at the huge ship on the viewscreen.

RIKER
(slowly rising from his
chair)
My God...

WORF
(tense)
Should I raise shields?

PICARD
No!

WORF
Captain -- !

PICARD
(firm)
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.

WORF
(quickly analyzing
tactical display)
Fifty-two disruptor banks, twenty-
seven photon torpedo bays, primary
and secondary phased shields.

RIKER
She's not out for a pleasure
cruise.

PICARD
(grim)
She's a predator.

WORF
We're being hailed.

PICARD
On screen.

And the image on the viewscreen transforms to:

Shinzon's Viceroy.

He stands on the Scimitar's bridge.  The bridge is as unique
as the rest of Shinzon's ship.  Instead of the usual
mechanical clutter, this bridge is designed with an almost
Asian simplicity.  Like the rest of Reman design, it is spare
and elegant.

Since the Remans are more comfortable in the darkness, most
of the light comes from the three steadily pulsing warp core
relays which dramatically soar up through the floor of the
bridge.

The crew gazes at the bridge and the monstrous features of
the viceroy.

VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
Enterprise.  We are the Reman
Warbird Scimitar.

PICARD
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to --

VICEROY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
I am not Shinzon.  I am his
Viceroy.  We are sending transport
coordinates.

The transmission ends abruptly.  The Scimitar reappears on
the viewscreen.

RIKER
Not very chatty.

PICARD
Away team.  Transporter room four.

Picard, Riker, Deanna, Worf and Data head toward the
turbolift, energized now that the endless waiting is over.

INT.  SCIMITAR - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

The away team materializes in the most striking location on
Shinzon's ship: a large observation lounge.

It is a huge, empty chamber.  No furniture.  A simple Reman
mat on the floor is the only decoration.  At the very top of
the room there is a large, etched glass dome.

It is very dark.

They turn when Shinzon speaks from the shadows:

SHINZON (V.O.)
I hope you'll forgive the
darkness... we're not comfortable
in the light.

PICARD
Praetor Shinzon?

Shinzon moves toward them a bit, becoming slightly more
illuminated, the low light shining off his golden hair.

The crew cannot see him clearly in the dim light but it is
evident he is human.  Assuming that he was Reman, they're
surprised by this realization.

Shinzon just stares at Picard through the darkness for a
moment.

SHINZON
Captain Picard... Jean Luc
Picard... I don't mean to stare,
it's just -- well, you can't
imagine how long I've been waiting
for this moment.  I always imagined
you taller, isn't that odd?
(to Data)
You may scan me without subterfuge,
Commander Data.

Data scans him with a tricorder as:

PICARD
And you're not as we imagined you.

SHINZON
No?

WORF
You are human.

SHINZON
Commander Worf.
(he speaks in Klingon)
I greet you as a valiant warrior...
and as my brother.

WORF
(terse, in Klingon)
I'll save my greetings for a better
brother.

Shinzon laughs, maniacally.

PICARD
Why have you asked for our presence
here?

Shinzon does not answer.  He is staring deeply at Deanna,
moans softly.

PICARD
Praetor?

SHINZON
(quietly)
I've never met a human woman.

He slowly moves toward her, still hidden in the shadows.

DEANNA
I'm only half human.

SHINZON
Deanna Troi of Betazed.  Empathic
and telepathic abilities, ship's
counselor.  All of this I knew...
But I didn't know you were so
beautiful.

RIKER
You seem very familiar with our
personnel.

Shinzon moves even closer to Deanna, not taking his eyes from
her.

SHINZON
I am, Commander Riker...
(to Deanna)
... May I touch your hair?

PICARD
(firm)
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a
matter we were -- assured was of
great importance.  If you have
anything to say to us as
representatives of the Federation,
I suggest you do so now.

Shinzon continues to stare at Deanna.  It is strangely
seductive.  Almost disquieting in its intensity.  Deanna
handles it with grace, her level gaze never leaving his.

SHINZON
(softly)
On the world I come from there's no
light.  No sun.  Beauty isn't
important.  I see now there's a
world elsewhere.

PICARD
Praetor Shinzon.  We're not here to
discuss your lack of a social life.

SHINZON
(turning back to Picard)
Yes, I'm sorry, Captain.
(he smiles)
There's so much we have to talk
about.

PICARD
I would be interested to know what
we are talking about.

SHINZON
Unity, Captain!  Tearing down the
walls between us to recognize we
are one people.  Federation and
Romulan.  Human and Vulcan and
Klingon and Reman.  I'm speaking of
the thing that makes us the same.
We want peace.

Picard and the others are stunned.

SHINZON
I want to end the centuries of
mistrust.  I want to be your ally,
not your enemy.  As a first step I
propose we eliminate the Neutral
Zone and begin a free and open
exchange of goods and ideas.

PICARD
And the Senate supports you?

SHINZON
(dry)
I have dissolved the Senate.

A beat.

SHINZON
Right now, you're thinking this all
sounds too good to be true?

PICARD
Yes.

SHINZON
And you're wondering why the
Scimitar is so well armed.  Is this
the ship of a peacemaker?  Or a
predator?
(Picard is startled at
Shinzon's choice of
words)
... But you're also thinking the
chance for peace is too promising
to ignore.  Above all, you're
trying to decide if you can trust
me.

PICARD
Yes.

SHINZON
Then perhaps the time has come to
add some illumination to our
discussion.  Computer, raise
lighting four levels.

Lights shoot up around the room.

For the first time the crew can see Shinzon clearly.  Picard
actually gasps when he sees Shinzon's face.  The rest of the
crew doesn't understand his reaction.

SHINZON
Allow me to tell you a story that I
hope will clarify my position.
When I was very young I was
stricken with an odd disease.  I
developed a hyper-sensitivity to
sound.  The slightest whisper
caused me agony...

Picard watches him carefully.  Wary and strangely intense.

SHINZON
No one knew what to do.  Finally I
was taken to a doctor who had some
experience with Terran illnesses
and I was finally diagnosed with
Shalaft's syndrome.  Do you know of
it, Captain?

PICARD
You know I do.

The crew is dumbfounded at Picard's unusual reaction.

SHINZON
Then you know it's a very rare
syndrome.  Genetic.  All the male
members of my family had it.
Eventually I was treated.  Now I
can hear as well as you can,
Captain.

He steps toward Picard who holds his ground.

SHINZON
I can see as well as you can.  I
can feel everything you feel.
(He stops right before
Picard)
In fact, I feel exactly what you
feel.  Don't I, Jean Luc?

Picard stares at him with a mixture of realization and
curiosity.  It is as if Picard is looking into a strange,
remembered mirror: Shinzon's face is nearly identical to his
at that age.

SHINZON
Do you trust me now?

A beat.

PICARD
We need to talk, just you and I.

SHINZON
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow.
Just the two of us.  Or just the
one of us.

PICARD
You know I need to verify this.

SHINZON
I know.

The crew is utterly confused.  Their confusion turns to
outright shock when Shinzon calmly pulls out a Reman knife
and cuts his arm, drawing a little blood.  He hands the knife
to Data.

SHINZON
Tomorrow then, Captain.  We have so
much to discuss.

Picard touches his communicator pin:

PICARD
Picard to Enterprise.  Five to beam
out.

They dematerialize, the shimmering glow illuminating
Shinzon's features.  Picard's eyes never leave Shinzon as
the transporter effect ripples around him.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY

Beverly stands with Picard, Riker and Deanna.  The Reman
knife is under a protonmicroscope and other medical readouts
and analysis are visible.

BEVERLY
There's no doubt, Captain.  Right
down to your regressive strain of
Shalaft's Syndrome.  He's a clone.

A beat as the confirmation sinks in.

PICARD
When was he... created?

BEVERLY
About twenty-five years ago.  They
probably used a hair follicle or
skin cell.

PICARD
(touching head)
I think a skin cell's the more
likely of the two.

RIKER
Why?

PICARD
Believe me, Number One; I'm going
to find out.  Contact Starfleet
Command and inform them of the
situation.  I need to know where
the hell he came from.  Deanna.

He goes, Deanna following.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING

DEANNA
I would say he's been trained to
resist telepathy.  What I could
sense of his emotions were erratic,
very hard to follow.

PICARD
Is he sincere about wanting peace?

DEANNA
I don't know.
(she stops him)
Sir, the strongest sense I had was
that he's more than curious about
you.  He very much wants to know
you.
(she looks at him deeply)
The same way you want to know him.

PICARD
How could I not?

DEANNA
Captain, don't assume he's anything
like you are.  You should resist
the urge to think you know him.

PICARD
I not only know him, Deanna, I am
him... and he is me!

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - RIKER AND DEANNA'S CABIN - NIGHT

Riker is hard at work over a series of padds.  He has been
working for hours.

DEANNA
Will, you need to rest.
(he continues to work)
As ship's counselor, I'm
recommending you get me sleep.

Riker tosses a padd on the desk.  Rubs his eyes.  Looks up
her.

RIKER
Some honeymoon.

She smiles and goes to him.

DEANNA
We have time.
(she kisses him)
Come to bed.

She pulls him up.

RIKER
Imzadi, what am I going to do with
you?

They kiss deeply.  She pulls him across the room and they
fall into the bed.

It is passionate, erotic.  Her arms undulate around him
sensually... her fingers snake through his hair, but
something is wrong.  Riker's hair is now blond.

She starts back, her eyes growing wide.

Riker is gone.  She is now embracing Shinzon!

SHINZON
Imzadi.  This is so good.

DEANNA
No!

He caresses her face...

SHINZON
He can never know you as I know
you... He can never touch you as I
touch you.

DEANNA
This isn't real.

SHINZON
Can you feel my hands... are they
real?  Can you feel my lips, my
loins?

He kisses her neck -- but when he raises his head again.  It
is the monstrous Viceroy!  Holding her.  Caressing her.  She
is frozen in horror.  But is it the Viceroy at all?

Shinzon's voice seems to come from the Viceroy's lips:

SHINZON (V.O.)
I'm with you, Imzadi...

And then it is Shinzon again, kissing her:

SHINZON
I'll always be with you now.  Now
and forever...

DEANNA
You sick bastard!

She pushes him away...

RIKER
Deanna?!  What's with the name
calling?

It is Riker.  She stares at him, then clings to him
desperately.

EXT.  ROMULAN SENATE - DAY

The Byzantine splendors of the Senate loom before us.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - DAY

Heavy drapes are drawn against any hint of the sun.  Shinzon
is in conference with the Romulan Commanders and Senator
Tal'Aura.  Commander Donatra watches him closely.

Commander Suran is angry, pacing.  Shinzon stands.  His
Viceroy lurks in a corner.

SURAN
... then I don't understand the
reason for the delay!

SHINZON
You don't have to understand.

SURAN
And bringing the Enterprise here?!
What possible purpose could that
serve?!

SHINZON
I have a purpose.

SURAN
Then perhaps you will enlighten us?

SHINZON
(snaps)
Silence, Romulan!

A tense beat.  Shinzon regains his composure.

SHINZON
You must learn patience, Commander.
Do you know where I learned it?  In
the dilithium mines of Remus.
Spend eighteen hours every day
under the lash of a Romulan guard's
whip and you'll soon understand
patience.

SURAN
(carefully bows his head)
Praetor.

SHINZON
Now go.  I have some personal
business.

Suran and the others go.

Donatra turns just as she is leaving the chamber, she sees
the Viceroy going to Shinzon.  And then do something odd.
The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest, leans very
close and talks to him quietly.  This is an ancient form of
Reman telepathic medical diagnosis.

This strange sight perplexes Donatra.  The doors close,
blocking her view...

INT.  SENATE - CORRIDOR - FOLLOWING

We go with Donatra and the other Romulans.  Donatra speaks
quietly to Suran:

DONATRA
How long before he has us in the
dilithium mines?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - DAY

The B-9 sits placidly in a chair, staring forward.

Then, as if a switch was thrown, he moves.  He quickly rises
and goes to a computer console.  He efficiently starts
punching in commands at an amazing velocity.

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Picard and Shinzon sit alone in a corner of the sweeping
Senate chamber.  The remains of dinner before them.

SHINZON
And when I was ready they were
going to replace you with me, an
exact biological duplicate.  Put a
Romulan agent at the heart of
Starfleet to influence your command
structure.  It was a bold plan.

PICARD
What happened?

SHINZON
As happens so frequently here on
Romulus, a new government came to
power.  They decided to abandon the
plan -- frankly, I think they were
afraid I'd be discovered and it
would lead to war.  They weren't
ready for that.

Picard pours a glass of Romulan ale.

SHINZON
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised.  I
can't stand it.

PICARD
(smiles)
You'll acquire a taste for it.

A beat.  They look at each other.

SHINZON
It's not quite the face you
remember.

PICARD
Not quite.  I envy the hairline.

SHINZON
A lifetime of violence will do
that.  My nose was broken four
times.  And my jaw... But so much
is the same.  The eyes, you
recognize the eyes.

PICARD
Yes.  The eyes have it.

SHINZON
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't
they?  Yours are so confident.

PICARD
How did you end up on Remus?

SHINZON
They sent me there to die.  How
could a mere human survive the
dilithium mines?  It was...
(he can't find the words)
... I was a slave.  And a monster.
The only thing the Romulan guards
hated more than the Remans was me.
But one man took pity on me: the
man who became my Viceroy.  He
taught me how to survive.  And in
that dark place, where there was
nothing of myself, I found my Reman
brothers.  They showed me the only
kindness I ever knew.

A beat.  He glances to the Romulan crest on the wall.

SHINZON
For thousands of years the Romulan
Senate has met in this chamber and
dictated the fate of its sister-
planet... But the time has come for
us to live as equals.

PICARD
You're doing this to liberate the
Remans?

SHINZON
No race should be a slave to
another.

Picard is impressed with Shinzon's quiet words.

SHINZON
You don't trust me.

PICARD
I have no reason to.

SHINZON
Of course you do.  If you had lived
my life and experienced the
suffering of my people... you'd be
sitting where I am now.  At least I
hope you would.

PICARD
And if you had lived my life you
would understand that there is a
great responsibility in
representing the Federation.  I
can't let my personal feelings
unduly influence my decisions.

SHINZON
All I have is my personal feelings.
I wasn't raised with the ideals of
the Federation.  But I'm trying to
understand them now.  To live up to
them   To live up to you.

A beat.

SHINZON
I want to know where I come from.
The Remans gave me a future.  You
can tell me about my past.

PICARD
There's so much, and so much of it
is dull...

SHINZON
Were we always explorers?

PlCARD
No.  I was the first Picard to
leave Earth.  It caused quite a
stir, In fact.  But I had spent my
whole life...

SHINZON
(finishing the sentence)
Looking up at the stars.

PICARD
Yes.

SHINZON
And you dreamed about what was up
there.  About...

PICARD
(finishing the sentence)
New worlds.

A beat.

They both reach for a carafe of water at the exact same
instant.  Stop.

PICARD
After you, Praetor.

SHINZON
(smiles)
Age before rank, Jean Luc.

Picard smiles, pours a glass.

PICARD
So I'm not as tall as you expected?

SHINZON
I always hoped I would hit two
meters.

PICARD
With a full head of hair.

SHINZON
(smiles)
There is that.

A quiet beat.

PICARD
Shinzon... I'm trying to believe
you.

SHINZON
I know.

PICARD
If there's one ideal the Federation
holds most dear it's that all men,
all races, can be united.  From the
first time the Vulcans came to
Earth we've sought a future of
peace.  Nothing would make me more
proud than to take your hand in
friendship.  In time.  When trust
has been earned.

SHINZON
I'm honored to think I might
someday speak with such eloquence.

A beat.

SHINZON
In time, Jean Luc.

PICARD
In time.

INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - LATER

Picard is gone.  Shinzon sits, thinking.  His Viceroy enters.

VICEROY
This is a mistake.

SHINZON
He's gentler than I thought.  And
he has a sense of humor.

VICEROY
(stern)
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon.
We should act.  Now.  Time is
running out.

SHINZON
(snaps)
My time.  I'll spend it how I
choose.

A tense beat.

SHINZON
We'll return to the Scimitar.
Prepare yourself for the bonding.

INT.  ENTERPRISE  BRIDGE - NIGHT

Picard emerges from the turbolift.  Data, Worf and Geordi
wait at the bridge engineering station.

WORF
Sir, we've had an unauthorized
access into the main computer.

PICARD
Who was it?

GEORDI
It's going to take some time to
find out -- the data stream was
rerouted through substations all
over the ship.

PICARD
What programs were accessed?

GEORDI
That's what I don't get -- it's
mostly basic stellar cartography:
star charts; communications
protocols; some uplinks from colony
tracking stations.  It's not even
restricted material.

PICARD
(to Worf)
Set up a security program to detect
any unusual data stream rerouting.
If it happens again, we want to be
ready.

GEORDI
(grim)
There's something else.  I was
reviewing the sensor logs...
(he refers to some
readouts on his console)
When the Scimitar decloaked there
was a momentary spike in the
tertiary EM band -- there -- You're
not going to believe this but it's
Thalaron.

Picard is shocked.

INT.  SICKBAY - NIGHT

Picard stands, concerned, with Beverly, Geordi and Data.
Monitors showing Thalaron research are visible.

PICARD
... I thought Thalaron radiation
was theoretical.

GEORDI
Which is why our initial scans
didn't pick it up.  But he's got
it, Captain.

PICARD
As I remember, Thalaron research
was banned in the Federation
because of its bioqenic properties.

BEVERLY
It has the ability to consume
organic material at the subatomic
level.  I can't overestimate the
danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean
Luc.  A microscopic amount could
kill every living thing on this
ship in a matter of seconds.

PICARD
Understood.  Keep on it.  I need to
know what he has and how to
neutralize any threat.  Give me
options.

Picard goes.  Data thinks for a moment.

DATA
Doctor, will you excuse us for a
moment?  Geordi, please come with
me.

He and Geordi head out.  Beverly returns to some medical
displays showing Thalaron research, her expression deeply
concerned.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT

Picard is sitting at his desk, flipping through an old photo
album.  He stops and stares at one of the pictures deeply
troubled.  We finally see the photo: Young Jean Luc Picard.
A serious, unsmiling cadet at Starfleet Academy.  The face
before him bears a disturbing resemblance to Shinzon.

The door comm chirps.

PICARD
Come...
(Beverly enters)
... Beverly, come in.

BEVERLY
You're working late.

She sits, notes the picture of Young Jean Luc.

PICARD
Remember him?

BEVERLY
He was a bit proud as I recall.

PICARD
He was a damn fool.  Selfish and
ambitious.  Very much in need of
seasoning.

BEVERLY
He turned out all right.

He rises, goes to a window, gazes at the Scimitar in the
distance.  A beat.

PICARD
I so wanted to believe Shinzon.
But the Thalaron radiation can't be
explained away.  Whatever he's
after, it's not peace.

BEVERLY
Is he very much like you were?

PICARD
Yes.

Data interrupts on comm:

DATA (V.O.) (ON COMM)
Data to Captain Picard.  Geordi and
I have identified the source of the
unauthorized computer access.  And,
I believe, we have also discovered
an opportunity to gain a tactical
advantage.

PICARD
(to comm)
On my way...

BEVERLY
(stands)
Jean Luc -- whatever you were --
right now you're the man you've
made yourself.  He's someone else.

PICARD
I wish I could believe that,
Doctor.

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - TURBOLIFT - MORNING

Deanna is alone on the turbolift.  Then a voice makes her
spin:

SHINZON (V.O.)
Imzadi...

Shinzon stands across from her.

DEANNA
You're not here.

SHINZON
(moving to her)
Very logical, Deanna... But your
heart doesn't constrain itself to
mere logic.
(he caresses her)
... Your heart longs to discover
me.  To know me...
(he kisses her)
... To leave all of this behind and
be with me.

He pushes her against the wall, with passion and almost
violence.

DEANNA
No...

SHINZON
I can feel your desire, Deanna...

She forces herself to concentrate... to resist
telepathically... it is a mighty effort... this Romulan is
hot.  And the world around her appears to be changing...
bending...

And she is momentarily in a cabin on the Scimitar.  Although
entirely a telepathic experience, it is as if she has
actually traveled.

She sees Shinzon kneeling over a small flame, she realizes
she is looking through the Viceroy's eyes.

On the Scimitar, Shinzon looks up at the Viceroy Deanna:

SHINZON
I can feel your hunger to know the
Reman ways... the old ways.

Then the world changes again...

Deanna is on the turbolift.  Shinzon is pressed against her,
whispering:

SHINZON
Don't fear what you desire...

She forces him away from her and --

She is alone.  She sinks to her knees.  Overcome with
emotion.

INT.  SCIMITAR - VICEROY'S CABIN - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy, in a kind of trace, kneels before a small flame.
Shinzon kneels across from him.  The Viceroy raises his head.

VICEROY
The bond is broken.

SHINZON
Find her again.

VICEROY
No -- this is wasting time.

SHINZON
Do as I tell you!

A Reman officer interrupts on comm:

REMAN OFFICER (V.O.)
Praetor, we've received the
transponder signal.

SHINZON
(to comm)
On my way.

He begins to go -- but suddenly stops, a wave of illness
overtaking him.

The Viceroy puts his hand on Shinzon's chest.  A strange
moment as the Viceroy shuts his eyes and feels Shinzon's
chest.  His mind... probing.

Then the Viceroy looks up at him, grim.

VICEROY
It's accelerating.  You have no
more time for games.

SHINZON
Have the doctors prepare.  I'll be
on the bridge.

He goes.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - DAY

Shinzon stands with some REMAN ENGINEERS.

SHINZON
Transport.

An Engineer activates a transporter and the B-9 materializes!

SHINZON
Welcome home.
(to Engineers)
Begin the download.

Reman engineers go to the B-9 and open the panel in his neck,
begin connecting computer conduits to the extra memory port
we saw earlier.

(Note: Although the audience will not know it yet, this is
actually Data pretending to be the B-9.)

Shinzon goes to a replicator unit and orders:

SHINZON
Tea, hot.

A cup of tea appears.  He takes it and sips as he watches his
Engineers connecting the conduits to the B-9.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - DAY

Beverly is scanning Deanna.  Picard and Riker watch,
concerned.

BEVERLY
Aside from slightly elevated
adrenalin and serotonin levels,
you're completely normal.

PICARD
(gently)
Can you describe it, Deanna?

She looks at Picard, tears in her eyes.

DEANNA
It was... a violation.

Riker takes her hand.

DEANNA
(with difficulty)
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the
ability to reach into my thoughts.
I've become a liability... I
request to be relieved of my
duties.

PICARD
Permission denied.  If you can
possibly endure any more of these
assaults.  I need you at my side.
Now more than ever I...

But before the words are out of his mouth... he begins to
dematerialize!

RIKER
(to comm)
Worf!  Raise Shields !

But Picard is gone.

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Scimitar cloaks.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIG - NIGHT

Picard stands in the Reman brig.  His communicator pin has
been removed.

Beyond the security force field a ghoulish medical apparatus
is being prepared.  A metal chair with laser scalpels, IV
tubes and hyposprays connected to it.  Reman doctors work
over the mysterious chair.

Shinzon enters with the B-9 following.  Shinzon stands on the
other side of the force field.

Picard notices something immediately.  Tiny veins are now
visible on Shinzon's face; the faintest sign of an intricate
spider-web pattern of pale blue veins.

SHINZON
Hello, Jean Luc.

PICARD
Why am I here?

SHINZON
I was lonely...
(he realizes Picard is
staring at the veins on
his face)
Perhaps I'm not aging as well as
you did.

He nods to a guard.  The guard deactivates the force field.
A Reman doctor enters and raises a hypospray toward Picard.

PICARD
(resists)
What are you doing?

SHINZON
I need a sample of your blood.
What do your Borg friends say?
Resistance is futile.
(maniacal laugh)

The Doctor takes a quick sample of Picard's blood as Picard
glances to the B-9.

SHINZON
Yes.  The bait you couldn't refuse.
I learned there might be an
existing prototype from a
Cardassian historian, then went to
a great deal of trouble to find it
and scatter it about on Kolarus
III.  I knew it would pique your
curiosity and conveniently make the
Enterprise the closest ship to
Romulus when I contacted Starfleet.

The Reman doctor leaves the cell.  The force field is
reactivated.  The doctor goes to the mysterious medical
apparatus and analyzes Picard's blood.  As:

PICARD
All of this so you could capture
me?

SHINZON
Don't be so vain.  After we found
it, we made a few modifications.
An extra memory port, a hidden
transponder.  Perhaps your eyes
will be a bit less confident when
you learn I've gained access to
Starfleet's communications
protocols.  I now know the location
of your entire fleet...
(to B-9)
... You may go.

B-9
Where?

SHINZON
Out of my sight.

The B-9 obediently leaves the room as:

SHINZON
Maybe I'll train it to do little
tricks for me like your robot does.
Or maybe I'll snap its ugly head
off.

PICARD
What's this all about?

SHINZON
It's about destiny, Picard.  About
a Reman outcast who --

PICARD
You're not Reman.

SHINZON
And I'm not quite human.  So what
am I?  What do you see?
(he peers at Picard
deeply)
Do you see a life you might have
led?  Lost youth never to be
recaptured?

PICARD
I see a young man trying
desperately to deny who he is.

SHINZON
I see an old man, set in his ways,
afraid to live without a uniform to
prop him up and a Starfleet
regulation to tell him what to do.
I see the man I will never be.

PICARD
I won't defend my life to you.

SHINZON
My life is meaningless as long as
you're alive.  What am I while you
exist?  A shadow?  An enigma?

PICARD
(stern)
If your issues are with me... This
has nothing to do with my ship and
nothing to do with the Federation.

SHINZON
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer
bow like slaves before anyone.  Not
the Romulans and not your mighty
Federation.  We're a race bred for
war.  For conquest.

PICARD
Think about what you're doing,
Shinzon.  Are you ready to plunge
the entire quadrant into war to
satisfy your own personal demons?

SHINZON
It amazes me how little you know
yourself.

PICARD
I'm incapable of such an act, and
so are you.

SHINZON
I think the facts speak for
themselves.  The same noble Picard
blood runs in our veins.  Had you
lived my life, you'd be doing
exactly as I am.  Look in the
mirror, and see yourself.

Shinzon looks at him deeply.

SHINZON
Consider that, Captain.  I can
think of no greater torment for
you.

He turns to go.

PICARD
It's a mirror for you as well...

Shinzon turns back to him.

A beat.  Picard gazes at him evenly.

Picard's probing gaze makes Shinzon a bit uneasy.  He glances
to the ghoulish medical preparations.

SHINZON
Not for long, Captain.
(back to Picard)
I'm afraid you won't survive to
witness the victory of the echo
over the voice.

He goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

The ship is on Red Alert.  Worf stands at tactical, muscles
coiled, hungry for action.

WORF
No response to our hails.

Geordi is hard at work at the Science station.  Riker stands
over him:

GEORDI
(frustrated)
His cloak is perfect... no tachyon
emissions, no residual antiprotons.

RIKER
Keep at it, Geordi.  Find a way in.

Beverly arrives on the bridge, urgent.  She carries a medical
padd.

BEVERLY
Will, I need to talk to you.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIG - NIGHT

Picard stands in his cell, peering at the edges of the
security force field, trying to spot any weakness.

Then the B-9 enters the brig, he holds a Reman disruptor
weapon.

B-9
(to Reman guard)
I am to take the prisoner to the
Praetor.

The Reman Guard deactivates the force field.

B-9
If you resist, I will incapacitate
you.

He leads Picard out.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

The B-9 leads Picard through the dark corridors, holding the
disruptor on him steadily.  All the Remans they pass glare at
Picard with undisguised loathing.

The Viceroy approaches.  Stops before them.

VICEROY
(to B-9)
Where are you taking him?

B-9
Praetor Shinzon wants him on the
bridge.

The Viceroy turns his malevolent gaze on Picard.

VICEROY
So, human... you've met your better
self!

PICARD
What are you doing to Counsellor
Troi?

VICEROY
I'm preparing her for Shinzon... To
sooth him as she soothes you.  To
stand at his side as she does at
yours.

PICARD
That will never happen.

VICEROY
Listen to him, android.  Such a
small and weak creature.  Yet he
roars so valiantly...
(he raises one taloned
claw and puts a sharp
fingernail on Picard's
chest)
It would take me but an instant to
tear that valiant heart from your
chest.

PICARD
There'll be another after me.  And
another after that.  You'll find
we're a resilient species.

VICEROY
I look forward to the sport.
(to the B-9, harshly)
Take him.

The B-9 prods Picard's back roughly with the disruptor.
Picard grimaces in pain

B-9
Move.

The Viceroy continues away down the corridor.  The B-9 leads
Picard along.

PICARD
(whispers)
Be careful of over-playing your
part, Commander!

And the audience now realizes it is Data pretending to be the
B-9 and rejoices.

DATA
Sorry, sir.  I thought it added a
touch of reality to the
performance.

They are silent as they pass a few Reman guards.  Then:

DATA
My mission was a success, sir.  I
have discovered the source of the
Thalaron radiation.

PICARD
Good work.  The download?

DATA
He believes he has our
communications protocols.  But they
will give him inaccurate locations
for all Starfleet vessels.

Data assumes the B-9's posture again as they pass some some
Reman Warriors.

DATA
Move, puny human animal.

They pass the Warriors.

PICARD
A bit less florid, Data.

DATA
Aye, sir... This way.

He leads Picard down the corridor.

INT.  SCIMITAR - GENERATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

Data leads Picard into a massive chamber that soars up like a
cathedral.  It is the size of a small town.

The whole, cavernous chamber pulses with glowing green light.

DATA
This entire ship is, essentially, a
flying Thalaron generator.
(he points up)
All its power relays lead to that
device.

High above them, at the very top of the chamber, is a
gigantic version of the spider-weapon we saw kill all the
Romulan Senators before.  It is breathtaking.

PICARD
A weapon.

DATA
It would appear so.

Data rotates his left hand and then slides it forward,
exposing a hidden compartment in his wrist.  He removes a
small, silver disc.  This is a cool new piece of Federation
technology called an ETU.  (Emergency Transport Unit.)

DATA
Geordi equipped me with the
prototype for the Emergency
Transport Unit.  I recommend you
use it to return to the Enterprise.

PICARD
It'll only work for one of us.

DATA
Yes, sir.

PICARD
We'll find a way off together.
Recommendations?

DATA
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters
from our current location.

Data inserts the ETU back into his wrist and they leave the
chamber.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - NIGHT

The Viceroy arrives on the bridge, stops.

VICEROY
Where's Picard?

Shinzon looks at him, confused.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - NIGHT

Security alert klaxons suddenly begin to howl and harsh Reman
commands are broadcast through the corridors.

DATA
This way, sir!

They sprint down the twisting, dark corridors -- Reman
warriors suddenly appear before them! -- Data fires the
disruptor as Picard launches himself into them --

A fight -- Picard uses a dazzlinq series of Starfleet hand-
to-hand maneuvers -- he dramatically subdues the Remans.

More Reman warriors appear down the corridor.  Picard grabs a
disruptor.

And instantly spins to fire a blazing disruptor.  A battle
breaks out in the corridor -- the energy beams and explosions
illuminating the violent fire fight in strobe-like bursts.

They run to another corridor and finally arrive at the
shuttlebay door -- it does not open.

DATA
(looking at door security
panel)
It seems to have an encrypted
security system.

Reman warriors are closing in on them.

Data tosses his disruptor to Picard -- Picard catches it and
instantly spins and fires -- he uses both disruptors to fire
down both ends of the corridor like a Western sheriff --
keeping the Remans at bay --

As Data uses both hands to punch numbers into the shuttlebay
door security panel at an amazing rate --

PICARD
Alacrity would be appreciated,
Commander.

DATA
They are trying to override the
access codes.  Reman is really a
most complex language with
pictographs representing certain
verb roots and --

PICARD
While I find that fascinating,
Data, we really need that Goddamned
door open!

The shuttlebay door slides open.

Picard lays down a blistering barrage of cover fire as he and
Data duck into the shuttlebay.

INT.  SCIMITAR - SHUTTLEBAY - FOLLOWING

When the door closes behind them, Picard turns and fires a
disruptor blast -- sealing the door mechanism.

They turn to face...

A fleet of very small shuttles.  They are uniquely designed.
Extremely compact and stream-lined.  A disruptor turret on
each.

They move toward one as:

DATA
According to the ship's manifest
they are Scorpion-class attack
fliers.

They quickly climb a Scorpion.

INT.  SCORPION COCKPIT - SHUTTLEBAY - FOLLOWING

The cockpit of the Scorpion is cramped.  Picard climbs into
the pilot's position.  Data assumes the gunner's position.

They see disruptor fire trying to burn through the door to
the shuttlebay -- Picard powers up the Scorpion as:

PICARD
(trying to figure out the
controls)
What do you imagine this is?

DATA
Port thrusters, sir.  Would you
like me to drive?

Picard shoots him a look and presses some controls.  The
Scorpion lifts off.  Hovers a few feet over the deck.  Picard
elegantly swings it around toward the large shuttlebay
external doors as:

PICARD
Can you open the shuttlebay doors?

DATA
(working controls)
Affirmative, sir.  Negative, sir.
They have instigated security
overrides and erected a force field
around the external portals.

PICARD
Well then... only one way to go.

He swings the Scorpion around again so it is facing the doors
they came through, the doors back into the ship.

Data is dubious.

DATA
Do you think this is a wise course
of action?

PICARD
We're about to find out... Power up
disruptors and fire on my mark.

DATA
Ready, Captain.

PICARD
Fire!

And the Scorpion's forward disruptors fire!  The doors into
the ship explode!  Picard powers forward!

INT.  SCIMITAR CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

And the Scorpion shoots into the corridor, past the stunned
Remans.  Picard banks sharply -- careens off the far side of
the corridor but keeps control.

The Scorpion zooms down the corridor.

INT.  SCORPION COCKPIT - SCIMITAR - FOLLOWING

Picard is concentrating intensely -- it is like trying to
control the world's fastest roller coaster.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDORS - FOLLOWING

The Scorpion banks around a corner --it zigs and zags through
the ship at breakneck speed --

INT.  SCIMITAR - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

The doors to the observation lounge EXPLODE in.

The Scorpion SHOOTS into the room and up --

A disruptor blast SHATTERS the etched glass dome at the top
of the room --

And the Scorpion ZOOMS triumphantly into space!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

The Scorpion seems to appear from nowhere -- slicing through
the cloak of invisibility around the Scimitar --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The crew sees the Scorpion appear on the viewscreen.

RIKER
Worf!  Lock on transporters!

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sees the Scorpion as well.

SHINZON
Tractor beam!  Now!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - SPACE

But they are too late -- the Scorpion dematerializes --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CARGO BAY - FOLLOWING

And materializes in one of the Enterprise's cargo bays.
Picard and Data climb out --

PICARD
(to comm)
Number One, emergency warp!

EXT.  OVER ROMULUS - FOLLOWING

The Enterprise dramatically powers forward and up -- rolling
over in a great arc going into warp while still upside down.
It disappears in a blaze of light.  Fade to...

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon sits in his command chair as the ship streaks through
space.  He speaks on viewscreen with his Romulan
collaborators.  His face is even more finely veined now.

SHINZON
The Enterprise is immaterial!  They
won't make it back to Federation
space.

SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
(angry)
This has gone far enough!

SHINZON
I thought we discussed patience,
Commander.

SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
And mine is wearing thin, young
man!  We supported you because you
promised action.  And yet you delay
and you waste your time playing
games with Picard while --

Shinzon stands and briskly pulls down his uniform tunic
exactly as we've seen Picard do a thousand times.

SHINZON
Commander Suran, the games are
over.  In two days the Federation
will be crippled beyond repair.
Does that satisfy you?

SURAN (ON VIEWSCREEN)
(grim)
For the moment.

SHINZON
(brutal)
And when I return... you and I
shall have a little talk about
showing proper respect!

INT.  ROMULAN SENATE - CHAMBER - FOLLOWING

The viewscreen picture of Shinzon snaps out.  The Romulan sit
for a silent beat.

DONATRA
Does anyone in this room harbor any
illusions about what he means by
"showing proper respect"?

TAL'AURA
What's happening to his face?

SURAN
I want opinions.  He is clearly out
of his mind.

SURAN
But can he complete his mission?

DONATRA
Should he?

They look at her.

DONATRA
Are you prepared to have your hands
drenched in blood?  He'll show them
no mercy.  And his sins will mark
us all for generations.  Is that
what you truly want, Romulans?

A beat.

DONATRA
I think you should consider that
question now -- or else you may
have a lifetime to think about it
in the dilithium mines.

She turns and stalks out.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - NIGHT

Beverly sits with Picard and Riker.

BEVERLY
The more I studied his DNA the more
confusing it got.  Finally I could
only come to one conclusion...
Shinzon was created with temporal
RNA sequencing.  He was designed so
that at a certain point his aging
process could be accelerated to
reach your age more quickly, so he
could replace you.

PICARD
But the Romulans abandoned the
plan...

BEVERLY
As a result the temporal sequencing
was never activated.  Remember, he
was supposed to replace you at
nearly your current age.  He was
engineered to skip thirty years of
life.  But since the RNA sequencing
was never activated, his cellular
structure has started to break
down.  He's dying.

PICARD
Dying?

RIKER
He wasn't designed to live a
complete, human life span.

PlCARD
Can anything be done for him?

BEVERLY
Not without a complete
myelodysplastic infusion from the
only donor with compatible DNA.
But that would mean draining all
your blood.

RIKER
That's why he went to all that
trouble to capture you.

PlCARD
How long does he have?

BEVERLY
I can't be sure but the rate of
decay seems to be accelerating.

Picard considers this.

PICARD
Then he'll come for me as a donor.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - DATA'S CABIN - NIGHT

Data stands before the B-9.

The B-9 has been deactivated, he stands lifeless and
immobile.  Data gazes deeply into his double's identical
features.  Then he opens a panel in the B-9's neck and uses a
small instrument to activate the android's head.

The B-9's eyes spring to life.  He looks at Data.

B-9
Brother.  I cannot move.

DATA
No, I have only activated your
cognitive and communication
subroutines.

B-9
Why?

DATA
Because you are dangerous.

B-9
Why?

DATA
You have been programmed to gather
information that can be used
against this ship.

B-9
I do not understand.

DATA
I know.

A beat.

DATA
Do you know anything about
Shinzon's plans against the
Federation?

B-9
No.

DATA
Do you have any knowledge of the
tactical abilities of his ship?

B-9
No.  Can I move now?

DATA
No.  I must deactivate you.

B-9
For how long?

DATA
Indefinitely.

B-9
How long is that?

A beat.  Data gazes at the B-9 deeply.

DATA
A long time, brother.

Data reaches forward and deactivates his brother.

The B-9's eyes lose the spark of life.  He stands, frozen.
Data stands before him.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE - NIGHT

Picard is gathered with his senior officers.

A computer display illustrates Geordi's words about the power
of Shinzon's weapon.  We see a chilling graphic of the
Biogenic Pulse beam spreading around a ship, then a whole
planet.

GEORDI
It's called a Cascading Biogenic
Pulse.  The unique properties of
Thalaron radiation allow the energy
beam to expand almost without
limits.  Depending on the radiant
intensity it could encompass a
ship... or a planet.

PICARD
(thinking)
And that's exactly what he's going
to do.

RIKER
Sir?

PICARD
His hatred of the Federation is
apparent.  He would have built a
weapon of that scope for one
reason.  He is going after Earth.

RIKER
Oh boy.  Destroy humanity and the
Federation is crippled...

PICARD
And the Romulans invade.

DEANNA
How can you be certain?

PICARD
I know how he thinks.

A beat.

RIKER
(to Geordi)
And there's no way to penetrate his
cloak?

GEORDI
No, sir.

RIKER
(frustrated)
He could pass within 10 meters of
every ship in Starfleet and they'd
never know.

BEVERLY
But we do have one advantage.
(to Picard)
He needs your blood to live.  He
might come after you first.

PICARD
I'm counting on it... We've been
ordered to head to sector 3274.
Starfleet is diverting the fleet to
meet us there.

RIKER
Strength in numbers?

PICARD
We can only hope so.

A beat as he looks at them gravely.

PICARD
He can't be allowed to use that
weapon.  All other concerns are
secondary.  Do you understand me?

Riker knows exactly what Picard is saying: the Enterprise is
expendable.

RIKER
Yes, sir.

Picard stands.  Presses a comm button.

PICARD
All hands.  Battle stations.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - VARIOUS ANGLES

We see a montage of the Enterprise preparing for battle.

Crew members assume battle stations.  Weapons locker ring
open and Security Officers hand out sidearms and phaser
rifles.

Geordi and his Engineers establish emergency force field
around the warp core.

Riker and Worf brief officers on tactical plans...

Data works at the bridge Science Station, analyzing data on
Shinzon's ship.

Picard walks through the corridors, he stops to talk with
apprehensive young ensign.

As we hear:

PICARD (V.O.)
Captain's Personal Log.
Supplemental.  We're heading toward
Federation space at maximum warp.
The crew has responded with the
dedication I've come to expect of
them.  And like a thousand other
commanders on a thousand other
battlefields throughout history, I
wait for the dawn.

The montage ends as...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - SICKBAY - NIGHT

Picard enters sickbay.

Dr. Crusher and her medical staff are hard at work.  They
position anti-grav gurneys and ready medical supplies.
Security officers are handing out phasers.

Picard watches the grim preparations.  Beverly goes to him,
bolstering her phaser.

PICARD
(quietly)
To seek out new life and new
civilizations.  Zephyr Cochran's
own words.  When Charles Darwin set
out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his
journey into the unknown... he
sailed without a single musket.

BEVERLY
(gently)
That was another time.

PICARD
How far we've come.  Let me know if
you need anything.

He starts to go --

BEVERLY
Jean Luc...
(he stops)
... He is not you.

A beat.

PICARD
What makes us who we are, Doctor?
Can you tell me that?

She watches him go.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon sits in his command chair, lined with veins now.
His Viceroy again has his hand pressed to Shinzon's chest.

SHINZON
How long?

VICEROY
A matter of hours now --

Shinzon shoves him away.  Stands.

VICEROY
If you don't begin the procedure
soon you'll never make it back to
Romulus.  You shouldn't have
delayed.  You should have killed
Picard the moment --

Shinzon slams his command chair in fury.  The Viceroy watches
him carefully.

A beat.  Shinzon regains his composure.  He sits again in his
command chair.

SHINZON
How long until we reach the Rift?

VICEROY
(checks a console)
Seven minutes.

Shinzon leans back, satisfied.  And looks at the viewscreen.

The image on the viewscreen is shocking.

The Enterprise only a few hundred yards away.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACE

The Enterprise zooms through space.

Completely unaware of the predator directly above it.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - ASTROMETRICS - NIGHT

Data is at work in Astrometry.  Cartographic projections of
star systems ebb and flow on a large screen before him.
Picard enters.

PICARD
Show me our current position.

The images before them quickly change to show another sector
and a blip representing the Enterprise.

PICARD
How long until we reach the fleet?

DATA
At our current velocity we will
arrive at sector 3274 in
approximately 40 minutes.

The images before them change to show sector 3274.  We see
blips denoting Starfleet ships moving into position.
Picard gazes at the projection of stars before them for a
moment.

PICARD
(quietly)
"For now we see but through a glass
darkly..."  He said he's a mirror.

DATA
Of you?

PICARD
Yes.

DATA
I do not agree.  Although you share
the same genetic structure, the
events of your life have created
unique individual.

PICARD
But so much is the same.  On a
biological level he is... and I
will not accept the idea that there
is nothing I can do.  I have a
responsibility to try to make a
human connection with him.

DATA
He would deny a "human" connection
is possible.  He considers himself
entirely Reman.

PICARD
He may have already rejected my
humanity, but you also have a twin.

DATA
No, sir, it is not possible.  The
B-9 is physically identical to me,
although his neural pathways are
not as advanced.  But even if they
were, he would not be me.

PICARD
How can you be sure?

DATA
I aspire, sir.  To be better than I
am.  The B-9 does not.  Nor does
Shinzon.

A beat.

PICARD
We'll never know what Shinzon might
have been.  Had he stood where I
did as a child?  And looked up at
the stars.

Picard's words linger in the air for a moment.

Then the projections before them sputter with static for a
moment.  Flickering.

DATA
(working controls)
We are passing through the Bassen
Rift.  The projections will return
when we have cleared it.

PICARD
It's interfering with our uplink
from Starfleet cartography?

DATA
Yes, sir.  The Rift effects all
long-range communications --

PICARD
(urgent, to comm)
Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!

Too late.

The ship QUAKES -- a photon torpedo blast -- the Enterprise
is under attack!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

Disruptor beams appear from nowhere -- streaking through
space -- slamming into the Enterprise's warp drive.  The
Enterprise recoils, dangerously dropping out of warp in a
furious lurch.

The Bassen Rift is a strange area of electromagnetic
distortion.  Energy patterns crackle through space.

INT.  SCIMITAR BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sits in his command chair.  The viewscreen shows the
Enterprise before him.

SHINZON
Target weapons systems and shields.
I don't want the Enterprise
destroyed.

On the viewscreen, we see disruptor blasts streaking from the
Scimitar -- slicing into the Enterprise.

SHINZON
Can you learn to see in the dark,
Captain?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard and Data emerge from the turbolift as the ship
ROCKS --

PICARD
Report.

RIKER
He's firing through his cloak.  We
can't get a lock.

GEORDI
(at engineering station)
He disabled our warp drive with his
first shot.  We've only got
impulse.

WORF
Long range communication is
impossible as long as we're in the
rift --

The ship SHUDDERS again --

PICARD
Worf, prepare a full phaser spread,
zero elevation.  All banks on my
mark.  Scan for shield impacts and
stand by photon torpedoes.

WORF
Aye, sir

The ship ROCKS again.

PICARD
Fire!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise fires her phasers simultaneously -- the energy
beams shoot into space --

And the Scimitar's shape is momentarily illuminated as one of
its shields is hit.

Photon torpedoes immediately shoot from the Enterprise -- but
pass harmlessly through the area where the Scimitar's shields
were momentarily illuminated.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

SHINZON
You're too slow, old man.
(entering commands in his
chair console)
Attack pattern Shinzon Theta.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The invisible Warbird makes a dramatic run straight over the
Enterprise -- firing steadily down as it sweeps past it; is a
brutal, close range assault --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The bridge SHAKES violently under the ruthless attack--

DATA
We are losing dorsal shields --

PICARD
Full axis rotation to port!  Fire
all ventral phasers!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise instantly complies -- Rolling completely over
to the left, firing phasers up as Shinzon's invisible ship
streaks above it --

A few lucky phaser shots from the bottom of the Enterprise --
now shooting upward -- manage to momentarily illuminate the
bottom shields of the Scimitar as it sweeps past above.

INT.  ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

WORF
Minimal damage to the Scimitar.

RIKER
(to Helm)
Defensive pattern Kirk Epsilon.
Geordi, get those shields online.

PICARD
(to comm)
Counselor Troi, report to the
bridge.

RIKER
Unless we can disable his cloak
we're just going to be firing in
the dark.

PlCARD
Agreed.

WORF
Sir, we're being hailed.

PICARD
On screen.

Shinzon appears on the viewscreen.  He is on the bridge of
the Scimitar.

SHINZON (ON VIEWSCREEN)
Captain Picard, will you join me in
your Ready Room?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM

Picard stands in his Ready Room.  A flickering light shimmers
across the room.  And a perfect holographic representation of
Shinzon appears before him.

SHINZON
You can't trace my holographic
emitters, Captain.  So don't
bother.  And you can't contact
Starfleet.  We're quite alone.

PICARD
We are.

SHINZON
It's just the two of us now, Jean
Luc, as it should be... Your ship
and mine... You and me.

PICARD
Why are you here?

SHINZON
To accept your surrender.  I can
clearly destroy you at any time.
Lower your shields and allow me to
transport you to my ship.

PICARD
And what of the Enterprise?

SHINZON
I have little interest in your
quaint vessel, Captain.  If the
Enterprise will withdraw to a
distance of one hundred light
years, it will not be harmed.

PICARD
You know that's not possible.

SHINZON
I know... you'll all gladly die to
save your home world.

PICARD
(intense)
Look at me, Shinzon!  Do you feel
the blood pumping inside you?  Your
hands, your eyes, your nature, are
the same as mine.  Buried deep
inside you beneath the years of
pain and anger is a capacity you've
forgotten.  It's the one way our
mirror can reflect the two of us
exactly because it's the very thing
that truly defines us.  To be human
is to try to make yourself better
than you are.

Picard looks at him deeply, relentlessly refusing to give up.

PICARD
I know you as well as I know
myself, Shinzon.  There was a time
you looked at the stars and dreamed
of what might be.

SHINZON
(quietly)
Long ago.

PICARD
Not so long.

SHINZON
Childish dreams, Captain.  Lost in
the dilithium mines of Remus.  I'm
what you see now.

PICARD
I see more than what you are.

Picard steps toward him.

PICARD
I see what you could be.

Shinzon slowly backs away as Picard continues to move toward
him relentlessly.

PICARD
The man who is Jean Luc Picard and
Shinzon of Remus won't exterminate
the population of an entire planet!
He is better than that!

SHINZON
(desperate)
He is what his life has made him!

Shinzon is in turmoil.  Picard senses this.  He proceeds
quietly:

PICARD
And what will he do with that life?

Shinzon looks at him, questioning.

PICARD
If I were to beam to your ship...
let you complete your medical
procedure, give you a full life...
what would you do with the time?

Shinzon doesn't respond.

PICARD
You once asked me about your past.
Your history.  When I was your age,
I burned with ambition.  I was very
proud and my pride often hurt
people.  I made every wrong choice
a young man can... But one thing
saved me... I had a father who
believed in me.  Who took the time
to teach me a better way.  You have
the same father.

SHINZON
Yes.

PICARD
So if I gave you my life, what
would you do with it?  Would you
spend the years in a blaze of
hatred as you are now?  Or could
you change?  Could you try to
remember a mother's touch you never
felt?  A father's words you never
heard?  Could you do that?

SHINZON
(quietly)
I don't know.

PICARD
But you want to.

Shinzon doesn't respond.  But Picard knows he has made a
connection.  For this brief moment reconciliation is
possible.  He proceeds quietly:

PICARD
Let me tell you about our father.

Shinzon looks at him with an aching sadness.  What might have
been.

SHINZON
That's your life... not mine.

PICARD
Please.

SHINZON
It's too late.

PICARD
You can still make a choice!  Make
the right one now!

SHINZON
I have no choices!  I can't fight
what I am!

Shinzon backs away, unable to fight his nature:

SHINZON
I'll show you my true nature.  Your
nature.  And as Earth dies --
remember that I'm forever Shinzon
of Remus!  And my voice will echo
through time long after yours has
faded to a dim memory.

Shinzon ends the transmission and his holographic image
flickers and fades away.

Picard stands alone, drained.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon strides quickly to his command chair, barking to his
Viceroy:

SHINZON
Disable their weapons!

But before the Viceroy can move the Scimitar suddenly ROCKS
-- attacked from somewhere!  Shinzon is stunned.

SHINZON
Report!

REMAN OFFICER
Two ships decloaking, sir!
Romulan!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard strides to his command chair as two Romulan Warbirds
appear on the viewscreen.  Deanna is now on the bridge.

RIKER
Believe it or not, I think the
cavalry has arrived.

WORF
We're being hailed.

PICARD
On screen.

On the viewscreen: Commander Donatra shimmers into view.

DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra
of the Warbird Valdore.  Might we
be of assistance?

PICARD
Your timing is impeccable,
Commander.

DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
The Empire considers this a matter
of internal security.  We regret
you've become involved.

PICARD
When this is over, I owe you a
drink.

On the viewscreen, the Valdore ROCKS from a disruptor blast.

DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
Romulan ale, Captain.  Let's get to
work.  Valdore out.

The transmission ends.

PICARD
(to Worf)
You heard the lady.  Get to work.
Move your ass!

(The Romulan Warbirds must remain decloaked to fire weapons
and are visible throughout the battle.)

Although Shinzon's ship is still cloaked, the steady barrage
of triangulated phaser and disruptor fire from the Enterprise
and the two Romulan vessels illuminate its shields with
impacts.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

PICARD
(to Worf)
Coordinate our attack with the
Valdore's tactical officer.
Triangulate fire on any shield
impacts.

WORF
Aye, sir.

The Enterprise ROCKS from a photon torpedo impact --

DATA
Aft shields are down to forty
percent.

RIKER
(to Helm)
Keep our bow to the Scimitar.
Auxiliary power to forward shields.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sits quite calmly in his command chair.

SHINZON
Target the flanking Warbird.  All
forward disruptor banks on my mark.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

It is a chaos of starships as the Enterprise and the two
Warbirds fire steadily -- illuminating the Scimitar's
shields.

The ships sweep around one another, maneuvering for position,
firing constantly.  The battlefield seems impossibly crowded
as the four vessels evade and attack; as phaser and disruptor
beams criss-cross space.

Then the Scimitar unleashes a devastating volley... all her
forward disruptor banks fire at once --

They literally cut one of the Romulan ships in half -- a huge
EXPLOSION -- debris SHOOTS across space and SLAMS VIOLENTLY
off the Enterprise's forward shields -- !

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The ship ROCKS dangerously!

DATA
Forward shields are down to ten
percent.

RIKER
(to Helm)
Bring us about!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise quickly turns about -- firing her aft phasers,
as the Valdore sweeps toward Shinzon's ship, firing --

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

SHINZON
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the
aft port quadrant and prepare for
full emergency stop.

VICEROY
(startled)
What?!

SHINZON
You heard me.

INT.  VALDORE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Donatra leans forward in her command chair, looking at
viewscreen.  She sees part of the Scimitar's rear cloakning
fall away --

DONATRA
She's losing her cloak!  Stand by
all forward disruptor banks!

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

VICEROY
She's almost on us.

SHINZON
Not yet.

On the viewscreen  we see the Valdore in pursuit, gaining.
The Reman crew is getting nervous.

VICEROY
Praetor...

SHINZON
FULL STOP AND FIRE !

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Scimitar LURCHES to a stop!  Too fast for the Valdore to
respond in time -- it flies over the Scimitar --

And the Scimitar fires!

A devastating volley of photon torpedoes rip into the
underbelly and aft of the Valdore as it streaks past --

The Valdore careens out of control and then slows to a stop.
It floats dead in space.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

SHINZON
Restore the aft cloak.and bring us
about.

He leans back in his command chair, ready for the final
battle.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

A bloody Commander Donatra is talking to Picard on
viewscreen.  Her bridge is in ruins.

DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
I'm afraid that drink will have to
wait, Captain.

PICARD
Do you have life support?

DONATRA (ON VIEWSCREEN)
For the moment.  But we're dead in
the water.

PICARD
Understood --

Then the ship ROCKS --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The invisible Scimitar sweeps past for a particularly brutal
assault -- disruptor blasts streak along the Enterprise's
hull -- a huge, ripping series of explosions tear away
several decks of the Enterprise --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

DATA
We have lost structural integrity
on decks twelve through seventeen,
sections four through ten.

GEORDI
Emergency force fields are holding.

RIKER
Evacuate those decks and reroute
field power to forward shields.

Deanna goes to Picard:

DEANNA
Captain -- I might have a way to
find them.

PICARD
Counselor?

DEANNA
The one thing he may have forgotten
in the course of battle: me.

PICARD
Make it so.

She quickly goes to Worf at tactical.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon is entering tactical commands in his chair console.

SHINZON
Prepare a lateral run -- all
starboard disruptors.

Then the viceroy suddenly stiffens, alarm in his eyes --

VICEROY
No!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Deanna concentrates furiously, eyes closed.  She stands with
Worf, her hand slowly moving his over the photon torpedo
targeting display.

It is a wrenching experience as she probes with her thoughts.

DEANNA
He's resisting me.

She is in pain.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy concentrates, trying to block her probing
thoughts.

SHINZON
What is it?!  Focus on your job!!!

VICEROY
She is here.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Deanna continues to move Worf's hand over the targeting
display.  She is sweating, panting for breath, concentrating
fiercely.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Viceroy resists her -- their psyches lock in battle.
Deanna appears in the Viceroy's mind, she glares at him.

DEANNA
Remember me?

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Her eyes snap open --

DEANNA
NOW!

Worf instantly fires a full volley of photon torpedoes.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

A full spread of photon torpedoes shoot through space.

And connect!  A series of devastating impacts -- and the
Scimitar's cloak fails!

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard stands quickly.

PICARD
Savage them!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

And the Enterprise attacks!

It fires all weapons simultaneously -- phasers and photon
torpedoes slam into the Scimitar!  Shinzon's ship responds
quickly -- maneuvering for position and returning fire!

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The bridge has been damaged, sparks sputter through the
darkness and debris litters the deck.

Shinzon eyes reflect a growing sense of desperation.

SHINZON
(spinning to his Viceroy)
Prepare a boarding party -- BRING
ME PICARD!

The viceroy strides out as Shinzon spins to another officer.

SHINZON
Get the cloak back!  And target
shield coordinates beta three.  All
disruptors.  Fire!

On the viewscreen, we see disruptor beams focusing on a tiny
part of the Enterprise's lower shields, slamming into them.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

DATA
Captain, we have lost ventral
shielding on deck twenty nine.

PICARD
Divert power and compensate --

An alarm klaxon suddenly rings through the bridge.

WORF
Intruder alert!

RIKER
Let's go.

Riker and Worf quickly head toward the turbolift as:

WORF
(to comm)
Security detail to deck twenty
nine.

Data immediately assumes Worf's position at tactical.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - LOWER DECKS - NIGHT

Riker and Worf stride with a SECURITY DETAIL through the
cramped lower decks.

A sudden disruptor blast stops them cold!  The Viceroy and
his invasion force of a dozen Reman Warriors are down the
corridor!

The Enterprise crew returns fire.  It is a blazing phaser
battle, Worf leading his men with Klingon courage.  They
steadily advance in the face of the blistering disruptor
fire --

They are getting the upper hand when Riker sees the Viceroy
escape into a Jefferies tube --

RIKER
Worf.

Worf instantly dives into the corridor -- landing hard and
sliding forward on his stomach all the while firing a steady
burst from his phaser rifle.

Riker uses the cover to dive after the Viceroy, following him
into the dark Jefferies tube, intent on destroying the man
who has been tormenting his wife --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The Scimitar sweeps into view on the viewscreen -- filling
the screen -- and launches a ferocious volley of photon
torpedoes.

A huge EXPLOSION as the viewscreen and some of the forward
bridge are BLOWN APART -- the Helm Officer is SUCKED INTO
SPACE before a flickering emergency force field springs into
position --

Deanna races to assume the helm --

Picard can now see his enemy directly through the gaping hole
in the ship's hull -- he sees the Scimitar banking for
another attack run as part of the ship disappears --

GEORDI
He's getting his cloak back.  We
have exhausted our compliment of
photon torpedoes.  Phaser banks are
down to four percent.

PICARD
What if we target all phasers in a
concentrated attack?

DATA
The Scimitar's shields are still at
seventy percent.  It would make no
difference, sir.

Picard thinks.

DEANNA
They're stopping...

Through the hole in the hull, Picard sees the Scimitar slowly
turning.  Slowly advancing.  They see another part of the
Scimitar disappear, the cloak returning.

GEORDI
What's he doing?

PICARD
(grim)
He wants to look me in the eye.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - JEFFERIES TUBE - FOLLOWING

Below decks, Riker stalks the Viceroy through a labyrinthine
series of access tunnels.  It is like a scene from ALIEN.

The flickering half-light and red emergency strobes of the
crippled ship make this an ominous sequence.  The Viceroy is
in his element, used to the perpetual night of the Reman
Homeworld, he can see in the dark.

Riker moves through the darkness, hunting for the Viceroy.
He stops, phaser ready.  He peers into the dark tunnel ahead
of him.  Sees nothing.  We tilt up and see...

The Viceroy clinging to the ceiling directly above Riker!
Hidden in the darkness.  The Viceroy attacks! -- diving down
on Riker -- his lethal Reman knife slashing through the
darkness --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard stands... watching the Scimitar maneuver into
position.  Large parts of it are now cloaked.

It stops.  Only a few hundred yards from the Enterprise, its
great prow almost filling the gaping hole at the front of the
bridge.

Picard thinks, his mind racing.  Then it comes to him in a
flash:

PICARD
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm
going to do...

GEORDI
Sir?

PICARD
We've got him!

He sits in his command chair and begins quickly entering
command instructions in his chair console.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon, supremely confident, leans back in his command
chair.

SHINZON
Open a channel.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard is still entering commands in his chair console.

DATA
We are being hailed.

PICARD
Deanna, stand by.
(to Data)
Open a channel.

SHINZON (V.O.)
I hope you're still alive, Jean
Luc.

PICARD
I am.

SHINZON (V.O.)
Don't you think it's time to
surrender?  I'll have my cloak back
in a matter of minutes and your
poor ship is shot to pieces.  Why
should the rest of your crew have
to die?

Picard continues to enter command codes -- transmits them to
Deanna at helm -- she receives the commands, nods.  All of
this as Picard buys some time:

PICARD
I never told you about my first
Academy evaluation, did I?  I
received very high marks for my
studies.  But I was found lacking
in certain other areas.
Personality traits, you might say.
In particular I was thought to be
extremely...
(he glares up at the prow
of the Scimitar)
... over-confident.

Picard indicates for Data to end the communication.  Then:

PICARD
(quickly)
Geordi, put 211 power to the
engines.  Take it from life support
if you have to -- everything you
can give me.

GEORDI
Aye, sir.

PICARD
Deanna, on my mark.

GEORDI
Ready, sir!

Picard leans forward in his chair:

PICARD
(on comm)
All hands, brace for impact!
(to Deanna)
ENGAGE.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Enterprise powers forward in a final thrust -- !

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon sees it coming -- utterly shocked -- bolts up --

SHINZON
HARD TO PORT !

Too late.

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

A massive COLLISION as the Enterprise SLAMS into the Scimitar
-- as it SMASHES and GRINDS into Shinzon's ship --

The Scimitar REELS --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Everyone goes FLYING!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The two great ships are now locked together, slowly rotating
in space.

The forward part of the Enterprise's saucer is enmeshed in
Shinzon's ship; two scorpions with their claws locked.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon stands in the ruins of his bridge.  Many of his
bridge crew are now dead.

SHINZON
Divert all power to engines.  Full
reverse!

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

Every part of the Enterprise ROCKS -- a great lurch as the
Scimitar begins to tear itself free -- backing away -- a
deafening shriek of metal -- both ships are being torn to
pieces in the process -- but it is working -- the Scimitar
is ripping free, wrenching itself loose.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - JEFFERIES TUBES - FOLLOWING

The Jefferies tube SHUDDERS as the Scimitar continues to tear
itself free -- Riker and the Viceroy careen through the tube.
The Viceroy recovers quickly and coils for a final attack.
Riker sees that an access plate has been loosened in the
collision -- he desperately rips it away -- knowing the
relays behind will provide him with the advantage he needs --

Bright light strobes from the relays and the Viceroy is
momentarily blinded -- Riker uses this opportunity to attack!
He dives forward -- slamming into the Viceroy -- they both
tumble into a long, vertical access tunnel -- they fall!

Riker shoots out a hand and grabs a ladder -- the Viceroy,
grabs onto Riker, his talons digging into his uniform -- a
long drop below them!

Riker forces the Viceroy's head back -- away from him -- a
brutal struggle --

Riker glares at him.

RIKER
Don't worry -- Hell is dark.

Riker uses every ounce of strength he has left -- pushes the
Viceroy off him --

The Viceroy falls down the long tunnel -- to his death.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

The whole Enterprise bridge QUAKES as the Scimitar continues
to pull itself free --

Picard stands, steadying himself on his command chair.

PICARD
Data, I need you.

Data joins Picard as:

PICARD
Computer.  Auto-destruct sequence
Omega.  Zero time delay.  Recognize
voice pattern Jean Luc Picard.
Authorization Alpha Alpha Three
Zero Five --

COMPUTER (V.O.)
Auto-destruct is off-line.

Then the ship gives a final LURCH.  The Scimitar is free.

An eerie moment of silence after the explosive tearing and
grinding.

Picard watches through the gaping hole in the hull as the
Scimitar backs away.  Another section of the Scimitar
disappears.  Shinzon almost has his cloak back.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Shinzon stares at the Enterprise.

A wave of sickness overcomes him for a moment, he doubles
over.  We actually see more veins appearing on his face.
Time is running out.

SHINZON
Target disruptors.  Destroy them.

REMAN OFFICER
Disruptors are off-line, sir.

A beat.  Shinzon looks up.

SHINZON
Deploy the weapon.  Kill everything
on that ship.  Then set a course
for Earth.

REMAN OFFICER
What about Picard?

SHINZON
Our greater goal is more important,
brother.

REMAN OFFICER
But, Praetor, you won't survive
without him...

Shinzon gazes at the Enterprise on the viewscreen.

SHINZON
Some ideals are worth dying for,
aren't they, Jean Luc?

EXT.  RIFT - SPACE

The entire Scimitar slowly begins to unfold.  Like a gigantic
version of the small spider-weapon we saw kill the Romulan
Senators before, legs appear and hoist up a savage weapon.
The Cascading Pulse.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard and the others watch the monstrous Cascading Pulse
weapon slowly deploying.

PICARD
How long until he can fire?

GEORDI
The targeting sequence should take
about four minutes.

DEANNA
But how can he?  He'll kill you.

PICARD
This isn't about me anymore.

Picard's face is set, resolute.  He knows what he must do.
Picard grabs a phaser rifle from a weapons locker as...

PICARD
Prepare for a site-to-site
transport.

GEORDI
(concerned)
Sir, we won't be able to bring you
back.  It's a one way trip.
Captain, I don't know if the
transporter --

PICARD
That's an order, Commander.

DATA
Sir, allow me to go.  You are
needed here.

PICARD
Negative.

DATA
Sir...

Deanna takes Data's arm.  Looks at him.  She knows this is
something Picard must do himself.

DEANNA
Let him go.

Picard powers up the phaser rifle as:

PICARD
(to Data)
You have the bridge, Commander.
Use all available power to move
away from the Scimitar.
(to Geordi)
Now, Mister La Forge.

GEORDI
Aye, sir.

Geordi nervously works some controls on his console and
Picard dematerializes.  Then the transporter panel explodes
in a shower of sparks.

GEORDI
That's it.  Transporters are down.

Data thinks for a moment.  Then:

DATA
Counsellor Troi, please assume
command.  Geordi, if you will come
with me.

He heads toward the turbolift, Geordi following.

INT.  SCIMITAR - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Several Remen warriors in the corridor turn and fire.  Riker
returns fire, a series of lightning fast pulses from his
phaser rifle.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - FORWARD CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Data and Geordi stand in a long corridor.  The far end of the
corridor opens to space.  An emergency force field is in
place at the end of the corridor.

Geordi operates a tricorder and another force field flickers
on around him.

Data looks toward the end of the corridor, readying himself.

DATA
What is our approximate distance?

GEORDI
(scans with tricorder)
400 meters.

DATA
Thank you.

Data backs up a little more   He looks at Geordi again.
Deeply.

DATA
Thank you, Geordi.  Deactivate the
field.

Geordi operates his tricorder and the force field at the end
of the corridor snaps off --

The void of space fills the corridor and Data takes a running
start -- he races down the long corridor and leaps --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

-- into space.

He floats toward the Scimitar, his momentum carrying him.
Carrying him too far!

He is going to miss the Scimitar -- almost past it now!  He
thrusts out a hand --

And just misses a piece of dangling wreckage!  Data is
floating helplessly through space.  Doomed.  Then he SLAMS
into an invisible piece of the partially cloaked on the ship!

He grabs onto the invisible part of the ship and pulls
himself up to the hull.  He rips open an access panel with
his superior strength and climbs inside.

INT.  SCIMITAR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Shinzon stands, his eyes glued to the Enterprise on the
viewscreen.

We see a monitor showing that the Cascading Pulse weapon is
locked on the Enterprise.

Most of the light on the shattered bridge now comes from the
three steadily pulsing warp core relays which soar up through
the floor.

COMPUTER (V.O)
Forty-seven.  Forty six...

Suddenly -- a MASSIVE BLAST as the doors to the bridge
explode in.  Shinzon spins to see --

Picard framed in the doorway, phaser rifle ready.

Picard instantly fires for the Cascading Pulse control -- but
Shinzon dives to cover it -- the phaser blast hits Shinzon in
the chest -- he recoils, slamming to the deck, stunned.

The few remaining Remans on the bridge spin to Picard, firing
disruptors -- Picard dives for cover and battles them with
his phaser rifle --

He succeeds in stunning the Remans but a final disruptor
blast knocks Picard to the deck -- the phaser rifle spins
away --

COMPUTER (V.O.)
Twenty nine... Twenty eight...

Shinzon pulls himself up and races to snatch up a disruptor
from a fallen comrade --

As Picard leaps up, grabbing a piece of wreckage, a long
metal rod -- Picard thrusts it forward like a spear --

Impaling Shinzon.

A stunned moment of silence as Shinzon gazes at Picard,
almost with a look of disbelief.  Blood spews from his mouth
as he lets out a tormented cry.

And then, amazingly, Shinzon forces himself forward --
pushing Picard back against a wall -- Shinzon slowly walks
toward Picard, forcing himself down the length of the spear
-- the spear point explodes through Shinzon's back -- the
weight of Shinzon's body is pinning Picard against the wall
-- time is running out --

COMPUTER (V.O.)
Eighteen... Seventeen...

Shinzon forces himself down the spear:

SHINZON
I'm glad we're together now -- our
destiny is complete.

He finally thrusts himself down the whole spear and clasps
his dying hands firmly around Picard's throat --

COMPUTER (V.O.)
Ten...Nine...

Data sprints to the bridge --

He instantly tears open his wrist and pulls out the small,
silver disc we saw earlier -- the Emergency Transport Unit --
he slaps it on Picard's shoulder.  A final look between
them --
COMPUTER (V.O.)
Seven..  Six...

Data activates the ETU -- Picard dematerializes.

Data looks at the space where Picard was and says simply:

DATA
Goodbye.

Then he spins and pulls out his phaser --

And fires point-blank into the Scimitar's warp core relays --
the bridge explodes -- Data is incinerated --

EXT.  THE RIFT - SPACE

The Scimitar BLASTS APART in a massive flash --

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

Picard re-materializes.

He sees the brilliant flash from the explosion through the
gaping hole in the front of the bridge.

Deanna sits at helm, her face a mask of pain.  Geordi stands
on the upper rear deck, head down.

A long beat as Picard just stands on his ruined bridge, the
thousand-yard stare of a combat veteran in his eyes.

Riker emerges from the turbolift.  Goes to Picard.

RIKER
Sir?

Picard doesn't answer, he just stares forward.  Deanna goes
to Riker.

DEANNA
Data.

Riker looks toward the glowing debris field in the distance.
He puts an arm around Deanna.

Silence.

GEORDI
Sir, we're being hailed.

PICARD
On screen...
(he remembers there is no
longer a viewscreen)
... Open a channel.

DONATRA (V.O.)
This is Commander Donatra of the
Valdore.  We're dispatching
shuttles with medical personnel and
supplies.

PICARD
Thank you, Commander.

The transmission ends.

PICARD
(flat)
Geordi... prepare the shuttlebay
for arrivals.  They don't know our
procedures so just... open the
doors.

GEORDI
I'll take care of it, sir.

PICARD
Number One.
(a beat)
You have the bridge.

He turns and heads toward his Ready Room.

The others watch him go with great sadness.

When the Ready Room doors close behind Picard, Deanna finally
allows herself to cry.  Riker holds her closely.  Slow fade
to...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CREW LOUNGE - NIGHT

Hours later.  The senior crew is solemnly gathered in the
shattered remains of the crew lounge.  Picard, Riker, Deanna,
Beverly, Worf, Geordi.

They wear their dress uniforms.

Picard goes to each of them.  He carries a small, metal box.
They each take something from the box.

At first we, don't quite see what they are doing.  Then we
realize they are affixing black bars to the collars of their
uniforms.

Mourning bands.

Picard pours six glasses of his precious Chateau Picard.
Each takes a glass.

Picard raises his glass.

PICARD
To absent friends... o family.

They toast Data.  Slow fade to...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - PICARD'S CABIN - NIGHT

Picard sits at his desk, speaking quietly to someone we do
not see.

PICARD
I don't know if all this has made
sense to you, but I wanted you to
know what kind of man he was.  In
his quest to be more like us, he
helped show us what it means to be
human.

We see it is the now re-activated B-9 sitting across from
him.

B-9
My brother was not a human.

PICARD
No, he wasn't... But his wonder and
his curiosity about every facet of
human life helped all of us see the
best parts of ourselves.  He
embraced change... because he
always wanted to be more than he
was.

B-9
I do not understand.

PICARD
Well, I hope someday you will.

Worf interrupts on comm:

WORF (V.O.) (ON COMM)
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived
to tow us to spacedock.

PICARD
On my way.  Please notify Commander
Riker...
(he stands, prepares to
go)
... We'll talk later?

The B-9 does not respond.  He is looking rather blankly at
the padd on Picard's desk.

Picard begins to leave when a sound stops him... humming.  He
turns back to the B-9.

The B-9 is still looking blankly at the padd... but he's
humming lightly to himself... then he begins to sing, very
softly...

B-9
"Blue skies, smiling at me, Nothing
but blue skies do I see."

Then the B-9 is silent.

Picard watches him for a moment; great emotion playing over
his features, and then goes.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Picard and Riker head toward a turbolift... making their way
past the debris littering the corridor.

PICARD
I'm sorry you won't be here for the
re-fit, but I know the Titan needs
you immediately.

Riker does not respond.

Picard stops, looks at Riker deeply.

PICARD
The Titan's a fine ship, Will.  And
she's getting a captain worthy of
her.

RIKER
She's the most beautiful ship I've
ever seen.
(he touches a wall of the
corridor)
... But she's not the Enterprise.

PICARD
I promise you in time, she'll
become your home... If I could
offer you one piece of advice?

RIKER
Anything.

PICARD
When your first officer insists
that you can't go on away
missions... Ignore him --

RIKER
(smiles)
I intend to.

A moment.

RIKER
(with difficulty)
Serving with you has been an honor.

PICARD
The honor was mine.  Captain Riker.

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACEDOCK - OVER EARTH

A few weeks later.  The Enterprise is enclosed in the great
womb of a spacedock.  The ship is being rebuilt.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

A fresh-faced young officer, COMMANDER MARTIN MADDEN, paces
nervously outside Picard's Ready Room.  Bracing himself
before entering.

Behind him we can see technicians working everywhere around
the bridge, trying to rebuild it.  Worf is talking to a young
officer at tactical and Geordi is working at the engineering
station.  We also see new command chairs being installed.

(Although we do not see it in this scene, the gaping hole at
the front of the bridge has not yet been repaired.)

A young Andorian woman, the new OPS OFFICER, smiles at
Madden's nervousness.  Her antennae twitch slightly in
amusement.  He sees her.

MADDEN
So... what's the old man like?

OPS OFFICER
Why don't you go in and find out?

Commander Madden prepares himself.

INT.  ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM - FOLLOWING

Picard is talking to Beverly on viewscreen.  She is in her
new office at Starfleet Medical.

BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
You can't imagine them, Jean Luc.
They're kids!  All with advance
degrees in xenobiology and out to
conquer every disease in the
quadrant.

PICARD
(smiles)
Reminds me of a young doctor I used
to know...

BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
They're running me ragged.  Nothing
but questions day and night... I
love it!  Come to dinner and I'll
tell you all about it.  There's a
Bajoran band at the officer's mess.

PICARD
Not tonight, I have work here.

BEVERLY (ON VIEWSCREEN)
Soon then.  I'll save the last
dance for you.

Commander Madden enters quickly -- he did not use the door
chime so Picard is surprised.

MADDEN
Commander Martin Madden reporting
for duty, sir.

Picard stands, they shake hands as:

PICARD
Welcome aboard, Commander.  I hope,
your transfer didn't come as too
much of a surprise.

MADDEN
I was... honored, sir.

PICARD
I needed you immediately to help
oversee the re-fit...
(gathering up some padds
from his desk)
... Your service record on the
Talos is exemplary, but there are a
few things I would like to discuss
with you regarding my requirements
for a First Officer.  Shall we say
dinner in my quarters at 1900
hours?

MADDEN
Very good, sir.

Picard heads toward the door, carrying a few padds.

PICARD
Commander, I don't know how they
did it on the Talos, but we have
door chimes on the Enterprise.  We
use them.

MADDEN
Yes, sir.  Sorry, sir.

Picard goes to the bridge, Madden following...

INT.  ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - FOLLOWING

They emerge to the bridge as Worf is arguing with the cocky
young ENSIGN busy installing Picard's new high-tech command
chair.

WORF
You don't understand the Captain --
there should be no changes until we
have discussed the modifications
with him.

Picard goes to them:

PICARD
What's this?

WORF
(grumbles)
Your new chair, sir.

ENSIGN
It's the Mark Seven, Captain.
State-of-the-art ergonomics...
command interfaces with --

WORF
I told him you're comfortable with
your old chair.

PICARD
Let's give it a try.

He settles into his new command chair.  Looks around for a
beat at his new bridge crew.  Fresh-faced kids.  A new
generation to teach and nurture.  He smiles.

PICARD
Feels good.

Worf and Geordi exchange a look, surprised.

ENSIGN
(points)
Try that button, sir.

Picard presses a button on the chair and -- zip -- metal
restraints fly into position around his waist and shoulders.
Seatbelts!  Picard is surprised.

A beat.

Then Picard smiles.

PICARD
It's about time.

He presses the button again and the restraints zip back into
the body of the chair.  He is delighted.  He turns to Madden:

PICARD
Commander, please sit down...

Madden sits in the First Officer's chair, Picard shares a
padd with him.

PICARD
... We've received our first
assignment.  We're going to be
exploring the Denab system.  It
should be exciting.  It's a
place... where no one has gone
before.

And we cut to --

EXT.  ENTERPRISE - SPACEDOCK - OVER EARTH - FOLLOWING

Through the hole in the hull we see Picard talking to Madden.
Picard at work, at peace.  Where he is meant to be.

We slowly pull back from Picard and the Enterprise.  As we
hear the B-9's soft tones.  Gentle.  Hopeful.

B-9 (V.O.)
"Never saw the sun shining so
bright, Never saw things going so
right.  Noticing the days hurrying
by, When you're in love, my how
they fly.  Blue days, all of them
gone, Nothing but blue skies from
now on."

We revolve away from the Enterprise and Earth toward the
stars.  Then ZOOM forward into the cosmos as the rousing
"Next Generation" theme explodes over END CREDITS.

FADE OUT.

EPISODE V: THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK


Written by

Lawrence Kasdan

and

Leigh Brackett


From a story by George Lucas





EXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTH

A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots
from its underside.

One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice-
covered surface.  An explosion marks the point of
impact.

EXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY

A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind.  A
strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the
smoke-shrouded crater.  The ominous mechanical probe floats across the
snow plain and disappears into the distance.

EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY

A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.  The bundled
rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun.  Curving
plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged
beast.

The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop.  Pulling
off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the
sky.  He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and
through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed.

The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink
transmitter.  His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.

LUKE
(into comlink)
Echo Three to Echo Seven.  Han,
old buddy, do you read me?

After a little static a familiar voice is heard.

HAN
(over comlink)
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?

LUKE
(into comlink)
Well, I finished my circle.  I
don't pick up any life readings.

HAN
(over comlink)
There isn't enough life on this
ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
The sensors are placed, I'm going
back.

LUKE
(into comlink)
Right.  I'll see you shortly.
There's a meteorite that hit the
ground near here.  I want to check
it out.  It won't take long.

Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard.
He pats the beast on the head to calm it.

LUKE
Hey, steady girl.  What's the
matter?  You smell something?

Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when
suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind.  He hears a
monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over
him.  It is a Wampa Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously.

LUKE
Aaargh!

Luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white
claw.  He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified
screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck
being broken.

The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away
across the frozen plain.

EXT. HOTH - REBEL BASE ENTRANCE - DAY

A stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance of an enormous
ice cave.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Rebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing
their new base.  The rider, Han Solo, swings off his lizard and pulls
off his goggles.

He walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium Falcon, which
is parked among several fighters.  Mechanics, R2 units, and various
other droids hurry about.  Han stops at the Millennium Falcon where his
Wookiee copilot, Chewbacca, is welding on a central lifter.  Chewie
stops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated
greeting to his boss.

HAN
Chewie!

The Wookiee grumbles a reply.

HAN
All right, don't lose your temper.
I'll come right back and give you
a hand.

Chewbacca puts his mask back on and returns to his welding as Han
leaves.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

A makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick
ice.  The low-ceilinged room is a beehive of activity. Controllers,
troops, and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and
monitoring radar signals.

General Rieekan straightens up from a console at Han's approach.

RIEEKAN
Solo?

HAN
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.  You'll
know if anything comes around.

RIEEKAN
Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

HAN
No.  He's checking out a meteorite
that hit near him.

RIEEKAN
(indicates radar
screen)
With all the meteor activity in this
system, it's going to be difficult
to spot approaching ships.

Taking a deep breath, Han blurts out what is on his mind.

HAN
General, I've got to leave.  I
can't stay anymore.

Princess Leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short
white combat jacket and pants.  Her hair is braided across her head in
a Nordic fashion.  She overhears their  conversation and seems somewhat
distressed.

RIEEKAN
I'm sorry to hear that.

HAN
Well, there's a price on my head.
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut,
I'm a dead man.

RIEEKAN
A death mark's not an easy thing
to live with.  You're a good
fighter, Solo.  I hate to lose you.

HAN
Thank you, General.

He turns to Leia as Rieekan moves away.

HAN
(with feeling)
Well, Your Highness, I guess this
is it.

LEIA
That's right.

Leia is angry.  Han sees she has no warmth to offer him.  He shakes his
head and adopts a sarcastic tone.

HAN
(cooly)
Well, don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

Han walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the command center.
Leia stews a moment, then hurries after him.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR

LEIA
Han!

Han stops in the corridor and turns to face Leia.

HAN
Yes, Your Highnessness?

LEIA
I thought you decided to stay.

HAN
Well, the bounty hunter we ran
into on Ord Mantell changed my
mind.

LEIA
Han, we need you!

HAN
We?

LEIA
Yes.

HAN
Oh, what about you need?

LEIA
(mystified)
I need?  I don't know what you're
talking about.

HAN
(shakes his head,
fed up)
You probably don't.

LEIA
And what precisely am I supposed
to know?

HAN
Come on!  You want me to stay
because of the way you feel about
me.

LEIA
Yes.  You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader...

HAN
No!  That's not it.  Come on.
Aahhh - uh huh!  Come on.

Leia stares at him, understanding, then laughs.

LEIA
You're imagining things.

HAN
Am I?  Then why are you following
me?  Afraid I was going to leave
without giving you a goodbye kiss?

LEIA
I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.

HAN
I can arrange that.  You could use
a good kiss!

Angrily, Han strides down the corridor as Leia stares after him.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ANOTHER ICE CORRIDOR

A familiar stream of beeps and whistles herald the approach of Artoo-
Detoo and See-Threepio, who appear around a corner and move along an
ice wall toward the main hangar.

THREEPIO
Don't try to blame me.  I didn't
ask you to turn on the thermal
heater.  I merely commented that it
was freezing in the princess'
chamber.  But it's supposed to be
freezing.  How are we going to dry
out all her clothes?  I really don't
know.

Artoo beeps a stream of protesting whistles.

THREEPIO
Oh, switch off.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

The two robots stop at Han Solo's space freighter.  Han and Chewie are
struggling with their central lifters.

HAN
(to Chewie)
Why do you take this apart now?
I'm trying to get us out of here
and you pull both of these.

Chewie grumbles in irritation.

THREEPIO
Excuse me, sir.

HAN
(to Chewie)
Put them back together right now.

THREEPIO
Might I have a word with you,
please?

HAN
What do you want?

THREEPIO
Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.
She's been trying to get you on
the communicator.

HAN
I turned it off.  I don't want to
talk to her.

THREEPIO
Oh.  Well, Princess Leia is wondering
about Master Luke.  He hasn't come
back yet.  She doesn't know where he
is.

HAN
I don't know where he is.

THREEPIO
Nobody knows where he is.

HAN
What do you mean, "nobody knows"?

Han glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice cave as
night slowly begins to fall on the planet.

THREEPIO
Well, uh, you see...

Han jumps down off the lift, as Threepio follows him.

HAN
Deck Officer.  Deck Officer!

THREEPIO
Excuse me, sir.  Might I inqu...

Han abruptly puts his hand over Threepio's mouth as the deck officer
approaches.

DECK OFFICER
Yes, sir?

HAN
Do you know where Commander
Skywalker is?

DECK OFFICER
I haven't seen him.  It's possible
he came in through the south entrance.

HAN
It's possible?  Why don't you go
find out?  It's getting dark out there.

DECK OFFICER
Yes, sir.

The deck officer leaves hurriedly, as Han takes his hand off Threepio's
mouth.

THREEPIO
Excuse me, sir.  Might I inquire
what's going on?

HAN
Why not?

THREEPIO
Impossible man.  Come along, Artoo,
let's find Princess Leia.  Between
ourselves, I think Master Luke is
in considerable danger.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN ICE TUNNEL

The deck officer and his assistant hurry toward Han as he enters the
tunnel.

DECK OFFICER
Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't
come in through the south entrance.
He might have forgotten to check in.

HAN
Not likely.  Are the speeders ready?

DECK OFFICER
Not yet.  We're having some trouble
adapting them to the cold.

HAN
Then we'll have to go out on
Tauntauns.

DECK OFFICER
Sir, the temperature's dropping too
rapidly.

HAN
That's right.  And my friends out
in it.

ASSISTANT OFFICER
I'll cover sector twelve.  Have
com-control set screen alpha.

Han pushes through the troops and mounts a Tauntaun.

DECK OFFICER
Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you
reach the first marker.

HAN
Then I'll see you in hell!

Han maneuvers his mount out of the cave and races into the dark bitter
night.

EXT. HOTH - ICE GORGE - DUSK

The jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of
a Hoth day.  Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy
stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor.  One
side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood.  He opens
his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the
gorge walls.  Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and
futilely tries to unfasten the throngs.

Exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position.  As he hangs there,
he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about
three feet out of reach.

He focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he
squeezes his eyes tight in concentration.

Just as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into
Luke's hand.

The young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts
himself loose from the ice.  He flops to the snow in a heap.  The
startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking.  Luke
scrambles to his feet.  He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams
in pain.

EXT. HOTH - ENTRANCE TO ICE GORGE - DUSK

Luke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy twilight.  Weak
and exhausted, he stumbles down a snow bank.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DUSK

A small, lone figure riding a Tauntaun races through the hostile
vastness of snow and cold.  As it runs, the Tauntaun's legs kick up
large clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air.

EXT. HOTH - OUTSIDE ICE     HANGAR - DUSK

Artoo stands in the falling snow, beeping worriedly.  Threepio moves
stiffly over to him.

THREEPIO
You must come along now, Artoo.
There's really nothing more we can
do.  And my joints are freezing up.

Artoo beeps, long and low.

THREEPIO
Don't say thing like that!  Of
course we'll see Master Luke again.
He'll be quite all right, you'll see.
(to himself)
Stupid little short-circuit.  He'll
be quite all right.

Threepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as Artoo mournfully
keeps his vigil.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK

The wind is blowing quite strong now.  Luke struggles to stay upright,
but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over.  He struggles to get up,
but he can't.  The young warrior from Tatooine drags himself a couple
of feet and then collapses.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Princess Leia stands inside the dark entrance to the Rebel base,
waiting for a sign of the two Rebel heroes.  She shivers in the cold
wind as, nearby, Chewie sits with his head in his hands.  In the
background, Artoo and Threepio move through the doors.

A Rebel lieutenant moves to Major Derlin, an officer keeping watch with
the princess.

LIEUTENANT
Sir, all the patrols are in.
There's still no contact from
Skywalker or Solo.

THREEPIO
Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals,
although he does admit that his own
range is far too weak to abandon
all hope.

Leia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought.

DERLIN
Your Highness, there's nothing
more we can do tonight.  The shield
doors must be closed.

He turns to the lieutenant.

DERLIN
Close the doors.

LIEUTENANT
Yes, sir.

The lieutenant walks away.  Chewie lets out a long, mournful howl,
somewhat like a coyote.  At the same moment, Artoo begins a complex
series of efficient beeps.

THREEPIO
Artoo says the chances of survival
are seven hundred seventy-five...
to one.

Leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the
entrance of the ice cave.  The loud booms echo throughout the huge
cavern.  Chewie lets out another suffering howl.

THREEPIO
Actually, Artoo has been known to
make mistakes... from time to time.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry
about Master Luke.  I'm sure he'll
be all right.  He's quite clever,
you know... for a human being.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK

Luke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious.  Slowly he looks
up and sees Ben Kenobi, barely visible through the blowing snow.  It is
hard to tell if Kenobi is real or a hallucination.

BEN
Luke... Luke.

LUKE
(weakly)
Ben?

BEN
You will go to the Dagobah system.

LUKE
Dagobah system?

BEN
There you will learn from Yoda,
the Jedi Master who instructed me.

The image of Ben fades, revealing a lone Tauntaun rider approaching
from the windswept horizon.

LUKE
(groaning faintly)
Ben... Ben.

Luke drops into unconsciousness.

Han pulls up and leaps off his mount.  He hurries to his snow-covered
friend, cradling him in his arms.  Han's Tauntaun lets out a low,
pitiful bellow.  But Han's concern is with Luke, and he shakes him
urgently.

HAN
Luke!  Luke!  Don't do this, Luke.
Come on, give me a sign here.

Luke doesn't respond.  Han begins frantically rubbing and slapping
Luke's unconscious face.  As he starts to lift the youth, Han hears a
rasping sound behind him.  He turns, just in time to see his Tauntaun
stagger and then fall over into the snow.

Han carries Luke to the moaning beast.  Then, with a final groan, the
Tauntaun expires.

HAN
Not much time.

He pushes Luke's inert form against the belly of the dead beast.

LUKE
(moaning)
Ben... Ben...

HAN
Hang on, kid.

LUKE
Dagobah system...

Han ignites Luke's saber and cuts the beast from head to toe.  He
quickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow, then lifts Luke's
inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass.

HAN
(reeling from the
odor)
Whew...

LUKE
Dagobah...

HAN
This may smell bad, kid...

LUKE
(moaning)
Yoda...

HAN
...but it will keep you warm...
til I get the shelter built.
(struggling to get
Luke inside the
carcass)
Ooh... I thought they smelled bad
on the outside!

The wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move.  Han
removes a pack from the dead creature's back, taking out a shelter
container.  He begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection
against a bitter Hoth night.

EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAWN

Four snub-nosed armored snowspeeders race across the white landscape.

INT. SNOWSPEEDER COCKPIT

There is only one pilot, Zev, in the enclosed two-man craft.  He
concentrates on the scopes which ring his cockpit.  He hears a low beep
from one of his monitors.

ZEV
(into transmitter)
Echo Base... I've got something!  Not
much, but it could be a life form.

EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT

The small craft banks and makes a slow arc, then races off in a new
direction.

INT. SNOWSPEEDER - COCKPIT

The pilot switches over to a new transmitter.

ZEV
(into transmitter)
This is Rogue Two.  this is Rogue
Two.  Captain Solo, so you copy?
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?
This is Rogue Two.

There is a sharp crackle of static, then a faint voice.

HAN
(filtered over
Zev's receiver)
Good morning.  Nice of you guys
to drop by.

ZEV
(switching transmitters)
Echo Base... this is Rogue Two.  I
found them.  Repeat, I found them.

EXT. HOTH - SNOWDRIFT - DAY

The small shelter Han set up is covered with snow on the windward side.
A makeshift antenna rests gingerly on top the snowdrift.  Han spots
Zev's snowspeeder approaching in the distance, and begins waving his
arms frantically at the tiny craft.

INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER

Strange robot surgeons adjust a mass of electronic equipment.  A switch
is thrown and a sudden blinding flash obscures Luke in a bacta tank
filled with a thick, gelatinous slime.  He begins to thrash about,
raving in delirium.

INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER - RECOVERY ROOM

Luke sits up in a recovery-room bed, weak but smiling.  His face shows
terrible wounds from the Wampa's attack.  Threepio and Artoo enter the
room.

THREEPIO
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

Artoo beeps his good wishes.

THREEPIO
Artoo expresses his relief, also.

Han and Chewie make their entrance.  The Wookiee growls a greeting.

HAN
How are you feeling, kid?  You
don't look so bad to me.  In
fact, you look strong enough to
pull the ears off a Gundark.

LUKE
Thanks to you.

HAN
That's two you owe me, junior.

Han turns as Leia enters the room.  He looks at her with a big,
devilish grin.

HAN
Well your Worship, looks like
you managed to keep me around for
a little while longer.

LEIA
(haughtily)
I had nothing to do with it.  General
Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for
any ships to leave the system until
we've activated the energy shield.

HAN
That's a good story.  I think you
just can't bear to let a gorgeous
guy like me out of your sight.

LEIA
I don't know where you get your
delusions, laser brain.

Chewie is amused; he laughs in his manner.  Han, enjoying himself,
regards Chewie good-humoredly.

HAN
Laugh it up, fuzzball.  But you
didn't see us alone in the south
passage.

Luke sparks to this; he looks at Leia.

HAN
She expressed her true feelings
for me.

Leia is flushed, eyes darting between Luke and Han.

LEIA
My...!  Why, you stuck up,... half-
witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf-
herder!

HAN
Who's scruffy-looking?
(to Luke)
I must have hit pretty close to
the mark to get her all riled up
like that, huh, kid?

Leia looks vulnerable for a moment, then the mask falls again, and she
focuses on Luke.

LEIA
Why, I guess you don't know
everything about women yet?

With that she leans over and kisses Luke on the lips.  Then she turns
on her heel and walks out, leaving everyone in the room slightly
dumbstruck.  With some smugness, Luke puts his hands behind his head
and grins.

Suddenly, in the distance, the muffled sound of an alarm is heard.

ANNOUNCER
(over loudspeaker)
Headquarters personnel, report to
command center.

The voice repeats the order and Han, Chewie, Artoo, and Threepio hurry
out of the room, bidding farewell to Luke.

HAN
Take it easy.

THREEPIO
Excuse us, please.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Rieekan looks up grimly from a console screen.  He calls over to Leia
and Han.

RIEEKAN
Princess... we have a visitor.

The group hurries over to Rieekan.

RIEEKAN
We've picked up something outside
the base in zone twelve, moving
east.

SENIOR CONTROLLER
It's metal.

LEIA
Then it couldn't be one of those
creatures that attacked Luke.

HAN
It could be a speeder, one of ours.

SENIOR CONTROLLER
No.  Wait - there's something very
weak coming through.

Threepio steps up to the control panel and listens intently to the
strange signal.

THREEPIO
Sir, I am fluent in six million
forms of communication.  This signal
is not used by the Alliance.  It
could be an Imperial code.

The transmission ends in static.

HAN
It isn't friendly, whatever it is.
Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.

RIEEKAN
Send Rogues Ten and Eleven to
station three-eight.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DAY

The dark probe robot moves past the smoldering ruins of station three-
eight and down a ridge toward the Rebel base.  It raises a large
antenna from the top of its head and begins to send out a piercing
signal.

The probe droid has spotted Chewbacca who, not thirty feet away, has
popped his head over a snow bank.  Instantly, the probe robot swings
around, its deadly ray ready to fire.  But before it can get a shot
off, it is hit from behind by a laser bolt, and explodes in a million
pieces.

Han Solo replaces his blaster in its holster and peers intently at the
smoldering remains of the Imperial probe.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Leia and Rieekan listen to Han on the comlink.

HAN
(over comlink)
Afraid there's not much left.

LEIA
(into comlink)
What was it?

HAN
(over comlink)
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit
it that hard.  It must have had a
self-destruct.

LEIA
(into comlink)
An Imperial probe droid.

HAN
(over comlink)
It's a good bet the Empire knows
we're here.

RIEEKAN
We'd better start the evacuation.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET

Darth Vader's Star Destroyer, larger and more awesome than the five
Imperial Star Destroyers that surround it, sits in the vastness of
space.  The six huge ships are surrounded by a convoy of smaller
spacecraft.  TIE fighters dart to and fro.

INT. DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - MAIN CONTROL DECK

Controllers working the vast complex of electronic controls hear
ominous approaching footsteps and look up from their controls.  The
squat, evil-looking Admiral Ozzel and the young, powerfully built
General Veers, who have been conferring near the front, also feel the
approaching presence and turn toward it.  Darth Vader, Lord of the
Sith, enters like a chill wind.  As Vader moves across the wide bridge,
Captain Piett hurries up to Ozzel.

PIETT
Admiral.

OZZEL
Yes, Captain

PIETT
I think we've got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment from
a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it's the best lead we've had.

OZZEL
(irritated)
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.  I want proof,
not leads!

PIETT
The visuals indicate life readings.

OZZEL
It could mean anything.  If we
followed every lead...

PIETT
But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed
to be devoid of human forms.

Vader moves to a large screen showing an image of the Rebel snow base.
Rebel speeders can be seen approaching the base in the distance.

VADER
You found something?

PIETT
Yes, my lord.

VADER
(studying the image
on the console screen)
That's it.  The Rebels are there.

OZZEL
My lord, there are so many uncharted
settlements.  It could be smugglers,
it could be...

VADER
That is the system.  And I'm sure
Skywalker is with them.  Set your
course for the Hoth system.  General
Veers, prepare you men.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - TRANSPORT BAY

A captain issues instructions to two of his men at the entrance to the
main transport bay.  Several Rebel transports behind them are being
loaded by men carrying heavy boxes and moving quickly, but not in
panic.

REBEL CAPTAIN
Groups seven and ten will stay
behind to fly the speeders.  As
soon as each transport is loaded,
evacuation control will give
clearance for immediate launch.

REBEL FIGHTER
Right, sir.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Alarms sound.  Troops, ground crews, and droids rush to their alert
stations.  Armored snowspeeders are lined up in attack formation near
the main entrance.

In the midst of all this activity, Han does some frantic welding on the
lifters of the Millennium Falcon.

Han finishes his work and hops down to the hangar floor.  He pulls out
his comlink, all the while eyeing problematic lifters.

HAN
(into comlink, to
Chewie)
Okay, that's it.  Try it... Off!
Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Off!

Smoke rises from a minor explosion on the lifter.  Exasperated, Han
surveys the new damage.

INT. REBEL BASE - MEDICAL CENTER

Luke dresses in readiness for the evacuation as his attending medical
droid stands by.

MEDICAL DROID
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-forty- sevens.

LUKE
Well, forget the heavy equipment.
There's plenty of time to get the
smaller modules on the transports.

MEDICAL DROID
Take care, sir.

LUKE
Thanks.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Pilots, gunners, and R2 units scurry about.  Luke, pulling on his
heavy-weather jacket, is headed toward a row of armored speeders.  He
stops at the rear of the Millennium Falcon, where Han and Chewie are
trying to repair the right lifter with even more haste than before.

LUKE
Chewie, take care of yourself,
okay?

As Luke pats Chewie on the arm, Chewie puts his arms around Luke and
gives him a tight hug.  Han is discussing the lifter with a repair
droid when he sees Luke.

HAN
Hi, kid.
(to droid)
There's got to be a reason for
it.  Check it at the other end.
Wait a second.
(to Luke)
You all right?

LUKE
Yeah.

HAN
Be careful.

LUKE
You, too.

Luke smiles, then waves at his friend and walks on.  After a few steps,
he stops and looks back.  Han glances up and the two exchange a silent
communication, each wishing the other safety, happiness - many things,
all difficult to verbalize.

INT. REBEL BASE - CONTROL ROOM.

Alarms sound throughout the hidden Rebel base.  In the control room, a
controller urgently gestures for General Rieekan to check a computer
scan.

CONTROLLER
General, there's a fleet of Star
Destroyers coming out of hyperspace
in sector four.

RIEEKAN
Reroute all power to the energy
shield.  We've got to hold them till
all transports are away.  Prepare
for ground assault.

Rieekan exits hurriedly.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER - MEDITATION CUBICLE

The dark cubicle is illuminated by a single shaft of light which falls
on the brooding Dark Lord as he sits on a raised meditation cube.
General Veers enters the room and approaches the silent, unmoving
Vader.  Although seemingly very sure of himself, Veers is still not
bold enough to interrupt the meditating lord.  The younger general
stands quietly at attention until the evil presence speaks.

VADER
What is it, General?

VEERS
My lord, the fleet has moves out
of light-speed.  Com-Scan has
detected an energy field protecting
an area around the sixth planet of
the Hoth system.  The field is
strong enough to deflect any
bombardment.

VADER
(angrily)
The Rebels are alerted to our
presence.  Admiral Ozzel came out
of light-speed too close to the
system.

VEERS
He felt surprise was wiser...

VADER
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.
General, prepare your troops for a
surface attack.

VEERS
Yes, my lord.

Veers turns smartly and leaves as Vader activates a large viewscreen
showing the bridge of his mighty ship.  Admiral Ozzel appears on the
viewscreen, standing slightly in front of Captain Piett.

OZZEL
Lord Vader, the fleet has moved
out of light-speed, and we're
preparing to... Aaagh!

VADER
You have failed me for the last
time, Admiral.  Captain Piett.

Piett steps forward, as the admiral moves away, slightly confused,
touching his throat as it begins to constrict painfully.

PIETT
Yes, my lord.

VADER
Make ready to land out troops beyond
the energy shield and deploy the
fleet so that nothing gets off that
system.  You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

PIETT
Thank you, Lord Vader.

Piett's pleasure about his unexpected promotion is not an unmixed
emotion.  He glances warily at the struggling Admiral Ozzel who, with a
final choke, stumbles and falls in a lifeless heap before him.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

With a sense of urgency, Leia quickly briefs a group of pilots gathered
in the center of the hangar.

LEIA
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.  The heavy
transport ships will leave as
soon as they're loaded.  Only two
fighter escorts per ship.  The
energy shield can only be opened
for a short time, so you'll have
to stay very close to your transports.

HOBBIE
Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?

LEIA
The ion cannon will fire several
shots to make sure that any enemy
ships will be out of your flight
path.  When you've gotten past the
energy shield, proceed directly to
the rendezvous point.  Understood?

PILOTS
(in unison)
Right.  Okay.

LEIA
Good luck.

DERLIN
Okay.  Everyone to your stations.
Let's go!

The pilots hurry away.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH - DAY

Rebel troops carry heavy bazooka-type weapons and position them along
the snow trench.  Men hurriedly respond to their officers' yelled
orders and brace themselves against the rhythmic gusts of bitter-cold
wind.

Other troops load power packs into a gun turret and swing its guns into
position.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - POWER GENERATORS

Near the base power generators, troops rush to set up their heavy
battle equipment.  Buzzing loudly, the generators send along, sparking
fingers of energy into the bitter Hoth wind.

INT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

The long line of Rebel controllers is tense, as are Princess Leia and
General Rieekan, who are trying very hard not to show any fear.

RIEEKAN
Their primary target will be the
power generators.  Prepare to
open the shield.

EXT. ICE PLAIN

The Rebel transport and two escort fighters begin their departure from
the ice planet.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER

A huge Imperial Star Destroyer rest against a sea of stars, far above
the white surface of the planet Hoth.

INT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

An Imperial controller approaches his commander.

CONTROLLER
Sir, Rebel ships are coming into
our sector.

CAPTAIN
Good.  Our first catch of the day.

INT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

WOMAN CONTROLLER
Stand by, ion control... Fire!

EXT. REBEL BASE ICE CAVE - ION CANNON

The giant ball-shaped ion cannon rotates into position and blasts two
red energy beams skyward.

EXT. SPACE - HOTH - REBEL TRANSPORT

The Rebel transport and its escort race away from the white planet,
closely followed by the two red energy beams.

As the Rebel transport races toward the waiting Imperial Star
Destroyer, it is overtaken by the two scarlet energy bolts.  The
Imperial Star Destroyer is hit in the conning tower by the powerful
bolts, which set up fiery explosions on its metal hull.

The big Star Destroyer veers, then spins wildly out of control.  As the
Imperial ship careers into deep space, the Rebel transport races away
to safety.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Pilots, gunners, and troopers hurry to their stations and their
vehicles.

ANNOUNCER
(over loudspeaker)
The first transport is away.

Everyone cheers at the announcement, which echoes through the hangar.
Luke turns and walks on, heading toward his snowspeeder.  His gunner,
Dack, a fresh-faced, eager kid, is glad to see him.  They climb in.

DACK
Feeling all right, sir?

LUKE
Just like new, Dack.  How about
you?

DACK
Right now I feel like I could take
on the whole Empire myself.

LUKE
(quietly, strapping
in)
I know what you mean.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN

A thin horizon line cuts across the bleak landscape.  Small dot-size
objects begin to appear on the horizon, moving in the direction of the
Rebel base.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH

A Rebel officer lifts a pair of electrobinoculars to his eyes.  Through
the lens he sees a very close view of a giant Imperial snow walker.  He
adjusts the view which then zooms back to reveal three more of the
ominous battle machines.  Small flashes of yellow fire billow from the
guns of the lumbering snow walkers.

The officer lowers his binoculars as the regular rhythmic pounding
begins to make the ground vibrate.  The pounding grows louder and is
accompanied by a high-pitched, metallic rattling.  The officer speaks
into his comlink.

TRENCH OFFICER
Echo Station Three-T-Eight.

INT. REBEL BASE - CORRIDOR

Pilots and gunners race to their waiting snowspeeders.  Ice and snow
begin falling from the walls of the corridor, shaken by the pounding
Imperial snow walker as they draw ever nearer.

TRENCH OFFICER
(over comlink)
We have spotted Imperial walkers!

CONTROLLER
Imperial walkers on the north
ridge.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH

The Rebel troops aim their weapons at the horizon as explosions erupt
all around them.  They are nervous and their grip on their weapons
tightens from the cold and from fear.

Behind the troops a dozen snowspeeders race through the sky.

INT. LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

LUKE
(into comlink)
Echo station Five-Seven.  We're
on our way.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

The fleet of snowspeeders races above the ice field at full throttle.
They accelerate away from the base and head toward the distant walkers.

INT. LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

LUKE
(into comlink)
All right, boys, keep tight now.

DACK
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

LUKE
Steady, Dack.  Attack pattern
delta.  Go now!

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

The cannons mounted on the walker head fire at the speeders.  Other
walkers loom in the background.  Two speeders race away past two of the
enormous walkers and bank to the right.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

LUKE
All right, I'm coming in.

He turns his speeder and heads directly at one of the walkers, flying
toward its towering legs.  The horizon twists as the speeder banks
between the legs.

LUKE
(into comlink)
Hobbie, you still with me?

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

Two speeders race directly at the head of a walker, then split and fly
past it.

Three other walkers march onward, firing all cannons.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOWTRENCH

Rebel troops fire on the approaching walkers, as the snow and ice
explode all around them.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

A speeder banks through and away from the legs of a walker.  Two other
speeders pass the first speeder from the opposite direction.  Other
Rebel craft race just above the icy plain.

A giant walker head swivels and fires, striking a snowspeeder and
sending it crashing in a ball of flames.

INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT

General Veers and two walker pilots keep a careful eye on the racing
Rebel snowspeeders as they maneuver their lumbering war machine
forward.

Luke's speeder banks in from the side of Veers's walker and heads
straight for its viewport, blasting away.  An explosion hits the walker
window, but dissipates, doing no harm.  The speeder roars up and over
the impregnable war machine.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

Luke looks back at the walker as it grows smaller in the distance.

LUKE
That armor's too strong for
blasters.

On the horizon, another walker moves up past Luke's cockpit window,
twisting out of sight as Luke banks and starts another run.

LUKE
(into comlink)
Rogue Group, use your harpoons
and tow cables.  Go for the legs.
It might be our only chance of
stopping them.
(to Dack)
All right, stand by, Dack.

Dack is at the gunner's controls.

DACK
Luke, we've got a malfunction in
fire control.  I'll have to cut in
the auxiliary.

LUKE
Just hang on.  Hang on, Dack.  Get
ready to fire that tow cable.

Barely keeping his seat in the tumbling ship, Dack struggles to set up
his harpoon gun.

Luke swings his speeder around and heads toward an oncoming walker.
Laser bolts and flak fill the air, creating a deadly obstacle course
for the tiny craft.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

Rogue Leader and another snowspeeder fly in tight formation toward the
walker as explosions burst all around them.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

After sustaining a heavy volley of fire, Luke turns around to see if
Dack is all right.

LUKE
Dack?  Dack!

Dack is lost.  Blood streams down his forehead, which rests on his
smoldering controls.  Out the back window, an Imperial walker recedes
in the distance.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH AREA

Rebel troops fire the dishlike ray gun while explosions erupt around
them.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - BATTLEFIELD

Two walkers lumber toward the Rebel base as a speeder between them
explodes in a ball of flames.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH

The dislike ray gun is hit by a laser bolt and instantly explodes.

INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT

Through the cockpit window, Veers and his pilot can see the Rebel power
generators in the distance.

A hologram of Darth Vader appears on a control panel screen.

VEERS
Yes, Lord Vader.  I've reached the
main power generator.  The shield
will be down in moments.  You may
start your landing.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

Wedge, I've lost my gunner.  You'll
have to make this shot.  I'll cover
for you.  Set your harpoon.  Follow
me on the next pass.

WEDGE
(into comlink)
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

LUKE

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

Wedge's speeder races through the legs of one of the monstrous walkers.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

WEDGE
(to gunner)
Activate harpoon.

Wedge's gunner reaches for a firing switch to activate the harpoon.
The harpoon flashes out, and speeds toward the receding legs of the
walker.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The harpoon hurtles toward the walker, In an instant it is embedded in
one of the walker's legs.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

WEDGE
(to gunner)
Good shot, Janson.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The speeder Rogue Three races around one of the giant walker's feet,
trailing the cable behind it.  Continuing around the back foot, Rogue
Three then circles the walker around the tail end.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

Wedge checks his controls and banks around the front of the walker.

WEDGE
One more pass.

JANSON
Coming around.  Once more.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The speeder sweeps left to right in front of the giant legs, towing the
cable behind it.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

JANSON
Once more.

Wedge swings the speeder between the legs of the giant walker.

JANSON
Cable out!  Let her go!

WEDGE
Detach cable.

EXT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE

The cable release on the back of the speeder snaps loose and the cable
drops away.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

JANSON
Cable detached.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The speeder zooms away into the distance.  The tangled legs of the
enormous war machine attempt a step, but as they do the giant Imperial
walker begins to topple.  It teeters for a moment, and then crashes
onto the icy ground, sending snow and metal pieces flying.

EXT. HOTH - ICE PLAIN - SNOW TRENCH

The troops in the trenches cheer at the sight of the crashing walker.

An officer gives a signal to his men and Rebel troops charge the fallen
war machine.

TRENCH OFFICER
Come on!

The troops run toward the downed walker, followed by two Rebel speeders
flying overhead.  Just as they reach the walker, it explodes, the
impact throwing some of the men onto the frozen ground.

INT. WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE THREE - COCKPIT

Wedge lets out a triumphant yell, banking his speeder away from the
fallen walker.

WEDGE
(into comlink)
Whooha!  That got him!

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

LUKE
(into comlink)
I see it, Wedge.  Good work.

INT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Large chunks of ice tumble into the command center as Leia and General
Rieekan monitor computer screens.

RIEEKAN
I don't think we can protect two
transports at a time.

LEIA
It's risky, but we can't hold out
much longer.  We have no choice.

RIEEKAN
(into comlink)
Launch patrols.

LEIA
(to an aide)
Evacuate remaining ground staff.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

Muffled distant explosions create widening cracks in the ice roof of
the hangar.  Trying to ignore the noise and falling bits of snow, Han
works on one of the Falcon's lifters while Chewie works on one of the
wings.  Noticing Chewie attach a wrong part, Han grows impatient.

HAN
No, no!  No!  This one goes there,
that one goes there.  Right?

In another area of the hangar, Threepio watches as Artoo is raised up
into Luke's X-wing fighter.

THREEPIO
Artoo, you take good care of
Master Luke now, understand?  And
... do take good care of yourself.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The fierce battle on the vast snow plains of Hoth rages on.  The
Imperial walkers continue their slow, steady assault on the Rebel base,
firing lasers as they lumber ever onward.  In the snow trench, Rebel
troops fire large bazookalike guns and dishlike ray guns as explosions
erupt around them.  A gun tower is hit by a laser bolt and instantly
explodes.  Another blast destroys a ray gun.

INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT

General Veers studies various readouts on his control panel.

VEERS
All troops will debark for ground
assault.  Prepare to target the
main generator.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

Luke's speeder and Rogue Two fly in formation, banking from right to
left and flying above the erupting battlefield.  Flak bursts all around
them.

INT.  LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

Luke, glancing over, sees Rogue Two on his left.  His ship shudders as
flak bursts nearby.

LUKE

LUKE
(over comlink)
Stay tight and low.

EXT. ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE TWO

Luke's speeder moves in formation with Rogue Two, when suddenly Zev's
speeder is hit by a laser bolt.  His ship bucks violently under the
impact and the cockpit explodes in a ball of flame.

Spewing smoke, the speeder hurtles toward a looming walker.  Before
they collide.  Rogue Two explodes in a million flaming pieces.

INT. LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROGUE LEADER - COCKPIT

Desperately, Luke works the controls of his flak-buffeted ship.
Suddenly, the speeder is rocked by a huge explosion.  Luke struggles
with the controls with a look of terror on his face.  The speeder fills
with smoke, and electrical sparks jump about the cockpit.

LUKE
(into comlink)
Hobbie, I've been hit!

INT. REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Apart from the distant thunder of laser blasts, the corridor is
strangely quiet and empty.  Running footsteps echo through the freezing
hallway, then Han appears.  Cracks have appeared in some of the walls
and some pipes have broken, sending hot steam billowing into the
underground hallways.  Han hurries into the command center.  It is a
shambles, but some people are still at their posts.  As he enters, a
gigantic cave-in almost obliterates the room.  He finds Leia and
Threepio near one of the control boards.

HAN
You all right?

Leia nods.  She is surprised to see him.

LEIA
Why are you still here?

HAN
I heard the command center had
been hit.

LEIA
You got your clearance to leave.

HAN
Don't worry.  I'll leave.  First
I'm going to get you to your ship.

THREEPIO
Your Highness, we must take this
last transport.  It's our only hope.

LEIA
(to controller)
Send all troops in sector twelve
to the south slope to protect the
fighters.

A blast rocks the command center, throwing Threepio backward into Han's
arms.

ANNOUNCER
(over loudspeaker)
Imperial troops have entered the
base.

HAN
Come on... that's it.

LEIA
(to head controller)
Give the evacuation code signal.
And get to your transports!

Leia looks exhausted.  Han grabs her and starts to lead her out.

As Han, Leia, and Threepio run out of the command center, the code
signal can be heard echoing off the corridor walls.

HEAD CONTROLLER
K-one-zero... all troops disengage.

THREEPIO
(to Han and Leia)
Oh!  Wait for me!

EXT. BATTLEFIELD - SNOW TRENCH

Rebel troops retreat under the awesome Imperial onslaught.

OFFICER
Begin retreat!

SECOND OFFICER
Fall back!

Troops flee from the battle, the ground exploding around them.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

Three of the giant walkers, firing lasers, advance toward the Rebel
headquarters.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW TRENCH

Continuing their retreat, the Rebels see the walkers looming ever
nearer.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD - ICE PLAIN

On the battlefield, Luke watches as a walker foot rises and moves over
him.  He looks up at the underbelly of the huge walker, passing
overhead.

Running beneath the monstrous machine, Luke fires his harpoon gun at
the walker's underside.  A thin cable follows the projectile from the
gun.  The magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull.

Still running under the walker, Luke attaches the cable drum to his
belt buckle.  Soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling
underneath the walker.

The walker's giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen
snow.  Stray laser bolts whistle by Luke as he climbs up the cable to
the walker's hull, reaching a small hatch.  Hanging precariously, Luke
cuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword.

He takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the
Imperial machine.  Quickly, Luke starts down the cable and crashes onto
the icy ground far below.  He lies unconscious as a giant rear leg
passes by - and just misses him.

The giant walker stops in mid-step.  A muffled explosion comes from
within - and then the walker's mechanical insides  are spewed out every
conceivable opening.  The machine sits dead in its tracks, smoking like
a locomotive on stilts.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

Veers's walker continues to advance toward the Rebel base.  The
smoldering walker that Luke exploded stands smoking just to the right
of Veers's path.

INT. IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT

Inside his walker, General Veers prepares to fire on the Rebel power
generators.

VEERS
Distance to power generators?

PILOT
One-seven, decimal two-eight.

Veers reaches for the electrorangefinder and lines up the main
generator.

VEERS
Target.  Maximum fire power.

EXT. HOTH - BATTLEFIELD

The Rebel troops continue their desperate retreat, pushed back by the
relentless Imperial assault.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDORS

With Threepio lagging behind, Han and Leia race through the crumbling
ice corridors.  Suddenly, there is an explosion.  Han turns, grabs the
princess, and pulls her to the wall as a tremendous cave-in blacks
their path.

He takes the comlink from his pocket.

HAN
(into comlink)
Transport, this is Solo.  Better
take off - I can't get to you.
I'll get the princess out on the
Falcon.

Han and Leia turn and race down the corridor.

THREEPIO
But... but... but... where are
you going?  Uh... come back!!

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

Imperial troops have reached the base.  As they push through the
blocked passageway, Darth Vader strides behind them.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR

Han and Leia run toward the entrance of the main hangar where the
Millennium Falcon is docked.  Threepio still lags behind.

THREEPIO
Wait!  Wait for me!  Wait!  Stop!

The door to the hangar closes in his face.

THREEPIO
(exasperated)
How typical.

Quickly, the door reopens as Han reaches out and pulls the golden droid
through.

HAN
Come on.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

Chewie paces under the shelter of the Millennium Falcon's landing gear.
The giant Wookiee pats the underbelly of his beloved ship and barks a
few reassuring words.  As he searches worriedly for his captain,
something at last catches his eye.

Chewie lets out a relieved shriek at seeing Han and Leia running toward
the ship.  The Wookiee runs out into the falling ice, lets out a howl,
then runs up the ship's ramp.  Han and Leia run up the ramp after him,
closely followed by Threepio.

HAN
Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're
going to be a permanent resident!

THREEPIO
Wait!  Wait!

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR

Imperial troops run through the base corridors.  Vader surveys the
place.  A huge chunk falls, almost hitting him, but  he calmly,
purposefully, continues around it.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGER - MILLENNIUM FALCON

A distant, huge, explosion rocks the hangar deck.  Ice cakes come
crashing down on the Millennium Falcon.

INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD

Han, standing before a control panel, is busy flipping switches as
Chewie watches a troublesome gauge.  A worried Leia observes their
efforts.

HAN
(to Chewie)
How's this?

The Wookiee barks a negative reply.

LEIA
Would it helped if I got out and
pushed?

HAN
It might.

Threepio clanks into the hold.

THREEPIO
Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir,
might I suggest that you...

Han gives the gold robot a devastating look.

THREEPIO
It can wait.

INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

They move to the cockpit where Han flips some more switches.  Leia
watches him, impatient, disbelieving.

LEIA
This bucket of bolts is never going
to get us past that blockade.

HAN
This baby's got a few surprises
left in her, sweetheart.

Han and Leia look out the cockpit window and see a squad of
stormtroopers rushing into the far side of the hangar.

Quickly, Han straps himself into the pilot's seat and Leia into the
navigator's chair.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

Stormtroopers hurriedly set up a large bazookalike weapon.  Behind them
the giant hangar doors open slowly.

EXT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON

A laser gun appears on the Falcon and swings around to aim at the
Imperial troops.

The stormtroopers, preparing to fire their bazooka cannon, are hit by
the Falcon's fire and are thrown about in all directions.

INT. MAIN HANGAR - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Chewie rushes into the cockpit.

HAN
Come on!  Come on!  Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

A laser hits the window near Chewie as he is settling into his chair.
Letting out a loud whelp, Chewie quickly pulls back on the controls and
the first stage of engine fire can be heard.  Han flashes a big grin at
Leia.

HAN
See?

LEIA
Someday you're going to be wrong,
and I hope I'm there to see it.

Han looks at Chewie.

HAN
Punch it!

The roar of the Falcon's main engines blasts out everything as the ice-
cave wall rushes by outside the cockpit window.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR

More stormtroopers run into the hangar, closely followed by Vader.
Hearing the loud roar of the Millennium Falcon's engines, Vader looks
toward the main hangar doors just in time to see the Falcon lift up and
disappear outside the cave.

EXT. HOTH - ICE SLOPE - DAY

Luke and two other pilots look up as the Millennium Falcon races above
them, flying very close to the ground.

The three pilots turn then, and trudge onward toward their X-wing
fighters, each going to his own ship.  Luke waves farewell, then heads
toward his own fighter.

Artoo, seated on his cubbyhole, chirps an excited greeting as Luke
climbs aboard the spacecraft.

LUKE
Artoo!  Get her ready for takeoff.

From his ship, Luke sees Wedge in his own X-wing, preparing for
takeoff.

WEDGE
Good luck, Luke.  See you at
the rendezvous.

Luke smiles and nods at Wedge, then lowers himself into the cockpit of
his X-wing while Artoo waits in the cubbyhole, beeping impatiently.

LUKE
Don't worry, Artoo.  We're going,
we're going.

The canopy over the X-wing lowers and snaps shut.

EXT. SPACE -  LUKE'S X-WING

Luke's fighter, its wings closed, speeds away from the icy planet.
Soon it disappears into the stars.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke, looking thoughtful, suddenly makes a decision.  He flips several
switches.  The stars shift as he takes his fighter into a steep turn.
The X-wing banks sharply and flies away in a new direction.

The monitor screen on Luke's control panel prints out a question from
the concerned Artoo.

LUKE
(into comlink)
There's nothing wrong, Artoo.
I'm just setting a new course.

Artoo beeps once again.

LUKE
(into comlink)
We're not going to regroup with
the others.

Artoo begins a protest, whistling an unbelieving, "What?!"

Luke reads Artoo's exclamation on his control panel.

LUKE
(into comlink)
We're going to the Dagobah system.

Luke checks his readouts and makes a few adjustments.  He rides along
with only the soft hum of the instruments to break the silence.
Finally, Artoo chirps up.

LUKE
(into comlink)
Yes, Artoo?

Artoo utters a soft, carefully phrased steam of whistles.

LUKE
(into comlink, chuckling)
That's all right.  I'd like to
keep it on manual control for a
while.

The little droid lets out a defeated whimper.  Luke smiles, and
continues on his course.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

The Millennium Falcon speeds away from Hoth, closely followed by one
huge Star Destroyer and four tiny TIE fighters.

As it is pursued, the Falcon races toward two very bright star-sized
objects.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Inside the cockpit, Chewie lets out a loud howl.  Han checks as the
ship is buffeted by exploding flak.  He appears to be doing six things
at once.

HAN
(harried)
I saw them!  I saw them!

LEIA
Saw what?

HAN
Star Destroyers, two of them,
coming right at us.

Threepio bumps and bangs his way into the cockpit.

THREEPIO
Sir, sir!  Might I suggest...

HAN
(to Leia)
Shut him up or shut him down!
(to Chewie)
Check the deflector shield!

Chewie barks a reply as he readjusts an overhead switch.

HAN
Oh, great.  Well, we can still
outmaneuver them.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYERS

The Millennium Falcon races toward one of the huge oncoming Star
Destroyers.  Suddenly, the Falcon starts into a deep dive straight
down, closely followed by four TIE fighters.  The underside of the Star
Destroyer continues on a collision course with two oncoming Star
Destroyers.  Slowly, it starts to veer to the left.

INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
Out the front window, the two approaching Star Destroyers can be seen
veering to the left.

IMPERIAL OFFICER
Take evasive action!

Alarms sound all over the huge ship.  The two other Star Destroyers get
closer, one of them moving over the bridge so close that it makes
brushing contact with it.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS

The Millennium Falcon races away from the colliding Star Destroyers,
still followed by four TIE fighters.  Laser bolts spark the pitch-black
skies.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Things have calmed down a bit, but the race isn't over yet.  Chewie
barks at Han.  Leia is still trying to recover from the steep dive.
The ship is buffeted by laser blasts.

HAN
Prepare to make the jump to light-
speed.

THREEPIO
But, sir!

The buffeting of lasers becomes louder and stronger.

LEIA
They're getting closer!

HAN
(with a gleam in his
eye)
Oh yeah?  Watch this.

Expectantly, they look out the cockpit window as stars do not go into
hyperspace, but just sit there.

Han and Chewie look at each other and are thrown into an acute state of
concern.

LEIA
Watch what?

Han tries again.  Still nothing.

HAN
I think we're in trouble.

THREEPIO
If I may say so, sir, I noticed
earlier that the hyperdrive
motivator has been damaged.  It's
impossible to go to light-speed!

HAN
We're in trouble!

The explosions become heavier.

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - STAR DESTROYER

The Falcon races into the starry vastness, followed by the four
Imperial TIE fighters and an Imperial Star Destroyer.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Stars race by as flak bursts outside the Falcon's window.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD

Han works furiously at some control panels while giving various orders
to Chewie.

HAN
Horizontal boosters...!
(Chewie barks)
Alluvial dampers...!  Well that's
not it.
(Chewie barks)
Bring me the hydrospanners!

Chewie hurries over to the pit and places the tools on the edge.

HAN
I don't know how we're going to
get out of this one.

Suddenly, a loud thump hits the side of the Falcon, causing it to lurch
radically.  Chewie barks.  The tools fall into the pit on top of Han.

HAN
Oww!  Chewie!

More turbulence rocks the ship.

HAN
That was no laser blast!  Something
hit us.

LEIA
(over comlink)
Han, get up here!

HAN
Come on, Chewie!

Han climbs out of the hold like a shot.  Both he and Chewie run out of
the hold and toward the cockpit.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Out the front cockpit window, they see hundreds of asteroids racing by.

LEIA
Asteroids!

Han changes places with Leia who has been at the controls, and Chewie
gets into his chair.  Han works his controls as a chunk of rock crosses
in front of the ship.

HAN
Oh, no!  Chewie, set two-seven-
one.

LEIA
What are you doing?  You're not
actually going into an asteroid
field?

HAN
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

Another asteroid thumps against the ship and Leia winces at the jolt.

LEIA
You don't have to do this to
impress me.

THREEPIO
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field is
approximately three thousand, seven
hundred and twenty to one.

HAN
Never tell me the odds!

EXT. ASTEROID BELT - MILLENNIUM FALCON

The Falcon turns into the asteroid storm and as the ship completes its
turn, asteroids start coming straight at the cockpit windows.

A large asteroid tumbles away from the Falcon's path at top speed.
Several smaller asteroids crash into the big one, creating small
explosions on its surface.  Other asteroids of all sizes pass by in
every direction, some colliding and exploding.  The tiny Millennium
Falcon veers around the big asteroid and races past it through the rain
of rocks, followed by four TIE fighters, which bob and weave around the
asteroids.

One of the pursuing TIE fighters connects with an asteroid and
explodes.  The other fighters are pelted with a steady stream of
smaller explosions.

Two huge asteroids tumble toward the Millennium Falcon, which quickly
banks around both of them.  The three TIE fighters follow in hot
pursuit until one of the fighters scrapes an asteroid and tumbles out
of control into deep space.

EXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYER - ASTEROID BELT

The massive Star Destroyer blasts oncoming asteroids as it follows the
Falcon.  Smaller asteroids explode across its vast surface.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - TIE FIGHTERS - ASTEROID BELT

The Falcon twists on its side as it races around an oncoming asteroid.
Two TIE fighters follow in the distance, coming from either side.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Asteroids race by the cockpit window as Han pilots his trusty craft
through the dangerous field.

Looking out the cockpit window, the Falcon crew sees a big asteroid
drop past the window, narrowly missing their ship.

Chewie barks in terror as a slightly smaller asteroid comes especially
close - to close - and bounces off the Falcon with a loud crunch.
Threepio's hands cover his eyes.  He manages a short peek at the
cockpit window.  Princess Leia sits stone-faced, staring at the action.
Han gives her a quick look.

HAN
You said you wanted to be around
when I made a mistake; well, this
could be it, sweetheart.

LEIA
I take it back.  We're going to
get pulverized if we stay out here
much longer.

The group watches as more asteroids race by outside the window.

HAN
I'm not going to argue with that.

THREEPIO
Pulverized?

HAN
I'm going in closer to one of
those big ones.

LEIA
Closer?

THREEPIO
Closer?!

Chewbacca barks the same word, only louder.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID BELT

The Millennium Falcon dives toward the surface of one of the moon-sized
asteroids.  There is a continued display of explosions against the
starry void as smaller asteroids collide with larger chunks of rock.
The two remaining TIE fighters follow the Falcon to the large asteroid.
The Falcon skims the surface of the giant asteroid as, all the while,
small asteroids explode on the surface of the ship.

The TIE fighters approach the Falcon, but a giant asteroid hurtles
directly into their path.  As the asteroid continues on its way, it
leaves remains of the two exploded TIE fighters to tumble into deep
space.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Rattled by the violent rocking of the starship, Threepio is nearly in
hysterics.

THREEPIO
Oh, this is suicide!

Han notices something on his main scope and nudges his faithful
Wookiee, pointing.

HAN
There.  That looks pretty good.

LEIA
What looks pretty good?

HAN
Yeah.  That'll do nicely.

THREEPIO
(to Leia)
Excuse me, ma'am, but where are
we going?

Out the cockpit window, they see that they are skimming the surface of
the enormous asteroid and nearing a large crater.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID CRATER

The Millennium Falcon dives into the huge crater and disappears.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

LEIA
I hope you know what you're doing.

HAN
Yeah, me too.

INT. GIANT ASTEROID CRATER

The Falcon races down into the crater.  The walls are barely visible as
the ship speed through the tunnellike opening.  A small cave appears on
one side of the crater, and the Falcon turns, slows, and scoots into
it.

EXT. SPACE -  LUKE'S X-WING

The tiny X-wing speeds toward the cloud cover of Dagobah.  Artoo,
riding on the back of the fighter, turns his head back and forth with
some anxiety.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke watches Artoo's words as they are translated and screened on the
computer scope.

LUKE
(into comlink)
Yes, that's it.  Dagobah.

Artoo beeps a hopeful inquiry.

LUKE
(into comlink)
No, I'm not going to change my
mind about this.
(getting a little nervous)
I'm not picking up any cities or
technology.  Massive life-form
readings, though.  There's something
alive down there...

Artoo beeps, this time a slightly worried question.

LUKE
(into comlink)
Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe
for droids.

EXT. SPACE - DAGOBAH -  LUKE'S X-WING

The X-wing continues its flight through the twilight above the cloud-
covered planet.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke sees the cloud race by as he takes his craft closer to the planet.
He must operate his controls carefully since the cloud cover has
completely obscured his vision.  An alarm buzzes in the background,
Artoo beeps and whistles frantically.

LUKE
(into comlink)
I know, I know!  All the scopes are
dead.  I can't see a thing!  Just
hang on, I'm going to start the
landing cycle...

The blast of the retrorockets is deafening, drowning out Artoo's
electronic squeals.  Suddenly, there is a cracking sound as if limbs
were being broken off trees and then a tremendous jolt as the
spacecraft stops.  Luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open.

EXT. DAGOBAH - DUSK

The mist-shrouded X-wing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog.
Luke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as Artoo pops out
of his cubbyhole on the back.  The young warrior surveys the fog, which
is barely pierced by the ship's landing lights.  About all he can make
out are some giant, twisted trees nearby.  Artoo whistles anxiously.

LUKE
No, Artoo, you stay put.  I'll
have a look around.

Artoo lets out a short beep.  As Luke moves along the nose, Artoo loses
his balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake.

LUKE
Artoo?

Luke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo, but the water
is still and reveals no sign of the little droid.

LUKE
Artoo!  Where are you?

A small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is
heard.  The periscope starts to move to shore.  Relieved, Luke starts
running along the nose of the fighter to its tip.

LUKE
Artoo!  You be more careful.

The outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away.

Luke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the shore, and
turns to look for Artoo.  The periscope still steadily moves toward
shore.

LUKE
Artoo - that way!

Suddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape appears, moving
toward the little droid.  The dark, sinuous bog beast dives beneath the
swampy water, making a loud clunk against Artoo's metal hull.  The
droid disappears from sight, uttering a pathetic electronic scream.

Holding his ignited lightsaber before him, Luke wades a few feet into
the murky pool, looking for any sign of his little friend.

LUKE
Artoo!

The black surface is still as death itself... until a few bubbles begin
to appear.  Then, phheewaat!! The runt-size robot is spit out of the
water, makes a graceful arc, and comes crashing down into a patch of
soft gray moss.

LUKE
Oh, no!  Are you all right?  Come
on.  You're lucky you don't taste
very good.  Anything broken?

Luke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from
his round metal body.  Artoo responds with feeble, soggy beeps.

LUKE
If you're saying coming here was
a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree
with you.  Oh, Artoo, what are we
doing here?  It's like... something
out of a dream, or, I don't know.
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

As Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him,
Artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports.

EXT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER

Admiral Piett hesitates in the entryway to Vader's private cubicle.

After a moment, he steps into the room and pauses at the surprising
sight before him.

Darth Vader, his back turned, is silhouetted in the gloom on the far
side of the chamber.  A black, insectlike droid attends him.  Among the
various apparatuses surrounding them, a respirator tube now retracts
from Vader's uncovered head.  The head is bald with a mass of ugly scar
tissue covering it.  The black droid then lowers the mask and helmet
onto Vader's head.  When it is in place, the Dark Lord turns to face
Piett.

VADER
Yes, Admiral?

PIETT
Our ships have sighted the
Millennium Falcon, lord.  But...
it has entered an asteroid field
and we cannot risk...

VADER
(interrupting)
Asteroids do not concern me,
Admiral.  I want that ship and
not excuses.

PIETT
Yes, lord.

EXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

The pirate starship rests in a dark, dripping asteroid cave.  It is so
dark that the cave's exact dimensions are impossible to determine.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han and Chewie busily shut down the engine and all electronic systems.
Threepio and Leia watch worriedly.

HAN
I'm going to shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

THREEPIO
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask,
but... does that include shutting
me down, too?

Chewie barks "yes".  But Han thinks otherwise.

HAN
No, I need you to talk to the
Falcon, find out what's wrong with
the hyperdrive.

Suddenly, the ship lurches, causing all the loose items in the cockpit
to go flying.  Chewie howls.

THREEPIO
Sir, it's quite possible this
asteroid is not entirely stable.

HAN
Not entirely stable?  I'm glad you're
here to tell us these things.  Chewie,
take the professor in the back and
plug him into the hyperdrive.

THREEPIO
Oh!  Sometimes I just don't
understand human behavior.  After
all, I'm only trying to do my job
in the most...

The sliding door closes behind the indignant Threepio as Chewie and he
move back to the hold.  Suddenly, the ship lurches again, throwing Leia
across the cabin into Han's arms.  Then, abruptly, the motion stops as
suddenly as it started.  With some surprise, Han and Leia realize they
are in each other's arms.

LEIA
Let go.

HAN
Sshh!

LEIA
Let go, please.

Leia flushes, averting her eyes.  She's not exactly fighting to get
free.  But, of course, Han blows it...

HAN
Don't get excited.

The anger rises in Leia.

LEIA
Captain, being held by you isn't
quite enough to get me excited.

HAN
Sorry, sweetheart.  We haven't
got time for anything else.

Han grins quickly wickedly at Leia as he turns and exits through the
door.  Leia's confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG CLEARING - DUSK

The mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very gloomy-looking
swamp.

Luke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing.  He ignites
a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it.  Taking a power
cable, he plugs it into Artoo's noselike socket.

LUKE
Ready for some power?  Okay.
Let's see now.  Put that in
there.  There you go.

The droid whistles his appreciation.  Luke then opens a container of
processed food and sits before the thermal heater.

LUKE
(sighs)
Now all I have to do is find this
Yoda... if he even exists.

Nervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle.

LUKE
Still... there's something familiar
about this place.  I feel like...
I don't know...

STRANGE VOICE
Feel like what?

Luke jumps out of his skin.  Artoo screeches in terror.  The young
warrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around, looking for the
speaker.  Mysteriously standing right in front of Luke is a strange,
bluish creature, not more than two feet tall.  The wizened little thing
is dressed in rags.  It motions toward Luke's sword.

LUKE
(looking at the
creature)
Like we're being watched!

CREATURE
Away with your weapon!  I mean
you no harm.

After some hesitation, Luke puts away his weapon, although he really
doesn't understand why.  Artoo watches with interest.

CREATURE
I am wondering, why are you here?

LUKE
I'm looking for someone.

CREATURE
Looking?  Found someone, you have,
I would say, hmmm?

The little creature laughs.

LUKE
(Trying to keep from
smiling)
Right.

CREATURE
Help you I can.  Yes, mmmm.

LUKE
I don't think so.  I'm looking
for a great warrior.

CREATURE
Ahhh!  A great warrior.
(laughs and shakes
his head)
Wars not make one great.

With the aid of a walking stick, the tiny stranger moves over to one of
the cases of supplies.  He begins to rummage around.

Artoo moves to the edge of the case - standing almost eye level to the
creature who is carelessly handling the supplies - and squeaks his
disapproval.

Their tiny visitor pick up the container of food Luke was eating from
and takes a bite.

LUKE
Put that down.  Hey!  That's my
dinner!

The creature spits out the bite he has taken.  He makes a face.

CREATURE
How you get so big, eating food
of this kind?

He flips the container in Luke's direction and reaches into one of
Luke's supply cases.

LUKE
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to
land in that puddle, and if we
could get our ship out, we would,
but we can't, so why don't you just...

CREATURE
(teasing)
Aww, cannot get your ship out?

The creature spots something of interest in Luke's case.  Luke loses
patience and grabs the case away.  The creature retains his prize - a
tiny power lamp - and examines it with delight.

LUKE
Hey, you could have broken this.
Don't do that.  Ohhh... you're
making a mess.  Hey, give me that!

CREATURE
(retreating with
the lamp)
Mine!  Or I will help you not.

Clutching its treasure, the creature backs away from Luke, drawing
closer to Artoo.  As Luke and the creature argue, one of Artoo's little
arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp, completely unnoticed by
the creature.

LUKE
I don't want your help.  I want
my lamp back.  I'll need it to
get out of this slimy mudhole.

CREATURE
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.

Artoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately
engaged in a tug-of-war over it.

Artoo beeps a few angry, "Give me thats."

CREATURE
Ah, ah, ah!

LUKE
Oh, Artoo, let him have it!

CREATURE
Mine!  Mine!

LUKE
Artoo!

CREATURE
Mine!

The creature lets go with one hand and pokes Artoo lightly with one
finger.  Artoo reacts with a startled squeal, and lets go.

CREATURE
Mine!

LUKE
(fed up)
Now will you move along, little
fella?  We're got a lot of work
to do.

CREATURE
No!  No, no!  Stay and help you,
I will.
(laughs)
Find your friend, hmm?

LUKE
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi Master.

CREATURE
Oohhh.  Jedi Master.  Yoda.  You
seek Yoda.

LUKE
You know him?

CREATURE
Mmm.  Take you to him, I will.
(laughs)
Yes, yes.  But now, we must eat.
Come.  Good food.  Come.

With that, the creature scurries out of the clearing, laughing merrily.
Luke stares after him.  All he sees is the faint light from the small
power lamp moving through the fog.  Luke makes his decision and starts
after the creature.

CREATURE
(in the distance)
Come, come.

Artoo, very upset, whistles a blue streak of protest.

LUKE
Stay here and watch after the
camp, Artoo.

Artoo beeps even more frantically.  But as Luke disappears from view,
the worried little droid grows quieter, and utters a soft electronic
sigh.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - MAIN HOLD AREA

Threepio whistles and beeps a strange dialect into the control panel in
front of him.  The control panel whistles back a few mystifying beeps.

THREEPIO
Oh, where is Artoo when I need
him?

Han enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box.

THREEPIO
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate, but it
has the most peculiar dialect.  I
believe, sir, it says that the
power coupling on the negative
axis has been polarized.  I'm
afraid you'll have to replace it.

HAN
Well, of course I'll have to replace
it.

He hands a wire coil up to Chewie who is working near the ceiling.

HAN
Here!  And Chewie...

Chewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and
whines.  Han glances back at Threepio, then speaks quietly to Chewie so
only he can hear.

HAN
(continuing)
... I think we'd better replace
the negative power coupling.

Leia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts
to reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve.  It
doesn't budge.  Han notices her struggle, and moves to help her.  She
rebuffs him.

HAN
Hey, Your Worship, I'm only
trying to help.

LEIA
(still struggling)
Would you please stop calling me
that?

Han hears a new tone in her voice.  He watches her pull on the lever.

HAN
Sure, Leia.

LEIA
Oh, you make it so difficult
sometimes.

HAN
I do, I really do.  You could be
a little nicer, though.
(he watches her
reaction)
Come on, admit it.  Sometimes you
think I'm all right.

She lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand.

LEIA
Occasionally...
(a little smile,
haltingly)
... when you aren't acting like
a scoundrel.

HAN
(laughs)
Scoundrel?  Scoundrel?  I like
the sound of that.

With that, Han takes her hand and starts to massage it.

LEIA
Stop that.

HAN
Stop what?

Leia is flushes, confused.

LEIA
Stop that!  My hands are dirty.

HAN
My hands are dirty, too.  What
are you afraid of?

LEIA
(looking right
into his eyes)
Afraid?

Han looks at her with a piercing look.  He's never looked more
handsome, more dashing, more confident.  He reaches out slowly and
takes Leia's hand again from where it is resting on a console.  He
draws it toward him.

HAN
You're trembling.

LEIA
I'm not trembling.

Then with an irresistible combination of physical strength and
emotional power, the space pirate begins to draw Leia toward him...
very slowly.

HAN
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
There aren't enough scoundrels in
your life.

Leia is now very close to Han and as she speaks, her voice becomes an
excited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words.

LEIA
I happen to like nice men.

HAN
I'm a nice man.

LEIA
No, you're not.  You're...

He kisses her now, with slow, hot lips.  He takes his time, as though
he had forever, bending her body backward.  She has never been kissed
like this before, and it almost makes her faint.  When he stops, she
regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it
hard to talk.

Suddenly, Threepio appears in the doorway, speaking excitedly.

THREEPIO
Sir, sir!  I've isolated the
reverse power flux coupling.

Han turns slowly, icily, from their embrace.

HAN
Thank you.  Thank you very much.

THREEPIO
Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

The moment spoiled, Han marches out after Threepio.

EXT. SPACE - ASTEROID FIELD

The Imperial fleet moves through the asteroid-filled void, intently
seeking its prey.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Asteroids collide, creating a fireworks display outside the bridge
window.  Darth Vader stands, staring out the window above the control
deck.  Then slowly turns toward the bridge.  Before him are the
hologram images of twenty battleship commanders.  One of these images,
the commander of a ship that has just exploded, is fading away quickly.
Another image, in the center and a little apart from the others, is
faded and continually disrupted by static.  It is the image of Captain
Needa, commander of the Star Destroyer most hotly on the tail of the
Millennium Falcon.  Admiral Piett and an aide stand behind the Dark
Lord.

NEEDA
(in hologram)
... and that, Lord Vader, was the
last time they appeared in any of
our scopes.  Considering the amount
of damage we've sustained, they
must have been destroyed.

VADER
No, Captain, they're alive.  I
want every ship available to
sweep the asteroid field until
they are found.

The Imperial star captains fade out one by one as Vader turns to
Admiral Piett.

PIETT
Lord Vader.

VADER
Yes, Admiral, what is it?

The admiral is scared, his face white as a sheet.

PIETT
The Emperor commands you make
contact with him.

VADER
Move the ship out of the asteroid
field so that we can send a clear
transmission.

PIETT
Yes, my lord.

EXT. ASTEROID FIELD - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER

Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves against the vast sea of stars
away from the rest of the fleet.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - VADER'S CHAMBER

The Dark Lord, Darth Vader, is alone in his chamber.  A strange sound
enters the room and a light begins to play across Vader's black figure.
He looks up and bows quickly.

A twelve-foot hologram of the Galactic Emperor materializes before
Vader.  The Emperor's dark robes and monk's hood are reminiscent of the
cloak worn by Ben Kenobi.  His voice is even deeper and more
frightening than Vader's.

VADER
What is thy bidding, my master?

EMPEROR
There is a great disturbance in
the Force.

VADER
I have felt it.

EMPEROR
We have a new enemy - Luke
Skywalker.

VADER
Yes, my master.

EMPEROR
He could destroy us.

VADER
He's just a boy.  Obi-Wan can no
longer help him.

EMPEROR
The Force is strong with him.  The
son of Skywalker must not become a
Jedi.

VADER
If he could be turned, he would
become a powerful ally.

EMPEROR
Yes.  Yes.  He would be a great
asset.  Can it be done?

VADER
He will join us or die, my
master.

Vader kneels.  The supreme Emperor passes a hand over the crouched Lord
of the Sith and fades away.

EXT. DAGOBAH - CREATURE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A heavy downpour of rain pounds through the gnarled trees.  A strange
baroque mud house sits on a moss-covered knoll on the edge of a small
lagoon.  The small, gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its
thick glass windows.  As rain tap-dances a merry tune on Artoo's head,
the stubby little droid rises up on his tip-toes to peek into one of
the glowing portals.

INT. CREATURE'S HOUSE

Artoo, peeking in the window, sees the inside of the house - a very
plain, but cozy dwelling.  Everything is in the same small scale as the
creature.  The only thing out of place in the miniature room is Luke,
whose height makes the four-foot ceiling seem even lower.  He sits
cross-legged on the floor of the living room.

The creature is in an adjoining area - his little kitchen - cooking up
an incredible meal.  The stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and
pans.  The wizened little host scurries about chopping this, shredding
that, and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices.  He rushes
back and forth putting platters on the table in front of Luke, who
watches the creature impatiently.

LUKE
Look, I'm sure it's delicious.
I just don't understand why we
can't see Yoda now.

CREATURE
Patience!  For the Jedi it is
time to eat as well.  Eat, eat.
Hot.  Good food, hm? Good, hmm?

Moving with some difficulty in the cramped quarters, Luke sits down
near the fire and serves himself from the pot.  Tasting the unfamiliar
concoction, he is pleasantly surprised.

LUKE
How far away is Yoda?  Will it
take us long to get there?

CREATURE
Not far.  Yoda not far.  Patience.
Soon you will be with him.
(tasting food from
the pot)
Rootleaf, I cook.  Why wish you
become Jedi?  Hm?

LUKE
Mostly because of my father, I
guess.

CREATURE
Ah, your father.  Powerful Jedi
was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.

LUKE
(a little angry)
Oh, come on.  How could you know
my father?  You don't even know
who I am.
(fed up)
Oh, I don't know what I'm doing
here.  We're wasting our time.

The creature turns away from Luke and speaks to a third party.

CREATURE
(irritated)
I cannot teach him.  The boy has
no patience.

Luke's head spins in the direction the creature faces.  But there is no
one there.  The boy is bewildered, but it gradually dawns on him that
the little creature is Yoda, the Jedi Master, and that he is speaking
with Ben.

BEN'S VOICE
He will learn patience.

YODA
Hmmm.  Much anger in him, like his father.

BEN'S VOICE
Was I any different when you
taught me?

YODA
Hah.  He is not ready.

LUKE
Yoda!  I am ready.  I... Ben!  I
can be a Jedi.  Ben, tell him I'm
ready.

Trying to see Ben, Luke starts to get up but hits his head on the low
ceiling.

YODA
Ready, are you?  What know you
of ready?  For eight hundred years
have I trained Jedi.  My own counsel
will I keep on who is to be trained!
A Jedi must have the deepest
commitment, the most serious mind.
(to the invisible
Ben, indicating Luke)
This one a long time have I watched.
All his life has he looked away...
to the future, to the horizon.
Never his mind on where he was.
Hmm?  What he was doing.  Hmph.
Adventure.  Heh!  Excitement.  Heh!
A Jedi craves not these things.
(turning to Luke)
You are reckless!

Luke looks down.  He knows it is true.

BEN'S VOICE
So was I, if you'll remember.

YODA
He is too old.  Yes, too old to
begin the training.

Luke thinks he detects a subtle softening in Yoda's voice.

LUKE
But I've learned so much.

Yoda turns his piercing gaze on Luke, as though the Jedi Master's huge
eyes could somehow determine how much the boy had learned.  After a
long moment, the little Jedi turns toward where he alone sees Ben.

YODA
(sighs)
Will he finished what he begins?

LUKE
I won't fail you - I'm not afraid.

YODA
(turns slowly toward
him)
Oh, you will be.  You will be.

EXT. SPACE - STAR DESTROYERS - ASTEROID FIELD

The Imperial fleet around Vader's ship is surrounded by the asteroid
storm.  Asteroids big and small pelt the vast exteriors of the menacing
ships.  One of the smaller Imperial vessels is hit by a huge asteroid
and explodes in a brilliant flash of light.

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

The cockpit is quiet and lit only by the indicator lights on the
control panel.  Princess Leia sits in the pilot's seat.

She runs her hand across the control panel as she thinks of Han and the
confusion he has created within her.  Suddenly, something outside the
cockpit window catches her eye.  The reflection of the panel lights
obscures her vision until a soft suctionlike cup attaches itself to the
windscreen.  Leia
moves closer to see what it might be.  Large, yellow eyes flash open
and stare back at her.  Startled, she jumps back into her seat, her
heart pounding.  There is a scurry of feet and a loud screech, and in
an instant the eyes are gone.  The young princess catches her breath,
jumps out of her chair, and races from the cockpit.

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD AREA

The lights go bright for a second then out again.  Threepio and
Chewbacca watch as Han finishes with some wires.

THREEPIO
Sir, if I may venture an opinion...

HAN
I'm not really interested in your
opinion, Threepio.

Leia rushes into the cabin just as Han drops the final floor panel into
place.

LEIA
(out of breath)
There's something out there.

HAN
Where?

LEIA
Outside, in the cave.

As she speaks, there comes a sharp banging on the hull.  Chewie looks
up and barks anxiously.

THREEPIO
There it is.  Listen!  Listen!

HAN
I'm going out there.

LEIA
Are you crazy?!

HAN
I just got this bucket back
together.  I'm not going to let
something tear it apart.

He and Chewie grab their breath masks off a rack and hurry out.  Leia
follows.

LEIA
Then I'm going with you.

THREEPIO
I think it might be better if I
stay here and guard the ship.
(hears another
mysterious noise)
Oh, no.

EXT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

It is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave, too dark to see what is
attacking the ship.

Leia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave.

LEIA
This ground sure feels strange.
It doesn't feel like rock at all.

Han kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to study the outline
of the cave.

HAN
There's an awful lot of moisture
in here.

LEIA
I don't know.  I have a bad feeling
about this.

HAN
Yeah.

Chewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the ship's
cockpit.  A five-foot-long shape can be seen moving across the top of
the Falcon.  The leathery creature lets out a screech as Han blasts it
with a laser bolt.

HAN
(to Leia)
Watch out!

The black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front
of the princess.  Han bends down to investigate the dead creature.

HAN
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Mynock.  Chewie, check the rest
of the ship, make sure there
aren't any more attached.  They're
chewing on the power cables.

LEIA
Mynocks?

HAN
Go on inside.  We'll clean them
off if there are any more.

Just then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air.  Leia
puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the
ship.  Chewie shoos another Mynock away with his blaster.  Several of
the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit
window of the Falcon.  Inside, Threepio shudders at their presence.

THREEPIO
Ohhh!  Go away!  Go away!  Beastly
little thing.  Shoo!  Shoo!

Han looks around the strange, dripping cave.

HAN
Wait a minute...

He unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave.
The cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle.

Chewie barks and moves for the ship, followed closely by Leia and Han.
The large wings of the Mynocks flap past them as they protect their
faces and run up the platform.

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ENTRY AREA

As soon as Han and Leia are on board, Chewie closes the main hatch.
The ship continues to shake and heave.

HAN
All right, Chewie, let's get
out of here!

The Wookiee heads for the cockpit as Han, followed by Threepio, rushes
to the hold area and checks the scopes on the control panel.  Leia
hurries after.

LEIA
The Empire is still out there.
I don't think it's wise to...

Han rushes past her and heads for the cockpit.

HAN
(interrupting)
No time to discuss this in
committee.

And with that he is gone.  The main engines of the Falcon begin to
whine.  Leia races after him, bouncing around in the shaking ship.

LEIA
(angry)
I am not a committee!

INT. ASTEROID CAVE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han is already in the pilot's seat pulling back on the throttle.  The
cave-quake has greatly diminished.

LEIA
You can't make the jump to light-
speed in this asteroid field...

HAN
Sit down, sweetheart.  We're
taking off!

As the ship begins to move forward, Chewie barks.  He notices something
out the window ahead.  Threepio sees it too.

THREEPIO
Look!

HAN
I see it, I see it.

Suddenly, a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen
surrounding the entrance.  And as the Falcon moves forward, the
entrance to the cave grows ever smaller.  Han pulls hard on the
throttle, sending his ship surging forward.

THREEPIO
We're doomed!

LEIA
The cave is collapsing.

HAN
This is no cave.

LEIA
What?

Leia's mouth drops open .  She sees that the rocks of the cave entrance
are not rocks at all, but giant teeth, quickly closing around the tiny
ship.  Chewie howls.

INT. SPACE SLUG MOUTH

The Millennium Falcon, zooming through the monster's mouth, rolls on
its side and barely makes it between two of the gigantic white teeth
before the huge jaws slams closed.

EXT. CAVE ENTRANCE - GIANT ASTEROID

The enormous space slug moves its head out of the cave as the Falcon
flies out of its mouth.  The monster tilts its head, watching the
starship fly away.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GIANT ASTEROID

The Falcon races out of the asteroid crater and into the deadly rain of
the asteroid storm.

EXT. DAGOBAH - DAY

With Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of the many thick
vines that grow in the swamp.  Panting heavily, he continues his course
- climbing, flipping through the air, jumping over roots, and racing in
and out of the heavy ground fog.

YODA
Run!  Yes.  A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.  But beware
of the dark side.  Anger... fear...
aggression.  The dark side of
the Force are they.
Easily they flow, quick to join
you in a fight.  If once you
start down the dark path, forever
will it dominate your destiny,
consume you it will, as it did
Obi-Wan's apprentice.

LUKE
Vader.  Is the dark side stronger?

YODA
No... no... no.  Quicker, easier,
more seductive.

LUKE
But how am I to know the good side
from the bad?

YODA
You will know.  When you are calm,
at peace.  Passive.  A Jedi uses
the Force for knowledge and
defense, never for attack.

LUKE
But tell me why I can't...

YODA
(interrupting)
No, no, there is no why.  Nothing
more will I teach you today.
Clear your mind of questions.
Mmm.  Mmmmmmmm.

Artoo beeps in the distance as Luke lets Yoda down to the ground.
Breathing heavily, he takes his shirt from a nearby tree branch and
pulls it on.

He turns to see a huge, dead, black tree, its base surrounded by a few
feet of water.  Giant, twisted roots form a dark and sinister cave on
one side.  Luke stares at the tree, trembling.

LUKE
There's something not right here.

Yoda sits on a large root, poking his Gimer Stick into the dirt.

LUKE
I feel cold, death.

YODA
That place... is strong with the
dark side of the Force.  A domain
of evil it is.  In you must go.

LUKE
What's in there?

YODA
Only what you take with you.

Luke looks warily between the tree and Yoda.  He starts to strap on his
weapon belt.

YODA
Your weapons... you will not
need them.

Luke gives the tree a long look, than shakes his head "no."  Yoda
shrugs.  Luke reaches up to brush aside some hanging vines and enters
the tree.

INT. DAGOBAH - TREE CAVE

Luke moves into the almost total darkness of the wet and slimy cave.
The youth can barely make out the edge of the passage.  Holding his lit
saber before him, he sees a lizard crawling up the side of the cave and
a snake wrapped around the branches of a tree.  Luke draws a deep
breath, then pushes deeper into the cave.

The space widens around him, but he feels that rather than sees it.
His sword casts the only light as he peers into the darkness.  It is
very quiet here.

Then, a loud HISS! Darth Vader appears across the blackness,
illuminated by his own just-ignited laser sword.  Immediately, he
charges Luke, saber held high.  He is upon the youth in seconds, but
Luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at Vader with his sword.

Vader is decapitated.  His helmet-encased head flies from his shoulders
as his body disappears into the darkness.  The metallic banging of the
helmet fills the cave as Vader's head spins and bounces, smashes on the
floor, and finally stops. For an instant it rests on the floor, then it
cracks vertically.  The black helmet and breath mask fall away to
reveal... Luke's head.

Across the space, the standing Luke gasps at the sight, wide-eyed in
terror.

The decapitated head fades away, as in a vision.

EXT. DAGOBAH - CAVE - DUSK

Meanwhile, Yoda sits on the root, calmly leaning on his Gimer Stick.

EXT. SPACE - VADER'S STAR DESTROYER

Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves through space, guarded by its
convoy of TIE fighters.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - CONTROL DECK

Vader stands in the back control area of his ship's bridge with a
motley group of men and creatures.  Admiral Piett and two controllers
stand at the front of the bridge and watch the group with scorn.

PIETT
Bounty hunters.  We don't need
that scum.

FIRST CONTROLLER
Yes, sir.

PIETT
Those Rebels won't escape us.

A second controller interrupts.

SECOND CONTROLLER
Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Star Destroyer Avenger.

PIETT
Right.

The group standing before Vader is a bizarre array of galactic fortune
hunters  There is Bossk, a slimy, tentacled monster with two huge,
bloodshot eyes in a soft baggy face; Zuckuss and Dengar, two battle-
scarred, mangy human types; IG-88, a battered, tarnished chrome war
droid; and Boba Fett, a man in a weapon-covered armored space suit.

VADER
... there will be a substantial
reward for the one who finds the
Millennium Falcon.  You are free
to use any methods necessary, but
I want them alive.  No disintegrations.

BOBA FETT
As you wish.

At that moment, Admiral Piett approaches Vader in a rush of excitement.

PIETT
Lord Vader!  My lord, we have
them.

EXT. IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID BELT

The Millennium Falcon speeds through deep space, closely followed by a
firing Imperial Star Destroyer.  A large asteroid about the same size
as the Falcon tumbles rapidly toward the starship.  The tiny Falcon
banks to avoid the giant asteroid as smaller rocks pelt its surface.
Then the small craft roars under the asteroid which explodes harmlessly
on the hull of the vast Star Destroyer.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

The ship shudders as flak explodes near the cockpit window.  Threepio
checks a tracking scope an the side control panel while Leia watches
tensely out the window.

THREEPIO
Oh, thank goodness we're coming
out of the asteroid field.

Chewie barks excitedly as the rain of asteroids begins to subside.  A
bolt from the Star Destroyer sets up a fiery explosion on the back side
of the Falcon, causing it to lurch to one side.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - ASTEROID FIELD

The Falcon is hit hard by another bolt from the Star Destroyer which
creates a huge explosion near the cockpit of the smaller ship.  The
Falcon tilts steeply, then rights itself.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Han corrects the angle of his ship.

HAN
Let's get out of here.  Ready for
light-speed?  One... two... three!

Han pulls back on the hyperspace throttle and - nothing happens.  Flak
bursts continue to rock the ship.

HAN
(frantic)
It's not fair!

Chewie is very angry and starts to growl and bark at his friend and
captain.  Again, Han desperately pulls back on the throttle.

HAN
The transfer circuits are working.
It's not my fault!

Chewie puts his head in his hands, whining.

LEIA
(almost expecting
it)
No light-speed?

HAN
It's not my fault.

THREEPIO
Sir, we just lost the main rear
deflector shield.  One more direct
hit on the back quarter and we're
done for.

Han pauses for a moment, makes a decision, and pulls back on a lever.

HAN
Turn her around.

Chewie barks in puzzlement.

HAN
I said turn her around!  I'm
going to put all power in the
front shield.

LEIA
You're going to attack them?!

THREEPIO
Sir, the odds of surviving a
direct assault on an Imperial
Star Destroyer...

LEIA
Shut up!

EXT. SPACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON - ASTEROID FIELD

The Falcon banks, makes a steep, twisting turn.  In the next moment it
is racing toward the Star Destroyer, looking very small against the
massive surface of the Imperial ship.  As it moves across the surface
of the Star Destroyer, the Falcon bobs and weaves to avoid the numerous
flak bursts.

INT. STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER - BRIDGE

The tiny Falcon heads directly for the Avenger's bridge.  The Imperials
stationed there are stunned to see the small spaceship racing low
across the hull, headed directly at the huge windows of the bridge
area.  Alarms go off everywhere.  The Destroyer's commander, Captain
Needa, can scarcely believe his eyes.

NEEDA
They're moving to attack
position!  Shields up!

Needa and his men duck as the Falcon nears the bridge window.  At the
last minute, the Falcon veers off and out of sight.  All is quiet.

NEEDA
Track them.  They may come
around for another pass.

TRACKING OFFICER
Captain Needa, the ship no longer
appears on our scopes.

NEEDA
They can't have disappeared.  No
ship that small has a cloaking
device.

TRACKING OFFICER
Well, there's no trace of them,
sir.

COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
Captain, Lord Vader demands an
update on the pursuit.

NEEDA
(drawing a breath)
Get a shuttle ready.  I shall
assume full responsibility for
losing them, and apologize to Lord
Vader. Meanwhile, continue to
scan the area.

COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
Yes, Captain Needa.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - DAY

Luke's face is upside-down and showing enormous strain.  He stands on
his hands, with Yoda perched on his feet.  Opposite Luke and Yoda are
two rocks the size of bowling balls.  Luke stares at the rocks and
concentrates.  One of the rocks lifts from the ground and floats up to
rest on the other.

YODA
Use the Force.  Yes...

Yoda taps Luke's leg.  Quickly, Luke lifts one hand from the ground.
His body wavers, but he maintains his balance.  Artoo, standing nearby,
is whistling and beeping frantically.

YODA
Now... the stone.  Feel it.

Luke concentrates on trying to lift the top rock.  It rises a few feet,
shaking under the strain.  But, distracted by Artoo's frantic beeping,
Luke loses his balance and finally collapses.  Yoda jumps clear.

YODA
Concentrate!

Annoyed at the disturbance, Luke looks over at Artoo, who is rocking
urgently back and forth in front of him.

Artoo waddles closer to Luke, chirping wildly, then scoots over the
edge of the swamp.  Catching on, Luke rushes to the water's edge.  The
X-wing fighter has sunk, and only the tip of its nose shows above the
lake's surface.

LUKE
Oh, no.  We'll never get it out
now.

Yoda stamps his foot in irritation.

YODA
So certain are you.  Always with
you it cannot be done.  Hear you
nothing that I say?

Luke looks uncertainly out at the ship.

LUKE
Master, moving stones around is
one thing.  This is totally
different.

YODA
No!  No different!  Only different
in your mind.  You must unlearn
what you have learned.

LUKE
(focusing, quietly)
All right, I'll give it a try.

YODA
No!  Try not.  Do.  Or do not.
There is no try.

Luke closes his eyes and concentrates on thinking the ship out.

Slowly, the X-wing's nose begins to rise above the water.  It hovers
for a moment and then slides back, disappearing once again.

LUKE
(panting heavily)
I can't.  It's too big.

YODA
Size matters not.  Look at me.
Judge me by my size, do you?
Hm?  Mmmm.

Luke shakes his head.

YODA
And well you should not.  For my
ally in the Force.  And a powerful
ally it is.  Life creates it, makes
it grow.  Its energy surrounds us
and binds us.  Luminous beings
are we...
(Yoda pinches
Luke's shoulder)
... not this crude matter.
(a sweeping gesture)
You must feel the Force around you.
(gesturing)
Here, between you... me... the
tree... the rock... everywhere!
Yes, even between this land and
that ship!

LUKE
(discouraged)
You want the impossible.

Quietly Yoda turns toward the X-wing fighter.  With his eyes closed and
his head bowed, he raises his arm and points at the ship.

Soon, the fighter rises above the water and moves forward as Artoo
beeps in terror and scoots away.

The entire X-wing moves majestically, surely, toward the shore.  Yoda
stands on a tree root and guides the fighter carefully down toward the
beach.

Luke stares in astonishment as the fighter settles down onto the shore.
He walks toward Yoda.

LUKE
I don't... I don't believe it.

YODA
That is why you fail.

Luke shakes his head, bewildered.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET

The fleet around Vader's Star Destroyer now includes Needa's Star
Destroyer, the Avenger.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

VADER
Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

Clutching desperately at his throat, Captain Needa slumps down, then
falls over on his back, at the feet of Darth Vader.  Two stormtroopers
pick up the lifeless body and carry it quickly away as Admiral Piett
and two of his captains hurry up to the Dark Lord.

PIETT
Lord Vader, our ships have
completed their scan of the area
and found nothing.  If the
Millennium Falcon went into light-
speed, it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy by now.

VADER
Alert all commands.  Calculate
every possible destination along
their last know trajectory.

PIETT
Yes, my lord.  We'll find them.

VADER
Don't fail me again, Admiral.

Vader exits as the admiral turns to an aide, a little more uneasy than
when he arrived.

PIETT
Alert all commands.  Deploy the fleet.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET

Vader's ship moves away, flanked by its fleet of smaller ships.  the
Avenger glides off into space in the opposite direction.  No one on
that ship or on Vader's is aware that, clinging to the side of the
Avenger, is the pirateship, the Millennium Falcon.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

THREEPIO
Captain Solo, this time you have
gone too far.
(Chewie growls)
No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

HAN
(to Chewie)
The fleet is beginning to break
up.  Go back and stand by the
manual release for the landing claw.

Chewie barks, struggles from his seat, and climbs out of the cabin.

THREEPIO
I really don't see how that is
going to help.  Surrender is a
perfectly acceptable alternative
in extreme circumstances.  The
Empire may be gracious enough...

Leia reaches over and shuts off Threepio, mid-sentence.

HAN
Thank you.

LEIA
What did you have in mind for
your next move?

HAN
Well, if they follow standard
Imperial procedure, they'll dump
their garbage before they go to
light-speed, then we just float
away.

LEIA
With the rest of the garbage.
Then what?

HAN
Then we've got to find a safe
port somewhere around here.  Got
any ideas?

LEIA
No.  Where are we?

HAN
The Anoat system.

LEIA
Anoat system.  There's not much
there.

HAN
No.  Well, wait.  This is
interesting.  Lando.

He points to a computer mapscreen on the control panel.  Leia slips out
of her chair and moves next to the handsome pilot.  Small light points
representing several systems flash by on the computer screen.

LEIA
Lando system?

HAN
Lando's not a system, he's a man.
Lando Calrissian.  He's a card
player, gambler, scoundrel.  You'd
like him.

LEIA
Thanks.

HAN
Bespin.  It's pretty far, but I
think we can make it.

LEIA
(reading from the
computer)
A mining colony?

HAN
Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.  Lando
conned somebody out of it.  We
go back a long way, Lando and me.

LEIA
Can you trust him?

HAN
No.  But he has no love for the
Empire, I can tell you that.

Chewie barks over the intercom.  Han quickly changes his readouts and
stretches to look out the cockpit window.

HAN
(into intercom)
Here we go, Chewie.  Stand by.
Detach!

Han leans back in his chair and gives Leia an invisible smile.  She
thinks for a moment, shakes her head; a grin creeps across her face and
she gives him a quick kiss.

LEIA
You do have your moments.  Not
many, but you have them.

EXT. SPACE - IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER

As the Avenger Star Destroyer moves slowly into space, the hatch on its
underbelly opens, sending a trail of junk behind it.  Hidden among the
refuse, the Falcon tumbles away.  In the next moment, the Avenger roars
off into hyperspace.  The Falcon's engines are ignited, and it races
off into the distance.  Amidst the slowly drifting junk, Boba Fett's
ship appears and moves after the Falcon.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - CLEARING - DAY

In the clearing behind Yoda's house, Luke again stands upside-down, but
his face shows less strain and more concentration than before.  Yoda
sits on the ground below the young warrior.  On the other side of the
clearing, two equipment cases slowly rise into the air.  Nearby Artoo
watches, humming to himself, when suddenly he, too, rises into the air.
His little legs kick desperately and his head turns frantically,
looking for help.

YODA
Concentrate... feel the Force
flow.  Yes.  Good.  Calm, yes.
Through the Force, things you
will see.  Other places.  The
future... the past.  Old friends
long gone.

Luke suddenly becomes distressed.

LUKE
Han!  Leia!

The two packing boxes and Artoo fall to the ground with a crash, then
Luke himself tumbles over.

YODA
(shaking his head)
Hmm.  Control, control.  You must
learn control.

LUKE
I saw... I saw a city in the
clouds.

YODA
Mmm.  Friends you have there.

LUKE
They were in pain.

YODA
It is the future you see.

LUKE
Future?  Will they die?

Yoda closes his eyes and lowers his head.

YODA
Difficult to see.  Always in
motion is the future.

LUKE
I've got to go to them.

YODA
Decide you must how to serve
them best.  If you leave now,
help them you could.  But you
would destroy all for which they
have fought and suffered.

Luke is stopped cold by Yoda's words.  Gloom shrouds him as he nods his
head sadly.

EXT. BESPIN SYSTEM - MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAWN

The powerful pirate starship blasts through space as it heads toward
the soft pink planet of Bespin.

EXT. BESPIN SURFACE - MILLENNIUM FALCON

It is down on the gaseous planet.  Huge billowing clouds form a canyon
as the ship banks around them, heading toward the system's Cloud City.

Suddenly, two twin-pod cloud cars appear and move toward the Falcon.
The cloud cars draw up alongside the starship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

One of the cloud cars opens fire on the Falcon, its flak rocking the
ship.  Chewie barks his concern.

HAN
(into transmitter)
No, I don't have a landing
permit.  I'm trying to reach
Lando Calrissian.

More flak bursts outside the cockpit window and rattles the ship's
interior.  Leia looks worried.

HAN
(into transmitter)
Whoa!  Wait a minute!  Let me
explain.

INTERCOM VOICE
You will not deviate from your
present course.

THREEPIO
Rather touchy, aren't they?

LEIA
I thought you knew this person.

Chewie barks and growls at his boss.

HAN
(to Chewie)
Well, that was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's forgotten about
that.

INTERCOM VOICE
Permission granted to land on
Platform Three-two-seven.

HAN
(into transmitter)
Thank you.

Angry, Han snaps off the intercom.  Chewie looks at him and grunts.
Han turns to the worried princess and her droid.

HAN
There's nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.

Leia doesn't look convinced.

LEIA
Who's worried?

EXT. CLOUD CITY - MILLENNIUM FALCON - CLOUD CARS

The clouds part to reveal a full view of the city as it bobs in and out
of the cloud surface.  The cloud cars and the Falcon head for the
gleaming white metropolis.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM - MILLENNIUM FALCON

With the cloud cars still guarding it, the Falcon lands on one of the
Cloud City's platforms.

EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON

Han and Leia stand at the open door, armed.  Behind them, Chewie, also
armed, surveys the scene warily.

THREEPIO
Oh.  No one to meet us.

LEIA
I don't like this.

HAN
Well, what would you like?

THREEPIO
Well, they did let us land.

HAN
Look, don't worry.  Everything's
going to be fine.  Trust me.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY

Lando Calrissian, a suave, dashing black man in his thirties, leads a
group of aides and some Cloud City guard rapidly toward the landing
platform.

The group, like the other citizens of the city, is a motley collection
of aliens, droids, and humans of all descriptions.  Lando has a grim
expression on his face as he moves onto the landing platform.

EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON

HAN
See?  My friend.
(to Chewie)
Keep your eyes open, okay?

Chewie growls as Han walks down the ramp.  Lando and his men head
across the bridge to meet the space pirate.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM

Lando stops ten feet from Han.  The two men eye each other carefully.
Lando shakes his head.

LANDO
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler!  You've got a
lot of guts coming here, after
what you pulled.

Han points to himself innocently, mouthing, "Me?"

Lando moves threateningly toward Han.  Suddenly, he throws his arms
around his startled, long-lost friend and embraces him.

LANDO
(laughs)
How you doing, you old pirate?
So good to see you!  I never thought
I'd catch up with you again.  Where
you been?

The two old friends embrace, laughing and chuckling.

EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON.

THREEPIO
Well, he seems very friendly.

LEIA
(wary)
Yes... very friendly.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM

LANDO
What are you doing here?

HAN
(gestures toward
the Falcon)
Ahh... repairs.  I thought you
could help me out.

LANDO
(in mock panic)
What have you done to my ship?

HAN
Your ship?  Hey, remember, you
lost her to me fair and square.

Chewie growls a reserved greeting.  Lando suddenly notices the princess
and smiles.

LANDO
Hello.  What have we here?
Welcome.  I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this
facility.  And who might you be?

LEIA
Leia.

LANDO
Welcome, Leia.

Lando bows before Leia and kisses her hand.

HAN
All right, all right, you old
smoothie.

Han takes Leia by the hand and steers her away from Lando.

THREEPIO
Hello, sir.  I am See-Threepio,
human-cyborg relations.  My
facilities are at your...

Before Threepio can finish his self-introduction, Lando has turned to
follow Han and Leia, who are walking toward the city.

THREEPIO
Well, really!

Lando, his aide, Lobot, and Han lead the way across the bridge,
followed by Threepio, Chewie and Leia.

LANDO
What's wrong with the Falcon?

HAN
Hyperdrive.

LANDO
I'll get my people to work on it.

HAN
Good.

Lando turns to Leia.

LANDO
You know, that ship saved my life
quite a few times.  She's the
fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

The group has crossed the narrow bridge and entered the city.  They
walk down the lovely Art Deco passageway, rounding several corners and
passing many small plazas as they go.  Threepio lags a bit behind.

HAN
How's the gas mine?  Is it
paying off for you?

LANDO
Oh, not as well as I'd like.
We're a small outpost and not
very self-sufficient.  And I've
had supply problems of every kind.
I've had labor difficulties...
(catches Han
grinning at him)
What's so funny?

HAN
You.  Listen to you - you sound
like a businessman, a responsible
leader.  Who'd have thought that,
huh?

Lando is reflective.  He looks at Han a moment.

LANDO
You know, seeing you sure
brings back a few things.

HAN
Yeah.

LANDO
(shakes his head)
Yeah.  I'm responsible these days.
It's the price you pay for being
successful.

Han and Lando laugh together, and the group moves on through the
corridor.

The lagging Threepio passes a Threepio-type silver droid who is coming
out of a door.

THREEPIO
Oh!  Nice to see a familiar face.

SECOND THREEPIO
(mumbles)
E chu ta!

THREEPIO
How rude!

Threepio stops, watching the silver droid move away.  Then he hears the
muffled beeping and whistling of an R2 unit coming from within the
room.

INT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOM

Curious, Threepio enters the room.

THREEPIO
That sounds like an R2 unit in
there.  I wonder if...

Threepio walks through the doorway to the main room.  He looks in.

THREEPIO
Hello?  How interesting.  Oh, my.

MAN'S VOICE
(from within)
Who are you?

THREEPIO
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.  I... I
didn't mean to intrude.  No, no,
please don't get up.  No!

A laser bolt to Threepio's chest sends him flying in twenty directions.
Smoldering mechanical arms and legs bounce off the walls as the door
whooshes closed behind him.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

Lando, Han, and Leia continue down the corridor unaware of Threepio's
dreadful accident.  Chewbacca glances around, sniffs the air, but
shrugs his shoulders and follows the group.

EXT. DAGOBAH - BOG - DUSK

In the bright lights of the fighter, Luke loads a heavy case into the
belly of the ship.  Artoo sits on top of the X-wing, settling down into
his cubbyhole.  Yoda stands nearby on a log.

YODA
Luke!  You must complete the
training.

LUKE
I can't keep the vision out of my
head.  They're my friends.  I've
got to help them.

YODA
You must not go!

LUKE
But Han and Leia will die if I
don't.

BEN'S VOICE
You don't know that.

Luke looks toward the voice in amazement.  Ben has materialized as a
real, slightly shimmering image near Yoda.  The power of his presence
stops Luke.

BEN
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

LUKE
But I can help them!  I feel
the Force!

BEN
But you cannot control it.  This
is a dangerous time for you,
when you will be tempted by the
dark side of the Force.

YODA
Yes, yes.  To Obi-Wan you listen.
The cave.  Remember your failure
at the cave!

LUKE
But I've learned so much since
then.  Master Yoda, I promise to
return and finish what I've begun.
You have my word.

BEN
It is you and your abilities the
Emperor wants.  that is why your
friends are made to suffer.

LUKE
And that is why I have to go.

BEN
Luke, I don't want to lose you to
the Emperor the way I lost Vader.

LUKE
You won't.

YODA
Stopped they must be.  On this
all depends.  Only a fully trained
Jedi Knight with the Force as his
ally will conquer Vader and his
Emperor.  If you end your training
now, if you choose the quick and
easy path, as Vader did, you will
become an agent of evil.

BEN
Patience.

LUKE
And sacrifice Han and Leia?

YODA
If you honor what they fight for
... yes!

Luke is in great anguish.  He struggles with the dilemma, a battle
raging in his mind.

BEN
If you choose to face Vader, you
will do it alone.  I cannot
interfere.

LUKE
I understand.
(he moves to his
X-wing)
Artoo, fire up the converters.

Artoo whistles a happy reply.

BEN
Luke, don't give in to hate -
that leads to the dark side.

Luke nods and climbs into his ship.

YODA
Strong is Vader.  Mind what you
have learned.  Save you it can.

LUKE
I will.  And I'll return.  I promise.

Artoo closes the cockpit.  Ben and Yoda stand watching as the roar of
the engines and the wind engulf them.

YODA
(sighs)
Told you, I did.  Reckless is
he.  Now matters are worse.

BEN
That boy is our last hope.

YODA
(looks up)
No.  There is another.

EXT. SPACE - PLANET DAGOBAH

Luke's tiny X-wing rockets away from the green planet of Dagobah and
off into space.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY

Within the quarters assigned her on Cloud City, Leia paces in
agitation.  She has changed from her cold-weather pants and jacket to a
lovely dress.  Her hair is down, tied back with ribbons.  She moves
from a large, open window and turns to see Han entering through the
doorway.

HAN
The ship is almost finished.
Two or Three more things and
we're in great shape.

LEIA
The sooner the better.  Something's
wrong here.  No one has seen or
knows anything about Threepio.
He's been gone too long to have
gotten lost.

Han takes Leia by the shoulders and gently kisses her forehead.

HAN
Relax.  I'll talk to Lando and
see what I can find out.

LEIA
I don't trust Lando.

HAN
Well, I don't trust him, either.
But he is my friend.  Besides,
we'll soon be gone.

LEIA
And then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

Not speaking, Han considers her words and gazes at her troubled face.

INT. CLOUD CITY - JUNK ROOM

The room is piled high with broken and discarded machine parts.  Four
Ugnaughts, small hoglike creatures, separate the junk and throw some
pieces onto a conveyer belt which moves briskly toward a pit of molten
metal.  Pieces of Threepio's golden body move down the belt.  Chewie
enters the room and spots an Ugnaught picking up and inspecting
Threepio's head.  The Wookiee barks a command, startling the Ugnaught,
then reaches to grab the head.  But the Ugnaught tosses it away from
him to another Ugnaught.  This game of keep-away goes on until
Threepio's head falls from their grip and bounces with a clang onto the
ground.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LIVING QUARTERS - DAY

The door zaps open.  Chewbacca walks in, carrying a packing case of
Threepio, arms and legs hanging over the edge.

LEIA
What happened?

Chewie sets the case on a table, grunting and groaning an explanation.

HAN
Where?  Found him in a junk pile?

LEIA
Oh, what a mess.  Chewie, do you
think you can repair him?

The giant Wookiee studies the array of robot parts.  He looks at the
princess and shrugs sadly.

HAN
Lando's got people who can fix
him.

LEIA
No, thanks.

There is a buzz and the door slides open, revealing Lando.

LANDO
I'm sorry.  Am I interrupting
anything?

LEIA
Not really.

LANDO
You look absolutely beautiful.
You truly belong here with us
among the clouds.

LEIA
(coolly)
Thank you.

LANDO
Will you join me for a little
refreshment?

Han looks at Lando suspiciously, but Chewie barks at the mention of
food and licks his lips.

LANDO
Everyone's invited, of course.

Leia takes Lando's proffered arm, and the group turns to go.  Lando
spots Threepio's remains.

LANDO
Having trouble with you droid?

Han and Leia exchange a quick glance.

HAN
No.  No problem.  Why?

Han and Leia move arm-in-arm through the door, followed by Lando and
Chewie.  The door slides closed behind them.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY

Leia walks between Han and Lando as Chewie follows a short distance
behind.  Long shafts of light pour across the corridor between tall,
pure-white columns.

LANDO
So you see, since we're a small
operation, we don't fall into
the... uh... jurisdiction of the
Empire.

LEIA
So you're part of the mining
guild then?

LANDO
No, not actually.  Our operation
is small enough not to be noticed...
which is advantageous for everybody
since our customers are anxious
to avoid attracting attention to
themselves.

The group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge doorway at
the far end.

HAN
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
going to find out about this
little operation and shut you down?

LANDO
That's always been a danger looming
like a shadow over everything we've
built here.  But things have
developed that will insure security.
I've just made a deal that will
keep the Empire out of here forever.

INT. CLOUD CITY - DINING ROOM

The mighty doors to the dining room slide open and the group enters the
dining room.  At the far end of a huge banquet table sits Darth Vader.
Standing at his side and slightly behind him is Boba Fett, the bounty
hunter.

Faster than the wink of an eye, Han draws his blaster and pops off a
couple of shots directly at Vader.  The Dark Lord quickly raises his
hand, deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls, where they
explode harmlessly.  Just as quickly, Han's weapon zips into Vader's
hand.  The evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of
him.

VADER
We would be honored if you would
join us.

Han gives Lando a mean look.

LANDO
I had no choice.  They arrived
right before you did.  I'm sorry.

HAN
I'm sorry, too.

EXT.  LUKE'S X-WING - BESPIN SYSTEM

Luke's X-wing races through thick clouds toward Cloud City.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke is grim-faced as he pilots his course toward Bespin's shining
city.  Artoo's beeps and whistles are transmitted onto the scope.

LUKE
(into comlink)
No, Threepio's with them.

Artoo whistles another worried inquiry.

LUKE
(into comlink)
Just hang on.  We're almost there.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL

Chewbacca is in a Cloud City prison cell.  The stark room is flooded
with hot light.  To add to Chewie's misery, a high-pitched whistle
screeches loudly.  Chewie is going mad.  He hits the wall with giant
fists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor.  The upper
lights go off abruptly.  The prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a
wall, where he listens for a moment.  Then, moaning to himself, he
moves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of Threepio lie.  He
picks up the golden droid's head and meditates on it for a moment,
barking a few philosophical remarks.  Chewie sticks the robot's head on
its torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits.

Suddenly, the lights in Threepio's eyes spark to life as Chewie touches
two connectors together.  Threepio immediately begins to speak, but his
voice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible.

THREEPIO
Mmmm.  Oh, my.  Uh, I, uh - Take
this off!  I, uh, don't mean to
intrude here.  I, don't, no, no,
no... Please don't get up.  No!

Chewie looks at Threepio in bewilderment, then scratches his furry
head.  He gets an idea and adjusts some connections, whereupon Threepio
immediately begins speaking normally.

THREEPIO
Stormtroopers?  Here?  We're in
danger.  I must tell the others.
Oh, no!  I've been shot!

INT. CLOUD CITY - PRISON ENTRY AREA

Darth Vader strides through the room as two stormtroopers prepare an
elaborate torture mechanism.  Han is strapped to a rack which tilts
forward onto the torture device.  Vader activates the mechanism,
creating two bursts of sparks, one of which strikes Han's face.

The door opens, and Vader leaves the torture room just as Han screams a
sharp, piercing cry of agony.  Darth Vader moves to the holding
chamber, where Lando and Boba Fett await him.

INT. CLOUD CITY - HOLDING CHAMBER

LANDO
Lord Vader.

VADER
(to Fett)
You may take Captain Solo to
Jabba the Hut after I have
Skywalker.

Han's screams filter through the torture room door.

BOBA FETT
He's no good to me dead.

VADER
He will not be permanently damaged.

LANDO
Lord Vader, what about Leia and
the Wookiee?

VADER
They must never again leave this
city.

LANDO
That was never a condition of our
agreement, nor was giving Han to
this bounty hunter!

VADER
Perhaps you think you're being
treated unfairly.

LANDO
No.

VADER
Good.  It would be unfortunate if
I had to leave a garrison here.

Vader turns and sweeps into the elevator with Boba Fett.  Lando walks
swiftly down another corridor, muttering to himself.

LANDO
This deal's getting worse all
the time.

INT. CLOUD CITY - LARGE CELL

Chewie now has a little more of Threepio back together.  One arm is
connected, but the legs are yet to be attached.  There is one small
problem, however.  It seems the Wookiee has managed to put the droid's
head on backwards.

THREEPIO
Oh, yes, that's very good.  I like
that.  Oh!  Something's not right
because now I can't see.  Wait.
Wait!  Oh, my!  what have you done?
I'm backwards, you stupid furball.
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough...

Threepio is cut off in mid-sentence as Chewie angrily deactivates a
circuit and the droid shuts down.  The Wookiee smells something and
sits up.  The door to the chamber slides open and a ragged Han Solo is
shoved into the room by two stormtroopers.  Barking his concern, the
huge Wookiee gives Han a big hug.  Han is very pale, with dark circles
under his eyes.

HAN
I feel terrible.

Chewie helps Han to a platform and then turns as the door slides open
revealing Leia.  She, too, looks a little worse for wear.  The troopers
push her into the cell, and the door slides closed.  She moves to Han,
who is lying on the platform, and kneels next to him, gently stroking
his head.

LEIA
Why are they doing this?

HAN
They never even asked me any
questions.

The cell door slides open.  Lando and two of his guards enter.

LEIA
Lando.

HAN
Get out of here, Lando!

LANDO
Shut up and listen!  Vader has
agreed to turn Leia and Chewie
over to me.

HAN
Over to you?

LANDO
They'll have to stay here, but at
least they'll be safe.

LEIA
What about Han?

LANDO
Vader's giving him to the bounty
hunter.

LEIA
Vader wants us all dead.

LANDO
He doesn't want you at all.  He's
after somebody called Skywalker.

HAN
Luke?

LANDO
Lord Vader has set a trap for him.

Leia's mind is racing.

LEIA
And we're the bait.

LANDO
Well, he's on his way.

Han's rage peaks.

HAN
Perfect.  You fixed us all pretty
good, didn't you?
(spits it out)
My friend!

Han hauls off and punches Lando.  The two friends are instantly engaged
in a frantic close-quarters fight.  The guards hit Han with their rifle
butts and he flies across the room.  Chewie growls and starts for the
guards.  They point their laser weapons at the giant Wookiee, but Lando
stops them.

LANDO
Stop!  I've done all I can.  I'm
sorry I couldn't do better, but
I have my own problems.

HAN
Yeah, you're a real hero.

Lando and the guards leave.  Han wipes the blood from his chin as Leia
and Chewie help him up.

LEIA
(dabs at his wound)
You certainly have a way with
people.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

Four armor-suited stormtroopers stand at the ready in the large
chamber, which is filled with pipes and chemical tanks.  In the middle
of the room is a round pit housing a hydraulic platform.  Darth Vader
and Lando stand near the platform.

VADER
This facility is crude, but it
should be adequate to freeze
Skywalker for his journey to the
Emperor.

An Imperial soldier appears.

IMPERIAL SOLDIER
Lord Vader, ship approaching.
X-wing class.

VADER
Good.  Monitor Skywalker and allow
him to land.

The soldier bows and leaves the chamber.

LANDO
Lord Vader, we only use this
facility for carbon freezing.  If
you put him in there, it might
kill him.

VADER
I do not want the Emperor's prize
damaged.  We will test it... on
Captain Solo.

Lando's face registers dismay.

EXT. SPACE - BESPIN SYSTEM -  LUKE'S X-WING

Luke's X-wing moves through the clouds as it nears the city.

INT.  LUKE'S X-WING - COCKPIT

Encountering no city guards, Luke scans the display panel with concern.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

There is a great activity on the carbon-freezing platform.  Six
Ugnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use.  A special
coffinlike container is put in place.  With Boba Fett in the lead, a
squad of six stormtroopers brings in Han, Leia and Chewie.  Strapped to
Chewie's back, with only his head, torso, and one arm assembled, is
Threepio.  Threepio's head faces the opposite direction from Chewie's
and the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see
what is happening.  His one attached arm is animate and expressive,
intermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes.  The
remaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the Wookiee's back
so that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack.

THREEPIO
If only you had attached my legs,
I wouldn't be in this ridiculous
position.  Now, remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility to me,
so don't do anything foolish.

HAN
(to Lando)
What's going on... buddy?

LANDO
You're being put into carbon freeze.

Boba Fett moves away from the group to Darth Vader.

BOBA FETT
What if he doesn't survive?  He's
worth a lot to me.

VADER
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies.  Put him in!

Realizing what is about to happen, Chewie lets out a wild howl and
attacks the stormtroopers surrounding Han.  Within seconds, other
Imperial reinforcements join the scuffle, clubbing the giant Wookiee
with their laser weapons.

From the instant of Chewie's first move, Threepio begins to scream in
panic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm.

THREEPIO
Oh, no!  No, no, no!  Stop,
Chewbacca, stop...!

The stormtroopers are about to bash Chewie in the face.

HAN
Stop, Chewie, stop!  Do you hear
me?  Stop!

THREEPIO
Yes, stop, please!  I'm not ready
to die.

Han breaks away from his captors.  Vader nods to the guards to let him
go and the pirate breaks up the fight.

HAN
Chewie!  Chewie, this won't help
me.  Hey!

Han gives the Wookiee a stern look.

HAN
Save your strength.  There'll be
another time.  The princess - you
have to take care of her.  You
hear me?

Han winks at the Wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell.

In a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca, who is too
distraught to protest.  Han turns to Princess Leia.  They look
sorrowfully at one another, then Han moves toward her and gives her a
final, passionate kiss.

LEIA
I love you!

HAN
I know.

Tears roll down Leia's face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to
the hydraulic platform.  Han looks one final time at his friends - and
then, suddenly, the platform drops.  Chewie howls.  Leia turns away in
agony.

Lando winces in sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him.

Instantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and
fluid as great as any steel furnace.  Holding Leia, Chewie half-turns
away from the sight, giving Threepio a view of the procedure.

THREEPIO
What... what's going on?  Turn
round, Chewbacca, I can't see.
Oh... they've encased him in
carbonite.  He should be quite
well-protected - if he survives
the freezing process, that is.

Chewie is in no mood for technical discussion; he gives the droid an
angry glance and bark.

A huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal-encased space pirate
out of the vat and stands him on the platform.  Some Ugnaughts rush
over and push the block over onto the platform.  They slide the
coffinlike structure to the block and lift the metal block, placing it
inside.  They then attach an electronic box onto the structure and step
away.  Lando kneels and adjusts some knobs, measuring the heat.  He
shakes his head in relief.

VADER
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

LANDO
Yes, he's alive.  And in perfect
hibernation.

Vader turns to Boba Fett.

VADER
He's all yours bounty hunter.
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

IMPERIAL OFFICER
Skywalker has just landed, my
lord.

VADER
Good.  See to it that he finds
his way here.  Calrissian, take
the princess and the Wookiee to
my ship.

LANDO
You said they'd be left in the
city under my supervision.

VADER
I am altering the deal.  Pray I
don't alter it any further.

Lando's hand instinctively goes to his throat as he turns to Leia,
Chewie, and Threepio.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR - DAY

As Luke and Artoo move carefully down a deserted corridor, they hear a
group of people coming down a side hallway.  Artoo lets out an excited
series of beeps and whistles.  Luke glares at the tiny droid, who stops
in his tracks with a feeble squeak.

Boba Fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the
floating, encased body of Han Solo.  Two stormtroopers, who follow,
immediately spot Luke and open fire on him.  The youth draws his weapon
and blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot.  The
two guards whisk Han into another hallway as Fett lowers his arm and
fires a deadly laser at Luke, which explodes to one side and tears up a
huge chunk of wall.

Luke rushes to a side hallway, but by the time he reaches it, Fett,
Han, and the guards are gone.  A think metal door blocks the passage.
Luke turns to see Leia, Chewie, Threepio, and Lando being herded down a
second hallway by several other stormtroopers.  Leia turns just in time
to see Luke.

LEIA
Luke!  Luke, don't - it's a
trap!  It's a trap!

Before she can finish, she is pulled through a doorway and disappears
from sight.  Luke races after the group, leaving little Artoo trailing
behind.

INT. CLOUD CITY - ANTEROOM

Luke runs into an anteroom and stops to get his bearings.  Leia and the
others are nowhere to be seen.  Behind Luke, Artoo scoots down the
corridor toward the anteroom when suddenly a giant metal door comes
slamming down, cutting off Luke's exit.  Several more doors clang shut,
echoing through the chamber.

INT. CLOUD CITY - HALLWAY LEADING TO ANTEROOM

Artoo stands with his nose pressed against the giant metal door.  He
whistles a long sigh of relief and, a little dazed, wanders off in the
other direction.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER - ANTEROOM

Luke cautiously walks forward among hissing pipes and steam.  Seeing an
opening above him, he stops to look up.  As he does, the platform he
stands on begins to move.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

Luke rises into the chamber, borne by the platform.  The room is
deathly quiet.  Very little steam escapes the pipes and no one else
seems to be in the large room.  Warily, Luke walks toward the stairway.

Steam begins to build up in the chamber.  Looking up through the steam,
Luke sees a dark figure standing on a walkway above him.  Luke holsters
his gun and moves up the stairs to face Vader.  He feels confident,
eager to engage his enemy.

VADER
The Force is with you, young
Skywalker.  But you are not a
Jedi yet.

Luke ignites his sword in answer.  In an instant, Vader's own sword is
lit.  Luke lunges, but Vader repels the blow.  Again Luke attacks, and
the swords of the two combatants clash in battle.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

Leia, Lando, and Chewie, with Threepio on his back, march along,
guarded by six stormtroopers.  The group reaches an intersection where
Lobot and a dozen of Lando's guards stand at attention.

The guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled stormtroopers.
Taking the stormtroopers' weapons from them, Lobot hands one to Leia
and one to Lando.

LANDO
Well done.  Hold them in the
security tower - and keep it
quiet.  Move.

As Lando's guards quickly march the stormtroopers away, Lando begins to
undo Chewie's binding.

LEIA
What do you think you're doing?

LANDO
We're getting out of here.

THREEPIO
I knew all along it had to be a
mistake.

Chewie turns on Lando and starts to choke him.

LEIA
Do you think that after what you
did to Han we're going to trust
you?

Lando tries to free himself from Chewie.

LANDO
(choking)
I had no choice...

Chewie barks ferociously.

THREEPIO
(to Chewie)
What are you doing?  Trust him,
trust him!

LEIA
Oh, so we understand, don't we,
Chewie?  He had no choice.

LANDO
I'm just trying to help...

LEIA
We don't need any of your help.

LANDO
(choking)
H-a-a-a...

LEIA
What?

THREEPIO
It sounds like Han.

LANDO
There's still a chance to save
Han... I mean, at the East
Platform...

LEIA
Chewie.

Chewie finally releases Lando, who fights to get his breath back.

THREEPIO
(to Lando)
I'm terribly sorry about all this.
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - EAST LANDING PLATFORM - BOBA FETT'S SHIP

The two guards slide Han's encased body into an opening in the side of
the bounty hunter's ship.  Boba Fett climb aboard on a ladder next to
the cargo hold.

BOBA FETT
Put Captain Solo in the cargo
hold.

And with that, the door slams shut.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

Lando, Leia, and Chewie run down a Cloud City corridor when suddenly
they spot Artoo who rushes toward them, beeping wildly.

THREEPIO
Artoo!  Artoo!  Where have you
been?

Chewie turns around to see the stubby droid, causing Threepio to be
spun out of sight of his friend.

THREEPIO
Turn around, you wooly...!
(to Artoo)
Hurry, hurry!  We're trying to
save Han from the bounty hunter!

Whistling frantically to Threepio, Artoo scoots along with the racing
group.

THREEPIO
Well, at least your still in
one piece!  Look what happened to
me!

EXT. EAST LANDING PLATFORM - SIDE BAY

An elevator door slides open and Lando, Leia, and Chewbacca race for a
large bay overlooking the East Landing Platform.

Just as they arrive, Boba Fett's ship takes off against a cloudy sunset
sky.

In wild anguish, Chewie howls and starts firing at the ship.

THREEPIO
Oh, no!  Chewie, they're behind
you!

A laser bolt explodes near the princess.  Everyone turns to see what
Threepio has already spotted coming from the other direction; a squad
of stormtroopers running toward them.  Artoo peeks out from the
elevator.

Leia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando makes a break
for the elevator.  Laser bolts continue to explode around the princess
and the Wookiee, but they refuse to budge.  Lando sticks his head out
of the elevator and motions for the pair to run, but they barely
notice.  They seem possessed, transported, as all the frustration of
captivity and anger of loss pour through their death-dealing weapons.

But after a few moments, they begin to move through the rain of laser
fire toward the elevator.  Once they are inside, the door slams shut
and the stormtroopers race forward.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

Luke and Vader are locked in combat on the platform overlooking the
chamber.  Their swords clash, the platform sways.  Luke aggressively
drives Vader back, forcing Vader to use defensive tactics.

VADER
You have learned much, young one.

LUKE
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

Vader makes two quick moves, hooking Luke's sword out of his hand and
sending it flying.  Another lightning move at Luke's feet forces the
youth to jump back to protect himself.  Losing his balance, Luke rolls
down the stairs to the circular carbon-freezing platform.  There he
sprawls on the floor, surprised and shaken.  Just in time he looks up
to see Vader, like a giant black bird, flying right at him.  Luke rolls
away as Vader lands.  Crouching, Luke keeps his gaze steadily on his
enemy.

VADER
Your destiny lies with me,
Skywalker.  Obi-Wan knew this to
be true.

LUKE
No!

Behind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly.  All
the while, Luke slowly, cautiously moves back, away from the Dark Lord.

Suddenly, Vader attacks so forcefully that Luke loses his balance and
falls back into the opening.  There is a rumble, and in an instant
freezing steam rises to obscure Vader's vision.   Vader turns aside and
deactivates his sword.

VADER
All to easy.  Perhaps you are not
as strong as the Emperor thought.

Through the steam behind Vader something blurs upward.  Liquid metal
begins to pour into the pit.

Vader turns around - and then looks up.  He sees Luke, who has leaped
fifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the
carbonite outlet.

VADER
Impressive... most impressive.

Luke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from Vader by the
steaming carbonite pit.  He raises his hand.  His sword, which had
fallen on another part of the platform, swiftly jumps into his
outstretched hand and is instantly ignited.  Vader immediately lights
his sword as well.

VADER
Obi-Wan has taught you well.  You
have controlled your fear... now
release your anger.

Luke is more cautious, controlling his anger.  He begins to retreat as
Vader goads him on.  As Luke takes a defensive position, he realizes he
has been foolhardy.  A quick sword exchange and Luke forces Vader back.
Another exchange and Vader retreats.  Luke presses forward.

VADER
Only your hatred can destroy me.

Breathing hard, Luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault over Vader.
He lands on the floor and slashes at Vader as the room continues to
fill up with steam.

Vader retreats before Luke's skillful sword.  Vader blocks the sword,
but looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes.  The
energy Luke has used to stop Vader has brought him to the point of
collapse.  Luke moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of
Vader.  He then deactivates his sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers
himself into the pit.

INT. CLOUD CITY - TUNNEL AND REACTOR CONTROL ROOM

Moving through a tunnellike entrance, Luke cautiously approaches the
reactor room.  He ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward
a large window as Vader enters.

Luke raises his sword and moves forward to attack.

Behind Luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall
and comes smashing forward toward his back.  Luke turns and cuts it in
half just as another machine comes hurtling at him.  Using the Force,
Luke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an
invisible shield.

A large pipe detaches and comes flying at Luke.  He deflects it.
Sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth.
Small tools and equipment come flying at him.  Bombardment from all
sides, Luke does his best to deflect everything, but soon he is
bloodied and bruised.  Finally, one machine glances off his and goes
flying out the large window.  A fierce wind blows into the room,
unmoving, stands the dark, rocklike figure of Vader.

A piece of machinery hits Luke and he is knocked out of the window.

INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT

Luke falls onto the gantry, rolls, and hangs over the edge, holding his
deactivated sword in hand.  He puts the sword on his belt and begins to
scramble up.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING PLATFORM

Leia, Lando, Chewie and the droids come round a corner and head for the
door to the landing platform.  They glimpse the Millennium Falcon for a
moment before the door slams shut.  The group ducks into an alcove as
stormtroopers arrive at the end of the corridor.  The troopers send a
rain of laser bolts at the group.  Chewie returns their fire as Lando
punches desperately at the door's control panel.

LANDO
The security codes has been changed!

THREEPIO
Artoo, you can tell the computer
to override the security system.

Threepio points to a computer socket on the control panel.  Artoo beeps
and scoots toward it.  Lando meanwhile has connected up to the panel's
intercom.

LANDO
Attention!  This is Lando
Calrissian.  The Empire has takes
control of the city.  I advise
everyone to leave before more
Imperial troops arrive.

Artoo takes off a computer cover and sticks his computer arm into the
socket.  Suddenly, a short beep turns into a wild scream.  Artoo's
circuits light up, his head spins wildly, and smoke begins to seep out
underneath him.  Quickly, Chewie pulls him away.

LANDO
This way.

Lando, Leia, Artoo, and Chewie flee down the corridor.  As he scoots
along with them, Artoo sends some angry beeps Threepio's way.

THREEPIO
Don't blame me.  I'm an interpreter.
I'm not supposed to know a power
socket from a computer terminal.

INT. CLOUD CITY - CORRIDOR

In a panic, Cloud City residents are trying to get out of the city.
Some carry boxes, others packages.  They run, then change direction.
Some are shooting at stormtroopers, others simply try to hide.

Other stormtroopers pursue Lando, Leia, and Chewie who are firing back
at them.  Artoo works on another door to the landing platform while
Threepio berates him for his seeming ineptitude.

THREEPIO
What are you talking about?  We're
not interested in the hyperdrive
on the Millennium Falcon.  It's
fixed!  Just open the door, you
stupid lump.

Chewie, Leia, and Lando retreat along the corridor.  A triumphant beep
from Artoo - and the door snaps open.

THREEPIO
(to Artoo)
I never doubted you for a second.
Wonderful!

Artoo lays a cloud fog, obscuring everything, as the group dashes
outside.

EXT. LANDING PLATFORM - CLOUD CITY - DUSK

They race for the Millennium Falcon as a battalion of stormtroopers
reaches the main door.  Lando and Leia hold off the troops as the
droids get on board with Chewie.  As Chewie bounds to the ship the
Threepio on his back, Threepio hits his head on the top of the ramp.

THREEPIO
Ouch!  Oh!  Ah!  That hurt.  Bend
down, you thoughtless... Ow!

Chewie starts up the ship.  The giant engines begin to whine as Lando
and Leia race up the ramp under a hail of laser fire.

LANDO
Leia!  Go!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CORRIDOR

Artoo drags the partially assembled Threepio down the corridor of the
Falcon.

THREEPIO
I thought that hairy beast would
be the end of me.  Of course, I've
looked better.

Artoo beeps understandingly.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Chewie works the controls as Leia sits in Han's seat and Lando watches
over their shoulders.  As Chewie pulls back on the throttle, the ship
begins to move.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM - DUSK

The Millennium Falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight sky and roars
away from the city.  Troops fire after it and TIE fighters take off in
pursuit.

INT. GANTRY - OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM - REACTOR SHAFT

Luke moves along the railing and up to the control room.

Vader lunges at him and Luke immediately raises his lit sword to meet
Vader's.  Sparks fly as they duel, Vader gradually forcing Luke
backward toward the gantry.

VADER
You are beaten.  It is useless
to resist.  Don't let yourself
be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.

Luke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at Vader so
viciously that he nicks Vader on the shoulder.  The black armor sparks
and smokes and Vader seems to be hurt, but immediately recovers.

Luke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as Vader comes at
him, slashing at the young Jedi with his sword.  Luke makes a quick
move around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry.
Vader's sword comes slashing down, cutting the complex loose; it begins
to fall, then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward.

Luke glances at the instrument complex floating away.  At that instant,
Vader's sword comes down across Luke's right forearm, cutting off his
hand and sending his sword flying.  In great pain, Luke squeezes his
forearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its
extreme end.  Vader
follows.  The wind subsides.  Luke holds on.  There is nowhere else to
go.

VADER
There is no escape.  Don't make
me destroy you.  You do not yet
realize your importance.  You
have only begun to discover your
power.  Join me and I will complete
your training.  With our combined
strength, we can end this destructive
conflict and bring order to the
galaxy.

LUKE
I'll never join you!

VADER
If you only knew the power of the
dark side.  Obi-Wan never told
you what happened to your father.

LUKE
He told me enough!  It was you
who killed him.

VADER
No.  I am your father.

Shocked, Luke looks at Vader in utter disbelief.

LUKE
No.  No.  That's not true!
That's impossible!

VADER
Search your feelings.  You know
it to be true.

LUKE
No!  No!  No!

VADER
Luke.  You can destroy the Emperor.
He has foreseen this.  It is your
destiny.  Join me, and together
we can rule the galaxy as father
and son.  Come with me.  It is the
only way.

Vader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to Luke.

A calm comes over Luke, and he makes a decision.  In the next instant
he steps off the gantry platform into space.  The Dark Lord looks over
the platform and sees Luke falling far below.  The wind begins to blow
at Vader's cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from the
edge.  The wind soon fades and the wounded Jedi begins to drop fast,
unable to grab onto anything to break his fall.

INT. REACTOR SHAFT

Suddenly Luke is sucked into an exhaust pipe in the side of the shaft.
When Vader sees this, he turns and hurries off the platform.

INT. EXHAUST PIPE

Luke tumbles through the exhaust pipe.

He slides to the end of the slickly polished pipe and stops as his feet
hit a circular grill and knock it open.  Luke claws at the surface of
the pipe, trying to keep from sliding out into space.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE - DUSK

Unable to hang onto the pipe, Luke tumbles out, emerging at the
undermost part of Cloud City.  Reaching out desperately, he manages to
grab onto on electronic weather vane.

LUKE
Ben... Ben, please!

Luke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips back down.
He hooks one of his legs around the fragile instruments.  All the
while, a powerful current of air rushes out at him from the exhaust
pipe.

LUKE
Ben.  Leia!

There is an ominous cracking sound from the base of the
weather vane and a piece breaks off, falling into the clouds far below.

LUKE
Hear me!  Leia!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Leia seems to be lost in a fog, her expression troubled.  Chewie is
busy operating the ship.  Lando stands next to the Wookiee, watching a
readout on the control panel.

LEIA
Luke... We've got to go back.

Chewie growls in surprise.

LANDO
What?

LEIA
I know where Luke is.

LANDO
But what about those fighter?

Chewie barks in agreement with Lando.

LEIA
Chewie, just do it.

LANDO
But what about Vader?

Chewie turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.

LANDO
All right, all right, all right.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - MILLENNIUM FALCON - DUSK

The Falcon makes a graceful banking turn back toward Cloud City.

EXT. CLOUD CITY - LANDING PLATFORM

Vader enters the landing platform and watches as the speck that is the
Falcon disappears.  The wind blows at his cape.

He turns to two aides who are standing near the entrance to the landing
platform.

VADER
Bring my shuttle.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE

Nearly unconscious, Luke hangs upside-down on the weather vane as his
body shifts in the wind.

EXT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

The Falcon dives to the underside of the floating city.  Three TIE
fighter close in on the starship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

Leia tries to remain calm.

LANDO
(pointing out the
cockpit window)
Look, someone's up there.

LEIA
It's Luke.  Chewie, slow down.
Slow down and we'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.

Lando rushes out of the cockpit.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY - WEATHER VANE

Luke hangs by one arm from the crossbar of the weather vane.  He slips
from the bar and grabs onto the pole of the vane as the Falcon banks
toward him.  The Falcon positions itself under Luke as Lando moves up
through the opening of the hatch.  Luke begins to slide and finally
falls from the vane into space.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Out the cockpit window, Leia sees Luke falling from the bottom of the
city.  The ship gains on him.

LEIA
Okay.  Easy, Chewie.

The Falcon closes in on Luke.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

Three TIE fighters race toward the Falcon, firing away.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HATCH

The hatch pops open with a hiss of pressure.  Lando reaches out to help
the battered warrior inside the ship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Flak bursts all around it as the Falcon banks away from the city.  Leia
and Chewie struggle with the controls.

LEIA
(into intercom)
Lando?

LANDO
(over intercom)
Okay, let's go.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

The Falcon races away.  It is closely followed by three TIE fighters,
all of which keep up a heavy laser assault on the fleeing starship.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Explosions erupt all around the cockpit, buffeting the ship wildly.
Chewie howls as he frantically tries to control the ship.

Leia and Chewie turns to see Luke, bloody and battered, enter the
cockpit supported by Lando.  Leia jumps up and hugs him while Chewie
barks in joyous relief.

LUKE
Oh, Leia.

LANDO
All right, Chewie.  Let's go.

Leia helps Luke from the cockpit as another huge blast rocks the ship.

EXT. SPACE - CLOUD CITY - DAY

The Falcon, still followed by the three TIE fighters, races away from
the cloud-covered city.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS

Luke rests on a cot, his injured arm wrapped in a protective cuff.
Leia gently wipes his face.  The ship lurches again.

LEIA
I'll be back.

She kisses him, then leaves the quarters.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

All over the ship muted alarm buzzers sound.  Lando anxiously watches
the flashing lights on the control panel and hurriedly adjusts some
switches.  Seated next to him, Chewie points out a new blip appearing
on the panel.  Leia, watching over their shoulders, recognizes the
shape.

LEIA
Star Destroyer.

LANDO
All right, Chewie.  Ready for
light-speed.

LEIA
If your people fixed the
hyperdrive.

Another explosion rocks the ship.  Leia notices as a green light on the
panel next to her flashes on.

LEIA
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

Chewie barks in agreement.

LANDO
Punch it!

The Wookiee shrugs and pulls back on the light-speed throttle.  The
sound of the ion engine changes...it is winding up.  Faces are tense,
expectant.  But nothing happens, and the engine goes off.  Chewie lets
out a frustrated howl.  The flak still violently rocks the ship.

LANDO
They told me they fixed it.  I
trusted them to fix it.  It's not
my fault!

Chewie gets up from his chair and starts out of the cockpit.  He gives
Lando and angry shove as he storms past him.

EXT. SPACE

In the distance the TIE fighters continue their chase, still shooting
lasers.  Vader's Star Destroyer moves behind them, determinedly
following the Falcon.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Vader stands on the bridge looking out the window as Admiral Piett
approaches him.

PIETT
They'll be in range of our
tractor beam in moments, my lord.

VADER
Did your men deactivate the
hyperdrive on the Millennium
Falcon?

PIETT
Yes, my lord.

VADER
Good.  Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for stun.

PIETT
Yes, my lord.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON

Beeping while he works, Artoo is busy connecting some wires to Threepio
who now has one leg attached.

Chewie enters through the doorway, grunting to himself.

THREEPIO
Noisy brute.  Why don't we just
go into light-speed?

Artoo beeps in response.

THREEPIO
We can't?  How would you know the
hyperdrive is deactivated?

Artoo whistles knowingly.

THREEPIO
The city's central computer told
you?  Artoo-Detoo, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.
Ouch!  Pay attention to what
you're doing!

Chewie is in the pit.  He is trying to loosen something with an
enormous wrench.  Frustrated, he uses the wrench like a club and hits
the panel...

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Leia and Lando, seated in front of the control panel, are suddenly
sprayed by a shower of sparks.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Vader stands on the bridge, watching as the Millennium Falcon is chased
by the TIE fighters.  As his Destroyer draws nearer, Vader's breathing
gets slightly faster.

VADER
Luke.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS

Luke realizes that Vader's ship is very near.  He feels resigned to his
fate.  He senses that he is beaten, more emotionally than physically.

LUKE
Father.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

VADER
Son, come with me.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - SLEEPING QUARTERS

LUKE
(moaning)
Ben, why didn't you tell me?

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando and Leia are at the controls of the Falcon.  Meanwhile, in the
ship's hold, Chewie continues to work frantically on the hyperdrive
mechanism.

LANDO
(into intercom)
Chewie!

EXT. SPACE

The Falcon races through space followed very closely by the TIE
fighters and the huge Imperial Star Destroyer.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Luke enters the cockpit and looks out the window.  He is almost
unconscious with pain and depression.

LUKE
It's Vader.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

VADER
Luke... it is your destiny.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

LUKE
Ben, why didn't you tell me?

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

PIETT
Alert all commands.  Ready for
the tractor beam.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD

Artoo races to a control panel and starts working on a circuit board.
Furious, Threepio stands on one leg, yelling.

THREEPIO
Artoo, come back at once!  You
haven't finished with me yet!
You don't know how to fix the
hyperdrive.  Chewbacca can do
it.  I'm standing here in pieces,
and you're having delusions of
grandeur!

Artoo moves a circuit on a control panel.  Suddenly, the control panel
lights up.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Leia and Lando are thrown into their seats as the Millennium Falcon
unexpectedly shoot into hyperspace.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - HOLD

The ship tilts up and Artoo topples into the pit on top of Chewie.

THREEPIO
Oh, you did it!

EXT. SPACE

The Falcon soars into infinity and away from the huge Star Destroyer
which seems, by contrast, to stand still.

INT. VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Admiral Piett and another captain glance at Vader in terror.  Vader
turns slowly and walks off the bridge, his hands held behind his back
in a contemplative gesture.

EXT. SPACE - REBEL CRUISER

The Millennium Falcon is attached to a huge Rebel cruiser by a docking
tube.  Rebel fighters move about the giant cruiser, and a Rebel
transport ship hovers near the fleet.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando sits in the pilot's seat as he talks into the comlink.  Chewie
busily throws a variety of switches in preparation for takeoff.

LANDO
(into comlink)
Luke, we're ready for takeoff.

LUKE
(over comlink)
Good luck, Lando

LANDO
(into comlink)
When we find Jabba the Hut and
that bounty hunter, we'll contact
you.

INT. STAR CRUISER - MEDICAL CENTER

Luke speaking into the comlink as a medical droid works on his hand.
Leia stands near him while Threepio and Artoo look out the window.

LUKE
(into comlink)
I'll meet you at the rendezvous
point on Tatooine.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

LANDO
(into comlink)
Princess, we'll find Han.  I
promise.

INT. STAR CRUISER - MEDICAL CENTER

LUKE
(into comlink)
Chewie, I'll be waiting for your
signal.

Chewie's wail comes over the comlink.

LUKE
(into comlink)
Take care, you two.  May the
Force be with you.

Luke looks down at his hand.  A metalized type of bandage has been
wrapped around his wrist.  The medical droid makes some adjustments in
a tiny electronic unit, then pricks each one of Luke's fingers.

LUKE
Ow!

Luke wriggles his fingers, makes a fist, and relaxes it.  His hand is
completely functional.

He gets up and walks over to Leia.  There is a new bond between them, a
new understanding.  Leia is thinking about Han; Luke is thinking about
his uncertain and newly complicated future.  Together they stand at the
large window of the medical center looking out on the Rebel Star
Cruiser and a dense, luminous galaxy swirling in space.

Luke puts his arm around Leia.  The droids stand next to them, and
Threepio moves closer to Artoo putting his arm on him.  The group
watches as the Millennium Falcon moves into view, makes a turn, and
zooms away into space.

EXT. SPACE - REBEL STAR CRUISER

While Luke, Leia, and the droids stand, looking out the window of the
star cruiser, two escort fighters join the large ship.  Slowly, the
cruiser turns and moves away into space.

EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - BROILING HOT DAY

As the film's OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE plays, complete with its own
SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME SONG, we see SEVEN shirtless and shoeless
BLACK MALE SLAVES connected together with LEG IRONS, being run,
by TWO: WHITE MALE HILLBILLIES on HORSEBACK.

The location is somewhere in Texas. The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID,
BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just
recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville
Mississippi. The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called,
The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY).

One of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO... . he's fourth in the leg
iron line. We may or may not notice a tiny small "r" burned into his
cheek ("r" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back which
has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings.

As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a MONTAGE of misery
and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering
sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. Bare feet
step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. Leg Irons take the
skin off ankles.

AS The CREDITS play, DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK.
Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually the
time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most
painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters
from his past. In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at the
Greenville Auction.

DJANGO
Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the
cell door, his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block.

He fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance,
he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he
hears the Auctioneer yell; "Sold." Then she's taken away to whereabouts
unknown, never to be seen again.

As the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers;

DJANGO in the SLAVE PEN
with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed
for forty.

WHITE MEN yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him
down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area
circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the
structure.

The ground floor is covered by the BIG MONEY BUYERS who stand in front
of the auction block.









2

DJANGO
is moved into a line of SLAVES (The Black Men), and their MASTERS
(their White Owners), and their SELLERS (the White Man actually doing
the sales pitch on the auction block), as they wait for their turn on
the block.
A SLAVE (ROBBIE), stand on the auction block in view of the room full
of Buyers, The SELLER sells, and the OWNERS stand off to the side.

DJANGO
takes in the environment around him. Django has never cared for white
folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly.

It's DJANGO's turn ON THE AUCTION BLOCK
as the THEME SONG wails its tragic crescendo, Django is brought up on
the auction block. He.looks down at all the WHITE PEOPLE who want to
buy Niggers, who look up to him.
His heart fills with poison.

BACK TO DJANGO
walking in Leg Irons with his six Other Companions, walking across the
blistering Texas panhandle... .remembering.. .thinking. - .hating.

THE OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE
end.


 --" EXT - WOODS -- NIGHT

It's night time and The Speck Brothers, astride HORSES, keep pushing
their black skinned cargo forward.
It's a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the.sky to
create a little top light. It's so dark, the Slavers use the creek.bed
to keep from getting lost. Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up on
their horse, as. does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the chain gang.
It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves,
two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. In fact the
seven chained together Slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and
all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in unison,
resemble a human locomotive.
The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both Speck
Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white
fur collars.

WHEN...
.A SOUND and a SMALL LIGHT appears ahead of them on the road. This
makes the Slave Traders stop their human live stock, and ready their
rifles for possible trouble.

A BLACK HORSE
carrying a dressed in grey Rider, CLIP-CLOPS from the background to the
foreground, illuminated by a glowing lantern that the Rider carries.

THE RIDER
appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. A long grey
winter'coat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey bowler
hat on his head.

DICKY SPECK
Who's that stumblin around in the dark?
State your business, or prepare to get
winged!

THE RIDER
Calm yourselves gentlemen, I mean you no
harm. I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front
of the two Slavers, and their Slaves, lifting the lantern up to his
face. He speaks with a slight German accent.

THE RIDER
(to the Slavers)
Good cold evening gentlemen.
(to the shivering Slaves)
Good evening-I'm looking for a pair of
slave traders that go by the'name of
The Speck Brothers. Might that be you?

ACE SPECK
Who wants to. know?

THE RIDER
I do. I'm Dr. King Schultz, and this
is my horse, Fritz.
Fritz, does a little bow with his head, a neat trick the doctor taught
him.

DICKY SPECK
You a doctor?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Affirmative.

DICKY SPECK
What kinda doctor?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Dentist. Are you The Speck Brothers, and did you
purchase those men at The Greenville.Slave Auction?

ACE SPECK
So what?









LE
Dr.SCHULTZ
So, I wish to parley with you.

ACE SPECK
Speak English!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, it is a
second language. Amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe, is a specimen
I'm keen to acquire.
(to the slaves)
Hello you poor devils. Is there one among
you, who was formerly a resident of
The Carrucan Plantation?
Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second
half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. In the darkness a
VOICE rings out;

DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.
Dr.Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his
lantern, illuminating our hero Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid! And what's your name young, man?

DJANGO
Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Wunderbar! You're exactly the one I'm looking
for. So tell me Django - by the way that's a
amazing name - during your time at the
Carrucan Plantation, did you come to know
three overseers by the name of The Brittle
Brothers?
Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.Schultz is delighted.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Big John, Ellis, and little brother Raj?

DJANGO
Dem da Brittle Brothers.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So Django, do you think you could recognize -
   . The Speck Brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their
Slave in polite conversation.. .with a touch of disbelief.









ACE SPECK
Hey, stop talkin' to him like that!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like what?

ACE SPEC
Like that!
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain

ACE SPECK
Speak English, goddamit!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Everybody calm down! I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.

ACE SPECK
I don't care, no sale. Now off wit ya!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Don't be ridiculous, of course they're for
sale.
Ace raises his rifle towards the German.

ACE SPECK
Move it!
Ace cocks back the rifle hammer.
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good man, did you simply get carried away
with your dramatic gesture, or are you
pointing that weapon at me with lethal
intention...?

ACE SPECK
Last chance, fancy pants
Dr.SCHULTZ
- Very well -
The doctor, throws his lantern to the ground, enveloping him in
darkness.
The next FLASH OF LIGHT we see is the good doctors PISTOL out of his
holster, and FIRING point blank into Ace Specks face...
.BLOWING the dumber dumb brother off his horse, dead in the dirt.








Before Dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the Germans
direction...

BAM...
Dr.SCHULTZ SHOOTS his HORSE in the head...
.The Steed goes down taking Dicky with him...
When the dead weight horse lands on Dicky's slightly twisted leg, we
hear TWO DISTINCT CRACKING SOUNDS.:..
Dicky lets out a bitch like scream.
The Slaves watch all this. They've never seen a white man kill another
white man before.
Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint.
Django watches in the dark, the German climb down off his horse,
pick up Ace's discarded lantern, and walk over to the remaining Speck.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Sorry about putting a bullet in your beast.
But I didn't want you to do anything rash
before you had a moment to come to your senses.
Dr.Sch.ultz LIGHTS the lantern, illuminating himself, as he stands over
Dicky's body.

DICKY SPECK
You goddamn son of a bitch, you killed Ace!
Dr.SCHULTZ.
I only shot your brother, once he threatened
to shoot me. And I do believe I have ...

(COUNTING OUT

THE SLAVES)
.one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven witnesses who can attest to that fact.

DICKY SPECK
My damn legs busted!
Dr.SCHULTZ
No doubt. Now, if you can keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like
to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.

(TO DJANGO)
As I was saying, if you were to see
the Brittle Brothers again, would you
recognize them?

DJANGO
Yes.








Dr.SCHULTZ
Now I'm sure. to you, all unshaven white men
look alike. So Django, in a crowd of
unshaven white men, can you honestly
and positively point out The Brittle Brothers?

DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
We're in his little shack at the Carrucan Plantation. It's PISSING RAIN
outside. Django is making love to his wife Broomhilda, when she stops
letting out a shout. The three overseers known as THE BRITTLE BROTHERS
are outside peeking in through the window. They BURST in through the
front door. Soaked to the bone, they rodeo bull their way into the
shack, and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement.
As Django and Broomhilda are forced to copulate, they run their wet
white hands down her chocolate leg.. .they fondle his ass.. .they squeeze
her tit. . .they bring a belt across Django's backside to make him fuck
faster. . .then they yank him off, as BIG JOHN climbs on top of
Broomhilda..the other Brittle brothers whip Django with their belts,
and make him sit in the corner, while they finish with his wife.

BACK TO DJANGO

DJANGO
I can point 'em out.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Sold American! So Mr.Speck, how much for
Django?

DICKY SPECK
I'm gonna lose this leg!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, unless you find a talented physician
very quickly, I'm afraid that will be the.
end result. But back to business, how much
do you want for Django?

DICKY SPECK
You go to hell!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Don't be silly. How much for Django?

DICKY SPECK
800 dollars!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh come now, I may not have the experience in
the slave trade that you and your family does,
but neither was I born yesterday.









8
The. good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket.
Dr.SCHULTZ
In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked
up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says
that the going rate for African flesh'
- in particularly a field nigger - is sixty
to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as
Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger.
Which according to"this pamphlet here - and
why would they lie - puts his price at
eighty dollars. So in light of that, how
bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for
young Django here.
Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a
one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And since your late brother. won't be using
it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.
He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on
Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money-.in the saddle bags
on Dicky's dead horse. With.his hands in there, he roots around and
finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons.
Django is free.
Dr.SCHULTZ
There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good
rubbing, then get up on that horse.
Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter
coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket
over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.
Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a
bill of sale. Do you have one?
Dicky just curses him.
He says, removing a notebook from his pocket;
Dr.SCHULTZ
I thought not. No worries, I come prepared.
(as he writes)
This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
(he stops, then
says to Django)
Django is spelled with a silent "D",
is it not?









9

DJANGO
Huh?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Why not..
He writes it in his book with a silent "D", then stops to admire the
way it looks.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, that does add a little character.
The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down
under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen.
Dr.SCHULTZ
If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your
mark here.
The. Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good doctor
wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket knife.
And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear.
He signs the bill of sale.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a
pleasure doing business with you, but your
customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in
leg irons.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Now as to you poor devils.
He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject
of what to do next, you gentlemen have two
choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that
beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him
to the nearest town. Which would be at least
thirty-seven miles back the way you came.
Or ...
.Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that
rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep, and make your way
to a more enlightened area of the country.
The choice is yours.
He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds;









0
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, and on the off chance that there's
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,
the North Star is THAT ONE. Tata.
He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Just give him a little kick.
Django does, and the horse responds by moving.
Dr.SCHULTZ
See, it's not so difficult.

EXT - MORNING TEXAS LANDSCAPE - SUNRISE
The DAWN BREAKS on a western landscape. The two men ride their horses
silently, horse hooves CLIP-CLOPPING among the rocks. Django wears
Specks winter coat, with one of Dr.Schultz's white button down dress
shirts underneath it. As they ride through the picturesque scene...
Dr.Schultz breaks the silence.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So, Django, what do you intend to name him?

DJANGO
Who?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Your horse?

DJANGO
What horse?
Dr.SCHULTZ'
The horse you're riding.

DJANGO
This ain't my horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes it is.

DJANGO
No it ain't, it's your horse. I'm just riding
it.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute -
technically not. If it's my horse, I can
give it to you, and as of now, I'm doing such.
Django, you're now the proud owner of a horse,
congratulations.









 1

DJANGO
I can't feed no horse. I can't put no horse
up in no stable.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(FRUSTRATED)
Don't worry about all that!
They ride a bit longer in silence.. .the good doctor composes himself...
then says with a smile;
Dr.SCHULTZ
So... . now that that's settled... . what do you
intend to name it? Half the fun of having
a horse is choosing his name. For instance
my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn,
ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I
couldn't do without him.
(he pats Fritz's neck)
Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't
something one does lightly. So once you've
thought about it for awhile -

DJANGO
- Tony.
Dr.SCHULTZ
- Tony what?

DJANGO
- I dunno, Tony the horse.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, you mean you want to name your horse
Tony?

DJANGO
Yeah. That's what you jus' asked me, right?
Dr.SCHULTZ
When you're right you're right, indeed I did.
Why Tony?

DJANGO
I gotta tell ya? You didn't tell me I gotta
tell ya.
As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a
western town. They pass by a sign that says; "WELCOME TO DAUGHTREY,

TEXAS"









 Z
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well I'm naturally curious, of course, but
there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact
an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to
any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it
well. Good job Django, well done.

EXT - THE WESTERN TOWN OF DAUGHTREY - MORNING
As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up, Django and Dr.Schultz ride Fritz
and Tony through the main street of town..Daughtrey looks like a
million western towns we've seen before in movies. But to the
TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey, Django and the German don't look like a
million other visitors.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What's everybody staring at?

DJANGO
They never seen a nigger on a horse before.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What's this bizarre obsession they have
with. you not riding horses?

DJANGO
You askin' me?
Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. Django has
a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him, but it gets
done. Dr.Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So what other archaic rituals are you people
verboten to take part in?
As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; "What"?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what
you can do, and what you can't do, and if
you can't do it, why can't you do it?
Like for instance, what if we were to walk
in this saloon here, sit down at a table,
order a drink, and drink it?
Would the authorities frown on that?

DJANGO
Hell yeah, they gonna frown.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What part would they find the most offensive?









13

DJANGO
All of it. I can't be walkin' in no saloon.
I can't be sittin' my ass on no chair,
at no table. I can't be drinkin' no drink.
And I definitely can't be sharin' no drink,
with no white man, in public.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So if you and I did those things, that would
be considered enough of a infraction to make
the saloon keeper go get the sheriff?

DJANGO
You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff.
The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well in that case Django, after you.

DJANGO
Whoa - I ain't funnin, I can't go in there.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django you're going to have to learn to trust
me, and as the man said; "There's no time
like the,present."
He takes Django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the
establishment.

INT - SALOON - MORNING
The nervous black slave and the confident German'dentist walk into the
saloon.
The SALOON KEEPER (PETE) is high up on a chair placed high up on a
table, to change a candle in the saloons chandelier. His back is turned
away from the two patrons.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good morning inn keeper, two beers for two
weary travelers.

SALOON KEEPER
It',s still pretty early, we won't be open
for about a hour. But by then we'll be
servin' breakfast -
He turns around and sees them.

SALOON KEEPER
Whoa! What the hell you think you doin' boy,
get that nigger outta here.









IT

TIME CUT

EXT - SALOON - MORNING
It's about five minutes later, and the Saloon Keeper comes running out
of the bar to get the Sheriff.
When Dr.Schultz, sitting at a table with the young Django, calls;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Inn keeper! Remember, get the sheriff, not
the marshall. This wouldn't be the marshalls
jurisdiction.'This is just a infraction,
on what I assume is a simple county ordinance,
and that would fall under the domain of the
Sheriff.
The Saloon Keeper runs away.
The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon.
Dr.SCHULTZ
It looks like we must act as our own bartender.
The German stands up, and walks-behind the bar, and pours two beer's
from the tap into mugs. Django remains seated, and after a beat, asks;

DJANGO
What kinda dentist are you?
This makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beer's.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I haven't practiced dentistry in five years -
Not to say once I know you better, I wouldn't
like to get a look at that mouth - I'm sure
it's a disaster - But these days I practice
a new profession ... . Bounty Hunter.
This gets no reaction from Django.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is?
The Black Man shakes his head, no.
As the good doctor, walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer,

HE EXPLAINS;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well the way the slave trade deals in
human lives for cash, a bounty hunter,
deals in corpses.









15
Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
The state places a bounty on a man's head.
I track that man, I find that man, I kill
that man. After I've killed him, I transport
that man's corpse back to the authorities -
and sometimes that's easier said then done.
I show that corpse to the authorities -
proving, yes indeed, I have truly killed him
- At which point, the authorities pay me
the bounty.
(lifting his beer)
Cheers.
The two men touch glasses, and take a drink.

DJANGO
What's a bounty?
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's like a reward.

DJANGO
You kill people and they give you a reward?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Certain people, yes.

DJANGO
White people?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mostly. A few Mexicans. Couple Chinamen.

DJANGO
Bad people?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Badder they are, bigger the reward.
Which brings me to you, and I must admit
I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes
to you. On one hand, I despise slavery.
On the other hand, I need your help,
and if you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better. So for the time being,
I'm going to make this slave malarkey
work to my benefit.

(BEAT)
Still... . having said that, .I feel guilty.
So... I'd like the two of us to enter into
an agreement. I'm looking for The Brittle Brothers,
however in this endeavor I'm at a slight
disadvantage, in so far as, I don't know
what they look like. But you do... .dont'cha?

   . DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
Django, back at The Carrucan Plantation, held down by Roger and Ellis
Brittle, as Big John BURNS the "r" into his cheek with a BRANDING IRON.

BACK TO DJANGO

DJANGO
I know what they look like, all right.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good. So, here's my agreement. You travel
with me till we find them -

DJANGO
- Where we goin'?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I hear at least two of them are overseeing
up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
That means we visit every plantation in
Gatlinburg till we find them. And when we
find them, you point them out, and I kill
them. You do that, I agree to give you
your freedom... . twenty-five dollars per
Brittle brother - that's seventy-five
dollars... . your horse, Tony even though
I've already gave him to you -- but once the
final Brittle brother lies dead in the
dust, I'll buy you a new saddle, and a
new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat
included.
Dr.Schultz's eyes go to the saloon window.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff.

EXT - SALOON - MORNING
We see the sheriff, BILL SHARP, walk towards the saloon cradling a
Winchester. Some TOWNSPEOPLE (like the Saloon Keeper) stand around to
watch. A. YOUNG BOY leads a herd of BABY GOATS through town.
Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street.

SHERIFF SHARP
Okay boys, fun's over, come on out.
Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch.
As they do, The Sheriff says;









1 2

SHERIFF SHARP
Now why y'all wanna come into my town,
start trouble, and scare all these nice
people? You ain't got nothin' better to
do, then to come into Bill Sharps town
and show your ass -
From his top step on the porch, Dr. King Schultz extends his hand
toward the sheriff, as if to shake it... :.

.THEN...
A SMALL DERRINGER - POPS into Schultz's hand from a metal sliding
apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve. Once in hand, the dentist
FIRES one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp.
The tiny gun makes a tiny POP sound.
The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in the
dirt.
The TOWNSPEOPLE are startled.
As is Django.
As Schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading
his tiny pop shooter, a PEDESTRIAN yells out;

PEDESTRIAN
What did you jus' do to our sheriff?
Dr.Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law man's
skull, killing him dead.
In the background, ONE WOMAN faints. The Boy and his Goats scatter.
Dr.Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper, across the street.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Now you can go get the marshall.

TIME CUT

EXT - DAUGHTREY MAIN STREET - DAY
U.S.MARSHALL GILL TATUM snaps the MENFOLK OF Daughtrey to attention.

MARSHALL TATUM
Move that buckboard over there long ways
across the street from the saloon. And I
want six men and six Winchesters behind it.
And I want two men with two rifles on this
roof, and two men with two rifles on that
roof, with all barrels pointed at that
front door. And somebody git poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.









LP
Cowboys with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof of the
building across the street from the saloon.
The Marshall directs the buckboard being moved into place.
The last SNIPER on the rooftop takes his position.

WHEN...

COMING FROM THE SALOON... . PIANO MUSIC ...

INT - SALOON - DAY
Dr.Schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon number.
He seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano
player. A terrified Django, who's sure his new master is a lunatic
who's going to get them both killed, peeks out the closed curtains
on the window.
Dr.Schultz's suit coat sits draped over a chair. All of his weapons,
including his metal sliding rail Derringer contraption, lie on a table.
He plays piano in his button down dress shirt and gray suit vest.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What are they doing?

DJANGO
I think they wonderin' why you playin'
the piana'.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good.

(PAUSE)
But what are they doing?

DJANGO
A buncha white folks brought a buckboard
around out front, now they hidin' behind it
with guns. And a buncha other white folks
are up on the roof, with rifles pointed
down here.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Damn, they got that organized fast. Is the
marshall out there?

DJANGO
If the one I think is the.marshall is the
marshall, he's out there.









)9
Dr.SCHULTZ
What makes you think he's the marshall?

DJANGO
Cause he's the one ready to say somethin'.

MARSHALL'S VOICE
You in the saloon!
Dr.Schultz stops playing the piano.

MARSHALL'S VOICE
We got eleven Winchesters on every way
outta that buildin'! You got once chance
git outta this alive! You and your nigger
come out right now with your hands over
your head, and I mean, right now!
Dr.SCHULTZ
First things first! Is this the marshall
I have the pleasure of addressing?

MARSHALL TATUM
Yes it is, this is U.S. Marshall Gill Tatum.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Wunderbar! So marshall, I have relieved
myself of all weapons, and just as you
have instructed, I'm ready to step outside
with my hands raised above my head.
I trust as a representative of the
criminal justice system of The United
States of America, I shant be shot down
in the street, by either you or your deputies,
before I've had my day in court.

MARSHALL TATUM
You mean like you did our sheriff? Shot
'em down like a dog in the street!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, that's exactly what I mean! Do I
have your word as a lawman not to shoot
me down like a dog in the street?

MARSHALL TATUM
Well, as much as we'd all enjoy seein'
somethin' like that, ain't nobody gonna
cheat the hangman in my town!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Fair enough marshall, here we.come.!








Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO DJANGO)
They're a little tense out there. So don't
make any quick movements, and let me do
the talking.
Django looks at him like, "as if..."

EXT - SALOON MAIN STREET - DAY
A lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon.
Outside of range, the WHOLE TOWN watches the stand off.
The saloon doors open, and Dr.Schultz and Django, hands raised, step
outside.

MARSHALL TATUM
You unarmed?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes indeed we are. Marshall Tatum, may I
address you, your deputies, and apparently
the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the
incident that just occurred?

MARSHALL TATUM
Go on!
Dr.SCHULTZ
My name is Dr.King Schultz. And like
yourself, marshall, I am a servant of the
court. The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit
to elect as their sheriff, who went by
the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a
wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,
with a price on his head of two hundred
dollars. That's two hundred dollars, dead
or alive.

MARSHALL TATUM
The hell you say!
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'.m aware this is probably disconcerting
news. But I'm willing to wager this man
was elected sheriff sometime in the last
two years. I know this because. three years
ago he was rustling cattle from,
The B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company of
Lubbock Texas.









Z 
Dr.SCHULTZ (CONT'D)
In my possession. is a warrant made out by
circuit court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk
of Austin Texas. You are encouraged to wire him.
He will back up who I am, and who your
dear departed sheriff was.
The Menfolk of the town with rifles, begin trading looks. Then
Dr.Schultz delivers the coup de grace.
Dr.SCHULTZ
In other words marshall, you owe me
two hundred dollars.

CUT TO

EXT - TENNESSEE COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
Django and Dr.Schultz, who by now have ridden quite a few miles
together, ride their horses in the Tennessee countryside, on the way to
Gatlinburg. Dr.Schultz is dressed in one of his nearly identical grey
business suits, and Django is still dressed in his slave pants,
Schultz's button down dress shirt, and Ace Speck's winter coat.
Somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared on'his feet.
Dr.SCHULTZ
One needs a plan, son. These are brutal
times. A man who survives, is a man with
a plan. A man who thrives, is a man with
a good plan. So, having said that, what's
your plan, young Django?

DJANGO
What'cha mean?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, after this Brittle business is behind
us, you'll be a free man, with a horse, and
seventy five dollars in your back pocket.
What's your plan after that?

DJANGO
Find my wife, and buy her freedom.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django, I had no idea you were a married man.
Do most slaves take the institution of
matrimony seriously?

DJANGO
Huh?









ZZ
Dr.SCHULTZ
Do slaves believe in marriage'?

DJANGO
Me and my wife do.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Where is she now?

DJANGO
I dunno. They put us in different boxcars,
and sent U.S to The Greenville Slave Auction.
She got sold two days 'fore me.
But I don't know who to.
Dr.Schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Care for some jerky?

DJANGO
Sure.
Dr.Schultz rips him off a piece. Django chews on it. As he chews,

SCHULTZ SAYS;
Dr.SCHULTZ
So your plan is to trackdowri your wife, and
purchase her.freedom? Only you don't know
where she is?
A chewing Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.Schultz, takes a big bite of jerky, chews for a "moment contemplating
the dilemma, then pronounces;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well that shouldn't be all that difficult.
So how long ago did all this happen?

DJANGO
A few months ago.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Three or four?

DJANGO
Three.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So shecamefrom the Carrucan Plantation,
and shewassold at The Greenville Slave
Auctiontosome :unknown customer three
monthsago?
Django nods his head, yes.









Z3
Dr.SCHULTZ
The bad part about slavery being a business,
is it's immoral. The good part about it being
a business is, they keep records. Somewhere
in Greenville there's a book with your wife's
name in it, and the name of the customer who
bought her, and more then likely their address.
But then Schultz seems to get second thoughts.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Still, seventy-five dollars in your back
pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but it's
not going to get you very far in Greenville.
Not to mention a slave auction town in
Mississippi isn't the safest place you could
visit. Free or not.

DJANGO
I'll have my freedom papers.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes you will. But say you show them to some
rascals, and they take them from you and
tear them up?

DJANGO
They could do that?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm not saying they would, but they could.

DJANGO
They do that I'll kill 'em.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Great! Now you get hung for killin' a white
man. The point being is the place,is just
too dangerous for you.

DJANGO
Well I gotta go, when do I go?
Dr.SCHULTZ
When you get more dangerous.

EXT - CHATTANOOGA - DAY
Muddy and wet big city Chattanooga. We're in the back of a STORE that.
sells SERVANT HOUSE NIGGER UNIFORMS. Django comes bursting out of the
stores back door. He's very distressed. One glance at the outfit he's
wearing explains the distress.









Z

DJANGO
is dressed in a powder blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, that
wouldn't be out of place in the court of Marie Antoinette at
Versailles.
Dr.Schultz comes trailing after him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django, you have to, it's part of "The Act".
You're playing a character. Your character
is The Valet. This is what The Valet wears.
Remember what I told you. During the act,
you can never break character.

CUT TO

EXT - BENNETT MANOR- DAY
We see Dr. Schultz, riding slightly in front of Django, dressed in his
blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the property of
BENNETT MANOR, a plantation in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Django leads a
riderless horse, behind him and Tony.
As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front
steps of Bennett Manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the SLAVES
stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare in
wonder at this sight.
The patriarch of Bennett Manor, SPENCER "BIG DADDY" BENNETT, dressed in
a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of the
mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the white
man and black man move from the background to the foreground.
While there are plenty BLACK MALES out in the cotton fields, the
majority of the slave population of Bennett Manor is pretty.BLACK
FEMALES, fourteen to twenty-four, referred to as, "PONY'S".
The biggest money making crop of this farm, after cotton.
As Dr.Schultz and fancy pants Django, bring Fritz and Tony to a stop
in front of Bennett Manor, they've drawn quite a crowd of SLAVES,
BENNETT FAMILY MEMBERS, and WHITE WORKERS (OVERSEER'S).
Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he won't be forced to look up
at the darkee on the horse.

SPENCER BENNETT
It's against the law for niggers to ride
horses in this territory.
Dr.SCHULTZ
This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk.

SPENCER BENNETT
I said niggers -








Z .ate 
Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Django, he's a free man, and
he can ride what he pleases.

SPENCER BENNETT
Not on my.property, around my niggers
he can't.
Dr.SCHULTZ
My good sir, perhaps we got off on the
wrong boot. Allow me to unring this bell.
My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my
valet, Django, and these are our horses,
Fritz, and Tony.
Fritz, does his head bow.
This makes the pretty PONY'S surrounding Bennett, giggle.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, I've been lead to believe you
are a gentleman, and a business man.
And it is in these capacities that we've
ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk
with you now.

SPENCER BENNETT
State your business.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I wish to purchase one of your
nigger gals.

SPENCER BENNETT
You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to
Tennessee, to buy one of my nigger gals,
no appointment, no nuttin'?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm afraid so.

SPENCER BENNETT
Well what if I say, I don't like you, or
your fancy pants. nigger, and I wouldn't
sell you a tinkers damn - what'cha gotta
say about that?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, if you are the business man,
I've been led to believe you to be,
I have five thousand things I might say,
that could change your mind.
i This gets everybody's attention, not least of all Spencer Bennett.
Spencer laughs.









ZG

SPENCER BENNETT
C'mon inside, get yourself something' cool
to drink.
The incognito bounty hunter, dismounts his steed, as does Django.
Then the good doctor walks up the steps to Bennett Manor.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Maybe while we discuss business, you
could provide one of your loveliest black
creatures to escort Django here around
your magnificent grounds.

SPENCER
Absolutely. Betina!
A pretty, fleshy, sweet jelled, twenty-two year old slave gal named
BETINA, snaps to attention.

BETINA
Yes sir, Big Daddy?

SPENCER

(TO SCHULTZ)
What's your Jimmies name again?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django.

SPENCER
Betina sugar, take Django around the
grounds. Show 'em all the pretty stuff.

BETINA
As you please, Big Daddy.
Dr.Schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr. Bennett, I must remind, you, Django is a
free man. He cannot be treated like a slave.
Within the bounds of good taste, he must be
treated as an extension of myself.

SPENCER
Understood., Schultz. Betina?

BETINA
Yes, sir?

SPENCER
Django isn't a slave. Django is a free
man. Do you understand? You're not to treat
him like any of these other niggers around
here, cause he ain't like any of these
other niggers around here. Ya got it?









BETINA
Ya want I should treat 'em like white
folks?

SPENCER
No that's not what I said.

BETINA
Then I don't know what'cha want Big Daddy.

SPENCER
Yes, I can see that.

(HE THINKS)
What's the name of that peckawood boy from
town works with the glass? His mama works
at the lumber yard? He comes by and fixes
the winda's when we have a problem?
The MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR chimes in;

MAMMY OF BENNETT MANOR
Oh, you mean Jerry.

SPENCER
Yeah, that's the boy's name, Jerry.

(TO BETINA)
You know Jerry, dont'cha sugar?

BETINA
Yes 'em, Big Daddy.

SPENCER
Well that's it then... just treat 'em
like you would Jerry.

EXT - ANOTHER PART OF BENNETT MANOR - DAY
Away from the big house, Betina gives Django a tour of the grounds.
Her in her slave get up, complete with handkerchief on her head, and
him in his satin baby blue Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, are quite
the pair. She eyeballs him disapprovingly up and down.

BETINA
What'cha do for your massa'?

DJANGO
Didn't you hear him tell ya, I ain't no slave.

BETINA
So you really free?

DJANGO
Yes.









ZY

BETINA
You mean you wanna dress like that?
Django fumes.

EXT - BENNETT MANOR (BACK PORCH) - DAY
Both Spencer Bennett and Dr.Schultz sit on the back porch drinking
lemonade.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I've been'told by those who should know,
the most exquisite African flesh in the
state of Tennessee is bred right here on
your land. And from the look of these
black angels, my sources weren't wrong.

SPENCER
Oh I got my share of, coal blacks, horse
faces, and gummy mouth bitches out in the
field. But the lion share of my lady
niggers are real show pony's.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well that's what I'm looking for, a show
pony for young Django. So the only
question that remains is, do you have a
nigger here worth five thousand dollars?

SPENCER
Dr.Schultz, five thousand dollar nigger,
is practically my middle name.

BACK TO DJANGO AND BETINA
Betina and Django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds.
The cotton fields and the SLAVES picking it, in the background.

DJANGO
Betina, come over here, I need to ask
you something.
He moves her by the tree for more privacy. Betina thinks this fancy
pants wants to get all lovey-dovey, and she couldn't be less interested.

BETINA
What'cho want?

DJANGO
I'm lookin' for three white men. Three
brothers. Overseers. Their name is
Brittle. Do you know 'em?

BETINA
Brittle?









DJANGO
Yes, Brittle. John Brittle. Ellis Brittle.
And Roger Brittle, sometimes called, Little Raj.

BETINA
I don't know dem.

DJANGO
They could be usin' a different name.
They woulda' come to the plantation in
the last year.

BETINA
You mean The Shaffer's?

DJANGO
Maybe? Three brother?

BETINA
Ah-huh.

DJANGO
Are they here?

BETINA
Ah-huh.

DJANGO
Can you point one of 'em out to me?

BETINA
Well ones over in that field.
She points to the cotton field, at a OVERSEER on top of a horse, whip
in hand, eyeing the blacks at his mercy.
Django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it, and
takes out a shiny brass SPYGLASS, the type a sea captain might use.
Obviously a prop from Dr.Schultz. He slides it open, places it against
his eye, and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton
field landscape.

SPYGLASS POV:
Astride his nag, the filthy hillbilly, who calls himself SHAFFER, but
who Django knows to be ELLIS BRITTLE, looks on, oblivious to Django's
observation.

DJANGO SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK
He remembers Ellis Brittle BURNING a "r" into Broomhilda's cheek with a

BRANDING IRON.

BACK TO DJANGO AND THE SPYGLASS
he lowers the glass.

BETINA

(INNOCENTLY)
Is that who you lookin' for?

DJANGO
Yep.
He folds the spyglass back up, and puts it back in his purse.

DJANGO
Where's the other two?

BETINA.
They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody
for breakin' eggs.

DJANGO
They whippin' Little Jody?
She nods her head, yes.

DJANGO
Point me in that direction.
She points to a shed, and keeps pointing right.

BETINA
You go to that shed, and keep goin' that way.
Which means; "Go to the shed and turn right."

DJANGO
Go git that white man, I came here with.
He slaps her ass, to hurry her up.
Then looks to the shed, and begins crossing the distance between him
and The Brittle Brothers.

FLASH ON
A memory from The Carrucan Plantation; The Brittle Brothers giving his
wife Broomhilda, a peelin'.
PEELIN' : A punishment by bullwhip, across the back.
LITTLE RAJ makes a line in the dirt with the heel of his boot.
Making Django stand behind it, as he watches his wife being whipped.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE SLASHES the beauty of Broomhilda's back with his

BULLWHIP.
DJANGO, keeping behind the line, begs Big John for mercy.

DJANGO
Please Big John, she won't do it no more!
She's real sorry!
The WHIP RIPS her back.

DJANGO

(SCREAMING)
Goddamit, Big John!

LITTLE RAJ
Whoa nigger, calm down, keep it funny.
Django gets on his knees, and on behalf of Broomhild.a, begs Big John
Brittle with everything he has.

BACK TO DJANGO
crossing the lawn towards The Brittle Brothers, like an express train.

FLASH ON
Big John Brittle standing over him, bullwhip in hand, saying to the

KNEELING DJANGO;

BIG JOHN BRITTLE
I like the way you beg, boy.

EXT - STABLE - DAY
Little Raj Brittle, ties LITTLE JODY, a petite slave girl (eighteen)
to a dead tree stump.
BIG JOHN BRITTLE paces, taking a few practice CRACKS with his WHIP.
LITTLE JODY begs The Shaffer Brothers The Brittle Brothers for mercy.
ROGER goes and sits on a old wagon wheel to watch the whippin'.

BIG JOHN BRITTLE
Now Jody quit your caterwaulin'. You know
yourself it's for your own good. Niggers
are clumsy. You'd break everything in
goddamn sight, you weren't cured. And the
only known cure for nigger clumsiness
is a peelin'.
Little Jody begs to differ.

BACK TO DJANGO
As Django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass to
Little Jody and The Brittle Brothers, he collects eight little friends
who happily run along with the fast walking man. EIGHT LITTLE FRENCH
BULLDOGS who bark, yelp, snort and breath at his heels.. Django pays the
little dogs no nevermind.









3 2-

BACK TO BIG JOHN BRITTLE
In position to take the skin off of Little Jody's back.

BIG JOHN
After this we'll see if you break eggs again.

DJANGO
turns the corner to the stable, and stands behind them. They don't see
him. Big John rears back to make the first WHIP LASH...

WHEN ...
.DJANGO'S VOICE, stops him;

DJANGO
John Brittle!
Big John breaks his whip stride, looks. up, and in a discarded full
length broken mirror from the big house, laying abandoned against the
stable wall, he see's DJANGO, dressed in his powder blue satin Little
Lord Flauntleroy outfit, surrounded by his pack of little French
Bulldogs.
LITTLE JODY on her knees, tied to the dead tree stump, looks up see's
the same thing in the mirror.
LITTLE RAJ looks to his left at the sounds of the voice.
BIG JOHN turns toward Django, who he still doesn't recognize.
DJANGO just stares back.
BIG JOHN smile disappears. He recognizes Django.
So does Roger.

LITTLE RAJ
Django?
Django crosses toward Big John, raising up his arm like he's going to
shake his hand ...

DJANGO
Remember me?
.Django extends his arm, and Dr.Schultz's Derringer arm
contraption,. POPS the TINY GUN into his hand, and he FIRES a tiny
bullet smack dab into BIG JOHN'S MERCILESS HEART.

BIG JOHN FACE
goes into shock... .he falls to his knees...he looks up, clutching his
heart, at Django.

DJANGO
I like the way you die, boy.









3 3
Big John hears it...then tips over dead.
LITTLE JODY can't believe what she's just seen.
FOUR OTHER SLAVES who just happen to be walking in the background, see
it.
LITTLE RAJ is stunned ... . then comes to his senses, fumbling for the
gun he wears on his hip, but since he's no gunman, in his haste, he
gets it out of his holster, but drops it on the ground.
It goes off... BANG.
SHOOTING himself in the foot, he HOPS UP AND DOWN in pain.
The Bulldogs scatter at the sound. of the BANG.
DJANGO picks Big John's WHIP off the ground., and begins WHIPPING
LITTLE RAJ across the face and chest.
MORE SLAVES gather.

DJANGO WHIPS HIM TO THE GROUND
whips him on the ground, then throws the whip to the ground, picks
Roger's pistol off the ground, and empties it (FIVE SHOTS) into Roger.
To say the slaves are flabbergasted, is a understatement.
Dr.Schultz rides his horse up quickly, rifle in his hand. He sees
Django, and the two dead bodies.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Who are they?

DJANGO
That's John Brittle, and that's his
little brother Raj.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Where's Ellis?

DJANGO
He's the one hightailin' it across that
field right now.
Ellis Brittle riding his horse full out through the cotton field trying
to make an escape.

SCHULTZ'S WINCHESTER
goes to his eye, he follows the rider with his rifle barrel.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Are you sure that's him?
Ellis gets further away...









DJANGO
Yes!
Dr.SCHULTZ
Are you positive?
Ellis gets further away...

DJANGO
I dunno.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You don't know if you're positive?
Ellis gets further away...

DJANGO
I don't know what, positive,'means.
Dr.SCHULTZ
It means you're sure.

DJANGO
Yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, what?

DJANGO
Yes I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

BAM!
The German picks the middle Brittle brother off his horse.
The dead man WIPES OUT horribly in the thick cotton brush.
RED BLOOD splashes on WHITE COTTON.
The German and Django have the entire plantation's attention.
Spencer Bennett (with his Winchester), his SONS and his OVERSEERS,
and some HOUSE NIGGERS come around like a angry mob.
The German tosses his rifle in the dirt, and raises his hands.
Django does the same with his pistol.
Dr.Schultz addresses the ANGRY MOB.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Everybody calm down, we mean no one else any harm!

SPENCER
Just who the hell are you two jokers?









35;
Dr   . SCHULTZ
I am Dr.King Schultz, a legal representative
of the criminal justice system of the
United States of America. The man to my
left is Django Freeman, he's my. deputy.
In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit
court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin
Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or
alive, of John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, and
Roger Brittle --

DJANGO
- They were goin by the name, Shaffer.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You know them by the name, Shaffer.
But the butchers real names'were Brittle.
These are wanted men. The law wants them
for murder. I reiterate, this warrant
states dead or alive. When Django and myself
executed these men on sight, we were operating
within our legal. boundaries. Now I realize
passions are high. But I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force
against a officer of the court in the
performance of his duty is, you will be
hung by the neck until you are dead.
This does put a momentary pause in the lynch mob's blood lust.
After his dramatic pause for effect...
.Dr.Schultz says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
May I please remove the warrant from my
pocket so you may examine it?
Resting his Winchester over his shoulder, Bennett reaches for the
paper.

SPENCER
Gimmie.
Dr.Schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket, and hands it to
the plantation owner. Bennett reads it silently to himself, resigned to
what it says.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Satisfied.
Bennett eyes go from the warrant to the German.
Dr.SCHULTZ
May I have that back?









36
,- Bennett hands Schultz back the piece of paper.
Dr.SCHULTZ
We good?

BENNETT
Get off my land.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Post haste.

(TO DJANGO)
Load up the bodies as quickly as
you can, and let's get out of
here.

TIME CUT
All three dead Brittle Brothers lie over the back of the extra horse
the bounty hunters brought with them.
Both Bounty Hunters are back in their saddles ready to leave.
With all the eyes of the plantation on them, the white and black man
start to ride out, when Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett, steps in their way
for one final threat.

BENNETT
Ain't nobody gonna touch you and your Jimmie
while you on my property. But for lettin' a
nigger kill a white man, and especially for
letting a nigger kill a white man in a
audience of niggers, y'all ain't gonna make
it out of the county alive. Mark my words
Schultz, by tomorrow morning your niggers
gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin'
from my motherfuckin' gate.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm fully aware Bennett, that you and your
regulator playmates aren't shy about
killing for what you believe in. But mark
my words Big Daddy, if you make a move
towards Django or myself, you better be
prepared to die for it.
The two men ride off.
The Black and White Audience watch them go.

lying on his belly in the grass.

SPENCER BENNETT
That's them sonsabitches.

SPENCER'S POV:
We see the camp by the lake that Dr.Schultz and Django have set up.
Both wrapped up in bedrolls. The dead bodies of the Brittle Brothers
lie by them in a pile. A campfire slowly dims.
We Cut Back to Spencer Bennett lying on his belly with SIX OTHER RIFLE
CARING MEN observing the camp, from over a grade.
The Men sneak back down the hill the way they came...
Where about TWENTY-FOUR REGULATORS are waiting for them ON HORSEBACK,
all of the riders heads are covered by FLOUR SACKS with eyes and mouth
holes cut out. Some carry TORCHES, all carry RIFLES or SHOTGUNS.
Spencer mounts his horse. "Big Daddy" issues orders astride his
steed..

SPENCER BENNETT
Now unless they start shootin' first,
nobody shoot 'em. That's way too simple
for these jokers. We're gonna whip that
nigger lover to death. And I'm gonna
personally, strip and clip that garboon
myself.
Having said his blood thirsty words, he puts the flour sack over his
head. He tussles with the sack for a bit, then from inside the sack;

SPENCER BENNETT
Damn, I can't see fuckin' shit outta
this thing.
He sticks his fingers in the.eye holes, and rips, trying to make the
holes bigger, he only succeeds in making-visibility more obscured.

Randy tears at his bag.

RANDY
Oh shit, I just made mine worse.
He puts it on-then says;

RANDY
Yep, it's worse.
He yanks it off his head.

RANDY
Did anybody bring any extra bags?

TERRY
No, no one brought a extra bag!

RANDY

DOUG
Do we hafta wear 'em when we ride?

Redfish, fatter then some (but not all), takes off his bag.

REDFISH
I can't see in this fucking thing!
I can't breathe in this fucking thing!
And I can't ride in this fucking thing!

WILLARD
Fuck all y'all! I'm going home. I watched
my wife work all day gettin' thirty bags
ready for you ungrateful sonsabitches!
And all I hear is criticize, criticize, criticize.
From now on don't ask me or mine for nothin'!
Willard rides off.
O.B. removes his bag, and yells after Willard.

SPENCER
O.B., I tole yo to keep quiet! They're asleep,
not dead.

O.B.
But Willards riding off.

SPENCER
Fuck Willard! Look, let's not forget why we're
here. We gotta killer nigger over that hill.
And we gotta make a lesson outta 'em.

RANDY
Okay, I'm confused, are the bags on or off?
Robert takes off his bag, and says;

ROBERT
I think we all think the bags was a nice
idea. But, not pointing any fingers, they
could of been done better. So how 'bout,
no bags this time, but next time, we do the
bags right, and then we go full regalia.
Everyone takes off their bag.

SPENCER
Wait a minute, I didn't say no bags!









YO

TERRY
But nobody can see.

SPENCER
So?

TERRY
So, it would be nice to see.

SPENCER
Goddamit, this is a raid! I can't see, you
can't see, so what? All that matters is can
the fuckin horse see! That's a raid.
Spencer puts on his sack, everyone else, reluctantly, does as well.

EXT - LAKE - NIGHT
The THIRTY RIDERS, all with SACKS OVER THEIR HEADS, come riding over
the hill, hooting and hollerin. Since nobody can see they ride
haphazard into each other.'Redfish falls off his horse hard on his fat
ass. They surround the camp, and when the sleeping Schultz and Django
don't react, they know something's up. But since nobody can see,
everybody and everybody's horse is. confused.

WE HEAR A GROUP OF LINES FROM CIRCLING COWBOYS ON HORSEBACK WITH BAGS
OVER THEIR HEADS: "Where are they, I can't see" - "They tricked us" -
"Did somebody fall" "Where the hell are they" "Y'all, Redfish fell
off his horse-He's kinda hurt bad."
Then amongst the confusion...

WE SNAP ZOOM TO

A BIG TREE
on the other side of the lake
Then quickly cut into The Tree.
Till we're in a CU OF Dr.SCHULTZ
with a SCOPE SIGHT RIFLE up to his eye.

SCOPE SIGHT POV
The Yellow covered STICKS OF DYNAMITE protruding from the ground, are
inside the scope sight circle, Horse hooves step around it.

TWO SHOT
Dr.SCHtJLTZ and DJANGO up in a tree.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Auf wiedersehen.









L,
He fires.
The Camp EXPLODES Blowing Horses and Riders Apart.
Dr.Schultz and Django lift up repeating rifles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Let 'em have it!

DJANGO
I can't see nothin'.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Just fire into the smoke.
The two treetop killers let loose with rifle fire.

INSIDE OF THE SMOKE
pandemonium reigns. Horses and Men trip over bodies and pieces of
bodies, of horses and men. Men with legs and arms blown off, yell
bloody murder, hurt and scared Horses cry. Some struggle to get the
sacks off their heads, while scared horses dance and buck in panic.
Some are shot by the rifle fire. The rest of the men not blown up, and
still on horseback, between the sacks and the smoke, still can't see
worth a damn. And Men and Horses collide with one another, which causes
more bucking and riders falling. About fifteen of the men who can still
ride, high tail it the fuck out of there. Whipped and whimpering like
dogs.

SPENCER BENNETT
on his horse with the other fleeing regulators RIDES for his life...

SCOPE SIGHT POV
We see the back of the fleeing Bennett smack dab in the cross hairs.

DJANGO
scope sight rifle up to his eye.
Schultz next to him, says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
He's getting away.

DJANGO
I got 'em.

SPENCER'S HORSE
his hooves race and rip up the grass.

SPENCER
riding for his life...

DJANGO
scope sight rifle up to his eye.








Dr.SCHULTZ
He's getting out of range.

DJANGO
I got 'em.
INSERT: A black finger squeezes the rifle trigger.

SPENCER BENNETT
we're behind him as he rides away, OFF SCREEN we hear the whistling of
what sounds like an incoming missle.

SPENCER BENNETT
we're in.front of Spencer Bennett as he rides, when Django's bullet,
RIPS THROUGH his CHEST.

DJANGO

DJANGO
I got 'em.

SPENCER BENNETT
falls from his horse, dead.

DJANGO
scope sight rifle in his hand, big smile on his face, looks.to
Dr.Schultz.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like that, huh?
Referring to the scope sight rifle;

DJANGO
I like.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, I think while they take this opportunity
to lick their wounds, we should take this
opportunity to get the fuck out of Tennessee.
They hop out of the tree.

MONTAGE
Dr.Schultz in a big city, buying Django a new saddle. Django gets his
first initial "D" etched into it. The men go to different stores to
purchase Django's wardrobe. The outfit bought, is selected by Django,
with suggestions offered by Schultz. When he's done, Django looks damn
handsome in his new duds. Brown cowboy boots, Green Corduroy Jacket,
Smokey Grey Shirt, Tan Skin Tight Pants, and Light Brown Cowboy Hat.
He looks a. bit like Elvis in "Flaming Star" and a Little Joe Cartwright
on "Bonanza". However, tellingly, he keeps Ace Speck's Winter Coat as
his winter coat.









EXT - COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
Django, sitting on his new saddle, in his new duds, rides alongside
the good doctor Schultz. The German carries a PICNIC BASKET.
Dr.SCHULTZ
But I'm serious son, Greenville is just too
dangerous for you to go fucking around there.
You're a freed, slave, you should be in New York.
You shouldn't be in Greenville, you shouldn't
even be forty miles on any side of Greenville.,
You shouldn't be anywhere in Mississippi.

DJANGO
She's my wife, it's my job to look after her.
If Greenville's where I gotta go to find out
where she went, then I gotta go. Now you
were sayin' where I gotta go first?
Dr.SCHULTZ
There'should be some sort of records office.
You know when she was sold, you know where
she came from, the Carrucan Plantation, and
you know her name ... . what is her name?

DJANGO
Broomhilda.
Schultz reacts.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Broomhilda?
Django.nods his head yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Were her owners German?
Now Django reacts, "How did he know that?

DJANGO
Yeah, how did you know? She wasn't born on
The Carrucan Plantation. She was raised by
a German mistress, The Von Shafts. She can
speak a little German too.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Your wife?

DJANGO
Yeah, when she was little her mistress taught
her so she'd have somebody to talk German with.
Dr.SCHULTZ
So let me get this straight, your slave
wife speaks German, and her name is
Broomhilda Von Shaft...?









DJANGO
Yep. Mouthful, huh?
Dr.SCHULTZ
To say the least.
(stopping the horse)
This looks like a very pretty place to have
our picnic. What'd ya say, here?

TIME CUT

EXT - PICNIC IN COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
The two men sit on a blanket with a nice picnic spread spread out.
Django eats a cucumber sandwich with the crust cut off, and drinks a
cup of tea.

DJANGO
How did you know Broomhilda's first masters
were German?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Broomhilda is a German name. If they named
her, it stands to reason they'd be German.

DJANGO
Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda?
Dr.SCHULTZ
No, not so much. Broomhilda is the name of
a character in one of the most popular of
all the German legends.

DJANGO
Really? There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes there is.

DJANGO
Do you know it?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Every German knows that story. Would you
like me to tell you?
Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well Broomhilda was a princess. She was the
daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

DJANGO
What she do.?








Dr.SCHULTZ
I don't exactly remember. I think she disobeys
him in some way. So at first he's just going to
obliterate her -

DJANGO
Obliterate... . what does that mean?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Like blow up.
He pantomimes a explosion.

DJANGO
Phew, that's pretty mad.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a
little time, he calms down a bit. He's
still mad at her. He still wants to punish her.
Just not ... . blow her up. So instead what he
does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain.

DJANGO
Broomhilda's on a mountain?
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's a German legend, there's always going
to be a mountain in there somewhere. So, he
puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a
fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
And. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire.
And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero
arises brave enough to save her.

DJANGO
Does a fella arise?
From now on as Dr.Schultz talks, he's beginning to realize something he
wasn't aware of when the conversation started.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes Django, as a matter he does. A fella
named, Sigfried.

DJANGO
Does Sigfried save her?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so.
Now true, he is assisted in his triumph by
a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having
said that, Sigfried triumphs over all of his
obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to
his courage. He scales the mountain, because he's
not afraid of it. He defeats the dragon, because
he's not afraid.of him.








Dr.SCHULTZ (CON'T)
He walks through hellfire because
Broomhilda's worth. it.
After that last line of dialogue... .the two men just let a moment pass
as they nibble on their sandwiches.

DJANGO
I know how he feels.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I think I'm just starting to realize that.
He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot, as he
thinks about what he's going to say next.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Look Django, I don't doubt one day you will
save your lady love. But I'm afraid I can't
let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.
Let me ask you a question, how do you like
the bounty hunting business?

DJANGO
Kill white folks, and they pay ya?
What's not to like?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I hafta admit, we make a good team.

DJANGO
But I'thought you were mad at me for killin'
Big John and Rodger?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, on that occasion, you were a tad
overzealous. But normally, that's a good
thing. How'd you like to partner up for
the winter?

DJANGO
What'd ya mean partner up?
Dr.SCHULTZ
You be my deputy, for real this time. A lot
of the big money is in outlaw gangs. Some
of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or
three thousand a piece. With one man, anything
over three men is a risk. But with a partner?
Creating cross fire? It's fish in a. barrel.
A lot of these gangs hold up in the'hills
for the winter.

DJANGO
You makin' another agreement?









W7
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes. You work with me through the winter,
till the snow melts. I give you a third
of my bounties. And while we're together,
I'll teach you a few things you're going
to need to know.

DJANGO
Can you teach me how to make Tony do that
head bow thing that Fritz can do?
Dr.SCHULTZ
That among other things. We make some
money this winter, when the snow melts,
I'll take you to Greenville myself, and
we'll find where they sent your wife.
I'm pretty good at finding people. Is it a deal?
No white man has ever done anything for Django, just to him. So
understandably, he's a little suspicious.

DJANGO
Why you care what happens to me? Why you
care if I find my wife?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well frankly, I've never given anybody
their freedom before. And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you. You're
just not ready to go off on your own, it's
that simple. You're too green, you'll get hurt.
Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,.
it's kind of a big deal. As a German, I'm
obliged to help you on your quest to
rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
Django accepts that response.
What follows is a MONTAGE covering the five months that Django and
Schultz partner up as bounty hunters. Schultz wears his normal
ensemble. Django wears his cool looking Green Jacket, unless it's
really cold, which a lot of this Montage is. Then he still wears Ace
Specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes.

WE SEE
A SCENE to be improvised (more or less), where Dr.Schultz teaches
Django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip.
By the end of the scene, after trial and error, we see Django's going
to be good at this.

EXT - HILLSIDE - SUNNY DAY
We see Django and Dr.Schultz walking up a hill. Tony and Fritz have
been left tied up downhill. Django leads a extra body HORSE (named
PONCHO) behind him. Dr.Schultz carries his scope sight rifle in 'a long
case. They get to the top of the hill. It overlooks a small farmhouse.









Y, 8

DOWN BELOW WE SEE
A LITTLE MAN struggling behind a plow, and his FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON
helping him by leading the horse forward.
On top of their perch on the hill top, Dr.Schultz says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Keep down or he'll see you.

DJANGO
Who that farmer? Who cares?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well since we came here to kill 'em, he
just might.

DJANGO
What? The little man pushin' that plow?
Dr.SCHULTZ
That little man pushing that plow, is Smitty Bacall.

DJANGO
Smitty Bacall is a farmer?
Dr.SCHULTZ
No. Smitty Bacall is a stagecoach robber
who's hiding out as a farmer, because
there's a seven thousand dollar bounty on
his head.
He hands Django the scope rifle case.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And he's all yours my boy.
DJANGO lays on his belly, with the Scope Sight up to his eye.

SCOPE SIGHT POV:
on the Farmer struggling behind his plow, working hard with his horse
and his son.
Django's finger on the trigger... .but he hesitates.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh what happened.to mister I wanna kill white
folks for money?

DJANGO
His son's with him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Good. He'll have a loved one with him.
Maybe even share a last word. That's
better then most get, and a damn. sight
better then he deserves.









1   9
Django still hesitates.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Put down the rifle. Don't worry, I'm not
mad at you. Take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
Django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Read it aloud. Consider it today's lesson.

DJANGO

(READING)
"Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
The Smitty Bacall Gang. For murder and
stagecoach robbery. Seven thousand dollars
for Smitty Bacall. One thousand and five
hundred dollars for each of his gang members.
Known members of The Smitty Bacall Gang are as
follows, DANDY MICHAELS, GERALD NASH, and

CRAZY CRAIG KOONS."
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well done. Bravo. THAT is who Smitty Bacall
is. If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at
twenty-two, they would never of printed that.

(REFERRING TO

THE HANDBILL)
But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches,
and he didn't mind killing people to do it.
You want to save your wife by doing what
I do? This is what I do. I kill people,
and sell their corpses for cash. His corpse
is worth seven thousand dollars.
Now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him.
Django SHOOTS.
The Little Man down below behind the plow falls down.
The Young Boy doesn't know what happened at first. Then he figures'out
his father was just shot. He goes to him in the dirt.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You need to keep that Smitty Bacall handbill.

DJANGO
Why?
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's good luck. You always keep the
handbill of your first bounty.
They begin walking down the hill, to collect Smitty Bacall's body,
leading the extra body horse behind them.









50
As they walk down hill, they watch the little scene of Smitty Bacall's
Son cradling his dying father.in his arms, the older man speaking his
last words to his son before he dies.
Dr.SCHULTZ
See, they're having a tender little father son
moment now. No doubt the most heartfelt one
they've ever had.

EXT - SNOWY FOREST - NIGHT
It's now full on snowy winter in the hills.
Django practices his quick draw against a SNOWMAN he's built. He sticks
a BOTTLE in it, so the bottom of the bottle is where the snowman's
heart would be.
He DRAWS...
Shoots the bottle heart!
He DRAWS ...
Shoots the left coal eye.
He DRAWS ...
Shoots the right coal eye.
He DRAWS...
Shoots the carrot nose.
Dr.Schultz comes up behind him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I think it's safe to say you're faster then
the snowman.

EXT - SNOWY FOREST - DIFFERENT NIGHT
A outlaw gang known as The WILSON - LOWE GANG (five guys) ride through
a snowy forest at night. When all five men and their Horses, are SHOT

FROM ABOVE.

DJANGO AND SCHULTZ
up in a tree, FIRING DOWN ON them.

EXT - WINTER MOUNTAIN TOWN MAIN STREET - NIGHT
The FLAKES continue to FALL HARD as Dr.Schultz and Django ride down
the main street of town, pulling poor Poncho who's FULLY LOADED DOWN
with five corpses.









571
The local SHERIFF, DON GUS, watches the two men ride up, he knows them.

SHERIFF GUS
Doctor and Django, how the hell are ya,
and who the hell ya got there?
Dr.SCHULTZ
The Wilson - Lowe Gang.

SHERIFF GUS
Who the hell's The Wilson - Lowe Gang?
Dr.Schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket, and hands
it down to the friendly peace officer.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Bad Chuck Wilson, and meaner Bobby Lowe.
And three of their acolytes.

SHERIFF GUS
Just leave 'em out here, they ain't going
nowhere. And if'in they do, god must love
'em, so who are we to say. Come outta the
snowy snow and git yourself some coffee.

TNT - SHERIFF GUS'S OFFICE - NIGHT
The snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office.
They exchange pleasantries about the weather as the Sheriff pours them
coffee. After the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot
liquid, they get down to business. As Schultz and Gus discuss the
bounties, Django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall. On the
third one he reads, WARREN VANDERS, and a two thousand dollar bounty,
"That one", Schultz says.
Django RIPS IT off the wall.
As the winter has progressed, we see they've become a genuine bounty
hunting team. And Django, a genuine bounty hunter.

EXT - PRETTY MEADOW - DAY
The snow has melted, and it's SPRING. And inside of this meadow Django
practices his fast draw against five men...
.by Schultz throwing FIVE COINS in the air ...
DJANGO DRAWS FAST shoots three coins, FIRES again hitting another, then
falls to the ground to get the fifth.
He looks up from the ground at Schultz.









5L
As Schultz collects the coins off the ground, he says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You're pretty confident aren't you?
Django nods his head, yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You have reason to be.
He holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm.
All the coins have bullet holes dead in their center. He drops them on
top of Django.

DJANGO
Still think I'm too green for Greenville?
Dr.Schultz removes a pipe, sticks it in his mouth and says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh you're ready for Greenville.
He lights a match, then lights the pipe, puffing as he says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Greenville ready for you, that I'm not so
sure.
He blows out the match...

WE GO TO BLACK
What we also saw in the above montage is Django shake off a lifetime of
slavery. Django, in his green jacket, in his cowboy hat, on top of his
steed Tony, with his gun hanging from his hip, has become his own man.
He's not a slave anymore. He's a bounty hunter.

BLACK TITLE CARD
ACROSS THE SCREEN ONE LETTER AT A TIME STYLE (ala "Rocky" and

"FLASHDANCE")

MISSISSIPPI

CUT TO

EXT - THE TOWN OF GREENVILLE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
The whole Main Street of Greenville is thick with five inches of shit
brown mud that all the horse hooves, and wagon wheels, and slave feet
have to wade through to get from one end of the town to the other.









53
We see Django and Dr.Schultz enter the town, and slosh their horses in
the mud,, down the main street of Greenville Mississippi. The buying and
selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around.
BLACK MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN in BONDAGE are everywhere you look.
LINES OF CHAINED SLAVES being marched one way or the other, move
through the muddy streets of Greenville. WHITE MEN on horses move them
along.
BUCKBOARDS filled with DOMESTIC SLAVES (HOUSE NIGGERS), and pretty
PONYS, driven by WHITE MEN roll through the street.
A YOUNG WHITE BOY (14 years old), a shepherd, leads a bunch of
SLAVE CHILDREN through town. A SHEPHERD'S DOG, HELPS HIM OUT BY MOVING

THE KIDS ALONG.
Impromptu slave auctions take place on almost every block.
A SUBTITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the screen:

GREENVILLE

CHICKASAW COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI
Dr.Schultz takes in this African flesh market, where human beings sell
other human beings, with disgust and a little bit of shock.
Django is neither disgusted or. shocked, he knows first hand how
Greenville operates.
As he rides Tony through town in his snappy duds, he looks'at the BLACK
MEN half dressed: in chains. He REMEMBERS HIMSELF with his six Other
Companions from earlier, being walked through the mud of Main Street by
The Speck Brothers. On that day he might as well of been a steer.
Today, with a gun on his hip, money in his pocket, in his snappy
outfit, astride his steed Tony, he feels so different from these
wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill.
Django sees the towns railroad depot, and across from it a huge SLAVE
PEN, like a STEER CORRAL. At the moment there's no train in the depot.

WE FLASH ON
The TRAIN, at a earlier time, pulling into the depot.

INSIDE ONE OF THE BOXCARS
amidst a boxcar full of shirtless BLACK MALES, Django watches the train
pull into the station, from inside the wooden slates of the boxcar.:
A hatch in the roof of the boxcar is NOISILY YANKED OPEN, and TWO WHITE
SLAVE TRADERS (RUSS AND JUDD), peer down at their human cargo.

JUDD
Good god almighty these niggers stink!









I F

RUSS
Niggers stink, where's the shock?
(to the Slaves

BELOW)
Okay you bucks, listen up, and listen
well, I'm only gonna say this once.
There's a slave corral right across from
this boxcar. We gittin ready to open these
doors. When we do, y'all run as fast as you
can, right into that pen. 'Anyone gittin off
trail, gonna get hurt and hurt bad. Now you
niggers better comprehend. And that goes for
any African garboons amongst y'all can't
understand english ... . your American buddies
better shove your ass in the right direction,
or your trip to this country is going to be
short, and pointless. Train to pen as fast as
you can!
The boxcar door is slid open, and a HUNDRED AND FIFTY BLACK MALES
run full out from the train to the steer corral.
We spot Django during the running.
Once inside the corral, the gate is closed.
COWBOYS with rifles act as prison guards.

INSIDE THE CORRAL
through the wooden posts, in the distance, Django watches them open up
the boxcar holding the females. They do their run to their pen out of
view.
Django catches a quick glimpse of Broomhild.a running with the other
LADIES, then she's gone from view.

BACK TO DJANGO (PRESENT)
Django and Dr.Schultz on top of their horses, taking in the sight of
Greenville.
Dr.SCHULTZ
It's a spectacle out of Dante.

DJANGO
You should see it from the other side.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Frankly, I don't know if I could endure this.

DJANGO
You'd be surprised what you can endure.

(BEAT)
Where to?

Dr.SCHULTZ
Records office.

CUT TO

INT - RECORDS OFFICE - DAY
Dr.Schultz and Django walk into a records office, lined with books.
We watch through the store front window, the black man and white man
enter, and Dr.Schultz present his business card to a Dickensian looking
RECORDS OFFICE WORKER. As Schultz starts his spellbinding with words
routine... . The CAMERA FADES TO BLACK.

BLACK TITLE CARD:

BROOMHILDA

INT - SLAVE PEN - DAY
The same shot we saw before of Django fighting his way to the bars of
the slave pen, to get a better last look of Broomhilda.
Broomhilda, as before is walked by in the distance.
Then, as before Django loses sight of her.

EXT - MAIN STREET - GREENVILLE - DAY
We follow in front of Broomhilda being lead out of the slave pen by TWO
WHITE MALE SLAVERS. Her bare feet slosh in the Main Street mud, and
the leg irons scrap her ankles.
Up until now everything you've ever seen of Broomhilda, has only been
in Django's Spaghetti Western Flashbacks. In other words, from his
perspective, and memory. This is the,only time the story will shift to
Broomhilda's perspective. The strong but frightened girl is led out on
to the hustle and bustle, and wagon wheels and horse hoofs of Main
Street.
Broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that Django
was sold in at the beginning. Instead She's just lifted up on a parked
buckboard wagon. Her SELLER (CLYDE) starts his pitch on the TWELVE or
so BUYERS that watch this puny make shift auction.

BROOMHILDA
looks down into the crowd of twelve ugly white men, and holds her
breath which one will buy her.
Among the ugly white men we see Mr.HARMONY (MIKE), not quite as ugly as
the rest. An older well dressed, classy gentleman. Next to him is his
twenty four year old overweight awkward son SCOTTY HARMONY.








Scotty in the audience, and Broomhilda on the wagon, THEIR EYES MEET,
he nudges his dad.
The Seller makes her expose her breasts to the small crowd. Then her
back, revealing her whip marks. Then pointing out the runaway "r"
branded in her cheek.
Some of the crowd, including Scotty, react with repulsion at the sight
of the whip marks. The Seller assures the crowd, that niggers don't
feel pain like white folks, and it only makes the women more gentle.

SELLER - CLYDE
Fellahs, you ain't felt gentle, till you felt
nigger gal gentle.

UGLY MAN
makes a bid.

BROOMHILDA
yikes.

UGLIER MAN
higher bid.

BROOMHILDA

A SEVENTY FIVE YEAR OLD INDIAN ON A MULE
makes a bid.
Mr.Harmony makes a bid for his son Scotty.
Broomhilda notices that. And makes more eye contact with Scotty.
They look at each other as Mr.Harmony continues to bid.
A LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.









NARRATOR (VO)
On that day, eight months ago, the auction
was won by Mike Harmony, as a birthday present
for his fat boy son Scotty.
Mr.Harmony congratulates his son.
From on top of the buckboard Broomhilda looks down at her new owners.
Later they leave for the Harmony house. Scotty lifts Broomhilda up into
the back of the buckboard. He hands her a little white bag.

SCOTTY
This is for you.
She opens the bag,candies of many colors sit in it.

SCOTTY
They're jelly beans. Try one.
She selects a yellow one and puts it in her mouth.

SCOTTY
Good huh?
She nods her head, yes.
We see him drive the buckboard out of Greenville with Broomhilda in the
back eating her bag of jelly beans.

 XT - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
The buckboard makes its way down a country road. Broomhilda in the
back, and Scotty driving the wagon.
Scotty bought her, but he's too scared to talk to her.
Broomhilda's muddy bare feet dangle off the wagon. She's beginning to
realize the young master is the shy type.

BROOMHILDA
Master Scotty... ?

SCOTTY
Yes Broomhilda?

BROOMHILDA
I'm lonely back here. Can I come on up with
you on that seat so we can talk?

SCOTTY
Please, I'd love that.
She climbs into the driver's seat. In more ways then one.

EXT - THE HARMONY HOUSE - DAY
A nice two story southern house. Very nice, but hardly a plantation.
The household's FOUR DOMESTIC SLAVES. Broomhilda will be the fifth. The
buckboard pulls up to the front of the house.
Scotty's mother, Mrs.HARMONY (MARY LOUISE), waits to meet her son, and
his new bought nigger gal.
The older lady looks the black girl up and down and says to her;
Mrs.HARMONY
What's your name, gal?

BROOMHILDA
Broomhilda.
Mrs.HARMONY
Follow me. into the kitchen,
('to her son)
You stay out here.

INT - KITCHEN - DAY
Mrs.Harmony brings Broomhilda in her kitchen. The TWO DOMESTIC SLAVES
that were in, there are chased out by the boss lady. Mrs.Harmony grabs
Broomhilda by the wrist, and tells her;
Mrs.HARMONY
I want to have a word with you, wench. You met
my boy Scotty. You can tell ain't no white
girl gonna fool with him. And if they do fool
with him, they fool with him for the wrong
reason. Boy's twenty four, he still ain't a
man yet. That's why you're here. Be nice to him.
He's a very sweet boy. Play him right, he'll
eat bird seed out of your palm. Play 'em
wrong, you'll deal with me.

BROOMHILDA
I like Scotty. He's just shy is all. All he
needs is a little confidence.
Mrs.HARMONY
And you'll give that to him?

BROOMHILDA
I'll do my best, mam. Scotty's a real sweet boy.
Mrs.HARMONY
He is, isn't he?

BROOMHILDA
Ah-huh.
The mother lets go of the young lady's wrist.

NARRATOR (VO)
Basically The Harmony's bought a slave
bride for young master Scotty that day.
And the two kids had a nice time playing
house for awhile.
We see Scotty and Broomhilda catching butterflies in butterfly nets in
the daytime..
At night they catch LIGHTNING BUGS together.
At night in Scotty's bed, while the young man lay fast asleep,
Broomhilda looks at her jelly jar of GLOWING LIGHTNING BUGS.

NARRATOR (VO)
As Scotty's sort of defacto sweetheart, if
no visitors were about, Broomhilda would
even join the family at their dinner table.
We see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes and
gravy.

NARRATOR.(VO)
And pretty soon she was adopted into a
member of the family.
Mrs.Harmony and Broomhilda sewing together.
The Harmony family and Broomhilda playing croquet in the front yard.
After dinner, Mrs.Harmony entertaining the family by playing the piano.
Mr.Harmony reading the women and his son a story from a storybook.

NARRATOR (VO)
Scotty was never happier.
Scotty and Broomhilda walking holding hands at Southern magic hour.
Broomhilda having sex with Scotty, baby talking with him, talking him
through it, making him feel loved and secure.

NARRATOR (VO)
After three months of this bliss,
Scotty decided to take Broomhilda for
a romantic weekend in Greenville.

SCOTTY AND BROOMHILDA
drive through the Main Street of Greenville, dressed to the nines, in a
fancy carriage. Broomhilda dressed in a beautiful white lace dress,
complete with white lace gloves, fancy ladies hat, and white parasol.
Scotty, very proud of his pretty Pony, is dressed in a fashion best
described as plantation pimp daddy.









6O

NARRATOR (VO)
White masters would take their pretty
Ponys to Greenville for a treat or romantic
excursion, for two reasons-One, seeing
how bad the other slaves had it, always made
the papered Ponys appreciate their privilege
position, (just in case they'd forgot).

BROOMHILDA
holding her parasol, looking like a black Daisy Miller, watches the
OTHER SLAVES march by in the mud. They watch her too.

INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
Broomhilda and Scotty, and their luggage, move into the fancy hotel
lobby, and rent a room at the front desk.

INSERT: HOTEL REGISTRY
Scotty signs his name. The DESK CLERKS HAND checks the box on the
registry book that indicates darkee female companion.

INT -. GREENVILLE - NIGHT
Greenville at night is a little different. At night, RICH WHITE MASTERS
showing off their Ponys (like Scotty), rule the streets.

NARRATOR (VO)
And two, there was a sliver of society that
ran through Greenville at night that catered
to white masters who were infected with a
condition that was normally referred to as,
"Nigger love." At night the streets, the bars,
bistros, and buggy rides were ruled by rich
white masters showing off their pretty Pony's.

EXT - CLEOPATRA CLUB - NIGHT
An establishing shot.of the three story house that has been converted into
private club called, The Cleopatra Club.

NARRATOR (VO)
But the crown jewel of all this interracial
frivolity, was the members only, Cleopatra
Club.

INSERT: GOLD PLAQUE
with the name, THE CLEOPATRA CLUB on it, next to it is a profile of
Nefertiti.









6!

INT - THE CLEOPATRA CLUB - RESTAURANT - NIGHT
The interracial joint is jumping (as long as by interracial you mean
white men and black women).
Scotty and Broomhilda are enjoying a fancy dinner in the clubs dining
room.
We see across the dining room, the powerful white man, CALVIN CANDIE,
sitting with some White Men and some Black Ponys, eyeing Broomhilda.

SCOTTY
I gotta tell you Broomhilda -
I don't care if I go to. hell for this -
I love you. And if loving you means I go to
hell ... . Well then hello Mr.Devil.
That was actually kind of funny. Broomhilda was right, all he needed
was a little confidence. She puts her hand on his.

NARRATOR (VO)
Then... speak of the devil and the devil
appears.

CALVIN CANDIE
appears at their table.

CALVIN CANDIE
Hello, my name is Calvin Candie, I own
The Cleopatra Club. And I would just like
to welcome an attractive couple'like
yourselves to my favorite place on earth.
Scotty stands up and shakes hands with Calvin.

SCOTTY
Thank you so much, it's a great honor.
We love it here.
Pointing at a empty chair.

CALVIN CANDIE
May I join you?-

SCOTTY
Please, by all means.
Calvin sits down.
Broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack.
Scotty, as per usual, is clueless.

CALVIN CANDIE
How long have you been a member?









SCOTTY
We just joined this weekend.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well our little private oasis appreciates
your patronage. Some may consider the dues
excessive, but they're necessary for us to
create this haven for the alternative
lifestyle we've all become accustomed to.

SCOTTY
Well said, and money well spent.
He squeezes Broomhilda's hand.
Candie sees this.

CALVIN CANDIE
It would be.my pleasure, your first
weekend at the club, to join me and my
friends at my table.
Broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided.
But Scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like Calvin Candie.
She tries to imply they should stay where they are. He brushes her off
with a, "Don't be silly."
We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and they
join the party.
Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named SHEBA, whose dress
is a little more revealing then the others.
They drink and talk, and the White Men have a forced good time. But
Calvin Candie can't hide his sinister side from Broomhilda, and it
keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go
to bed. Scotty's having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts
to stay behind.'Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to Scotty's
disobedience. If these fancy.fucking white men weren't around making
Scotty feel so puffy chested, he'd never dismiss her that way.
We FOLLOW Broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel.

NARRATOR (VO)
After excusing herself, she walked across
the street to her hotel room. She got
her white dress dirty in the mud, but she
didn't care, the night was ruined anyway.
Some romantic weekend. Wait till she gets
home and tells his mother how he ignored her.
She'll fix his fat ass. Wait till he asks her
to scratch his back next time. She's gonna
scrape every pimple.









'3

   -. BACK AT THE CLEO CLUB
The now drunk Scotty is playing poker with Calvin and his friends.

NARRATOR (VO)
Back at The Cleopatra Club, as the night
wore on, Calvin Candie suggested'a friendly
card game. As the game wore on, it came down
to a two thousand dollar pot between
Calvin Candie and Scotty Harmony. Luckily
for him, Scotty was holding.a inside straight.
Calvin holds his cards with Sheba draped around him. She whispers
something in his ear.

CANDIE

(TO SHEBA)
Really?

(TO SCOTTY)
You know what Sheba just tole me?
Scotty, thinking about his great hand, says;

SCOTTY
What?

CANDIE
She says she thinks you're cute.

SCOTTY
Really? Thank you Sheba, I think you're
beautiful.
Sheba whispers something else in Candie's ear.

CANDIE
Sheba says she'd like to give you a little
lip. Want some lip?
Scotty, is a little surprised.

SCOTTY
Well, she's your Pony...I mean...

CANDIE
Oh hush, what's a little nigger lip 'tween
friends. Go on honey, give 'em some sugar.
Sheba walks over to Scotty's side of the table, and gives him a very lip
intensive'soul kiss. The table enjoys the show. Then Sheba goes back to
Calvin's side of the table.
The game continues.









G

CANDIE
Okay loverboy, I think you're trying to out
brazen me in my own club, and I won't have
it. If you're really holding cards, time to
pony up. I raise you five hundred.
Candie throws in his chips.

SCOTTY.
I see your five hundred...
(throws in chips)
.and raise you four hundred more.
(tosses his last chips)
Call.
This is where Calvin Candie has waited to be all night.

CALVIN CANDIE
Not so fast, boy.

(BEAT)
Pot ain't fat enough yet.

SCOTTY
I'm all in.

CALVIN CANDIE
Ain't that too bad.
Scotty doesn't intend to let this smiling Jack cheat him out of his
pot, especially with him holding an inside straight.

SCOTTY
I would think a southern gentleman of
such renown as yourself, wouldn't have
to resort to buying a pot in his own club.
Calvin writes on a piece of paper, then throwsit'in the pot.

CALVIN CANDIE
One final raise.
Scotty takes the piece of paper, "What's this?"

CALVIN CANDIE
It's Sheba's bill of sale.

SCOTTY
What? I don't want her.
Calvin.and the whole table laugh at that.

CALVIN CANDIE
You sure didn't look like you didn't want her.
More laughter.









CALVIN CANDIE
In Greenville slaves are currency. And
Sheba's worth about eight hundred dollars.
I'm throwing Sheba in the pot. Match or
fold?

SCOTTY
I'm all out of money.

CALVIN CANDIE
But we ain't playin' for money no more..
We matchin' nigger gals. And a nigger gal
you got.

SCOTTY
I can't bet Broomhilda.

CALVIN CANDIE
In Chickasaw County, she's money. Pony her up
or fold. Somebody get him a piece of paper
and a pencil.
Somebody does.

CALVIN CANDIE
Write out a bill of sale, or fold them cards.
Scotty makes a pressured decision.
He hurriedly takes the pencil and writes out a Bill of Sale for
Broomhilda.

SCOTTY
Let me see your cards!
Candie lays down his cards, he has a FLUSH.
What Scotty's just done hits him like a ton of bricks.

SCOTTY
You cheated me.
After Scotty uses the "C" word, everybody quiets down.

CALVIN CANDIE
What did you just call me?

SCOTTY
I called you a card cheatin' son of a bitch,
cause that's what you are!
Calvin calmly stands up from the table. He removes a small Derringer
Gun.from his pocket, and tosses it on the table in front of Scotty.
Then takes out another one, and tosses it on the table in front
himself .









66
Everybody in The Cleo Club quiets down.

CALVIN CANDIE
Scott Harmony. For calling me a card cheat
in my own club, as a southern gentleman,
I challenge you to a duel.
(to the Piano

PLAYER)
Piano player, will you hit three separate
notes?

(TO SCOTTY)
On the third note, pick up the gun and
try to kill me.
(to Piano player)
Piano player please ...
This is all going too fast for slow Scotty.

SCOTTY
Wait a minute ...no!

FIRST NOTE ...

SCOTTY
I ain't dueling with you! I don't want
to duel!

CALVIN CANDIE
Then get out of here, get in your buggy
and get out of town.

SCOTTY
Sure. Let me just get my girl.

CALVIN CANDIE
You lost that girl, fat boy.

SECOND NOTE...

SCOTTY
Wait!... . Look ... . Mr.Candie, I'm sorry I
called you a cheat. But... please...I can't
give you Broomhilda.

CALVIN CANDIE
Last chance fat boy, go home and get'useta
to fuckin' another one.

(BEAT)
Or pick up that gun.
Scotty can't leave. He can't go home without her. He can't face his
parents. He can't walk out on her. No matters what happens he can't
leave.









6 7

THIRD NOTE...
Calvin Candie SHOOTS Scotty Harmony dead.

INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
Calvin Candie and his entourage enter the hotel lobby and go up to the

FRONT DESK CLERK..

CALVIN CANDLE
Hello Oliver.

FRONT DESK CLERK (OLIVER)
Hello Mr.Candie, good evening.

CALVIN CANDLE
Good evening to you as well,. young Oliver.
Could you please inform me which room
your guest Scott Harmony is staying in?

INT - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Broomhilda is asleep in bed...

WHEN ...
.Calvin comes'BURSTING in the room holding his belt in his hand. He
YANKS OFF the sheets that Broomhilda sleeps under. Broomhilda lies
naked under the covers. Candie brings the belt down around her legs and
backside.
She hops out of bed.

INT - HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
Candie CHASES her naked body with his belt, from the top of the stairs,
down the stairs, and through the lobby, and out the front door.
All to the amusement of the WHITE HOTEL GUESTS.

EXT - GREENVILLE HOTEL - NIGHT
She RUNS out of the hotel naked, and then TRIPS FALLING INTO THE
GREENVILLE MUD. She looks up from the mud, at Calvin Candie looking
down at her.

CALVIN CANDIE
Welcome to Candyland.
We do a SLOW ZOOM into Broomhilda's face.









NARRATOR (VO)
That was four months ago.

CUT TO

INT - GREENVILLE SLAVE AUCTION - DAY
Back inside the three story Auction Block domed room.
The same room Django was sold in at the beginning.
Tons of WHITE BUYERS and SELLERS and BLACK SLAVES to be bought or sold
fill the big hall.

ONE MANDINGO SLAVE (BANJO)
stands half naked on the auction block.
The SELLER' (SHELBY)
gives the crowd,a sales pitch about Banjo, and starts the bidding.
Many different UGLY WHITE MEN make bids on the big mandingo, including
Calvin Candie.
Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO from a pair of OPERA GLASSES
 -. watch Calvin Candie from up above on the 2nd floor landing.
FROM Dr.SCHULTZ'S PERSPECTIVE
We see Calvin Candie, and his black slave.bodyguard, BARTHOLOMEW,
always dressed in a slightly ill fitting three piece suit and bowler
hat, among the crowd of buyers at the auction block below.
Candie's lawyer LEONIDE MOGUY joins him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Calvin Candle, and he is the
owner of Candyland.

DJANGO
Candyland? The mandingo fightin' place?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, so you heard of it?

DJANGO
Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well apparently, that's where your wife is,
and apparently the repellent gentleman down
there is the one who owns her.

        TIME CUT









6R
The White Man and Black Man find a cubby hole to talk in the auction
hall.
Dr.SCHULTZ
How much do you know about mandingo fighting?

DJANGO
Not so much... A little... Master Carrucan had
a couple niggers he'd fight.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you play a mandingo expert?

DJANGO
What?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you convincingly masquerade as someone
who is an expert on mandingo fighters?

DJANGO   
Why?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Because when a man has one of the four
biggest cotton plantations in Dixie, but
the only thing that seems to ring his chimes
is big sweaty black males, if WE want to get
his attention, we better be talking about
big sweaty black males. So my character is
that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here
in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo
fight game. And your character is the mandingo
expert I hired to help me do it.

DJANGO
They call that "One-Eyed Charly."
Dr.SCHULTZ.
One-Eyed Charly?

DJANGO
That's what you call it when you buy a slave
expert. If you wanna raise horses, but don't
know nothin' 'about horses, you buy yourself
a One-Eyed Charly who knows about horses.
He teaches ya. You wanna plant tobacco but
don't know nothin' about it, you buy yourself
a One-Eyed Charly knows about tobacco.
Dr'. SCHULTZ
Why do they call it One-Eyed Charly?









70

DJANGO
You know, back on the plantation, my. job
wasn't historian.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Testy. It's an unusual name. That's a perfectly
legitimate question. So, can you convincingly
play my mandingo One-Eyed Charly? Don't say,
yes, if you can't.

DJANGO
You want me to play a black slaver? There
ain't nothin lower then a black slaver. Black
slavers are lower then head house niggers, and
buddy, that's pretty fuckin low.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Then play him that way! Give me your black slaver.
Django gets that.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Can you do that?

DJANGO
That, I can do. What's next?
Dr.SCHULTZ
To get ourselves personally invited to
Candyland by Calvin Candie himself.

CUT TO

EXT - THE CLEOPATRA CLUB - NIGHT
Dr.SCHULTZ and DJANGO stand across the street from The Cleopatra Club.
Which looks like aregular nice three story house, among other.nice
houses on an affluent residential block in Greenville Mississippi.
They open the tiny garden gate in front of the house, walk up the stoop
steps to the front door. They ring the doorbell.
A pretty young black girl, dressed in a FRENCH MAID outfit opens the
door.

FRENCH MAID

(SOUTHERN ACCENT)
Bonjour.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(AMUSED)
Bonjour, mon petite femme noire.
We are here to see Calvin Candie.









7)
She's been taught to smile and say:

FRENCH MAID
Enter.
The two men walk into the entrance way of the house.
A beautiful mulatto HOSTESS greets the two men.

HOSTESS

(SPEAKING QUITE

REFINED)
Hello gentlemen, I'm Cleo, can I help you?
Dr.Schultz hands Cleo the guest card.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes I am Dr.King Schultz, and this is my
associate, Django Freeman.
Upon hearing Django is a free man her eyes go to, him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
We're here for a appointment with
Calvin Candie and Leo Moguy.

CLEO
Yes you gentlemen are expected. Please
make yourself comfortable. I'll inform
Monsieur Candie you've arrived.
(referring to the

FRENCH MAID)
Can Coco get either of you two gentlemen
a tasty refreshment?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Not at the moment.

CLEO
Then Coco will entertain you while I
inform Monsieur Candie.
Dr.SCHULTZ
How charming.
Cleo leaves.
Django wanders over the dining room, and peers inside.

INT - DINING ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) - NIGHT
A lush fancy restaurant dining area inside of this house. The DINERS
are made up exclusively of well dressed WHITE MEN, and pretty BLACK
GIRLS (PONYS) dressed in the most elaborate ladies fashions of the day.









72
Some appear to be on dates.
Some appear to be enjoying a special evening (birthday, anniversary,
special treat).
- Some are.two men with two women.
Some are one man with two or three or more women.
The white men's ages range from early twenties to old men.
The girls ages ranges from their twenties, to thirteen.
The bill of fare is a combination of French cuisine, and hearty beef
driven American dining.
The dolled up, decked out'Ponys eat rich French cuisine complete with
elaborate sauces, and take their knives to thick cuts of steak.
The younger little girls, usually eat ice cream with hot fudge, banana
splits, and cookies.
While-all the men drink whiskey or wine, the girls all drink
sarsaparilla.
Dr.Schultz quietly moves next to Django and asks;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Have you ever seen anything like this
before?
Django shakes his head, no.

COCO CHIRPS;

COLO. -

(VERY COUNTRY)
Y'all gonna dine, it's real good. You
like catfish, we got good catfish. They use
alotta butta. You like sand dabs, we
got sand dabs.
LEO MOGUY descends from the clubs prominent staircase.

MOGUY
Dr.Schultz, good to see you again.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Mr.Moguy, thank you for your assistance
in creating the opportunity for this
appointment.
Mr.MOGUY
Nonsense, it's my job.

(CON'T)









73
Mr.MOGUY

(CON'T)

(LOOKING AT

DJANGO)
.So this'is the One-Eyed Charly I've heard
so much about.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes, this is Django.. Django, this is Mr.Candie's
lawyer, Leonide'Moguy.

MOGUY
Just call me Leo. Calvin's in the billiard
room, follow me. Y'all want Coco should come
along too?
Dr.SCHULTZ
We would be quite lucky indeed if the
charming Coco cared.to follow.
Coco blushes.

MOGUY
You better watch out doctor, you gonna
steal this little pony's heart.
They walk through the club to get to the billiard room, as they do they

SAY;
Dr.SCHULTZ
How long have you been associated with
Mr.Candie?

MOGUY
Calvin and I were about eleven when we
went to boarding school together. One
could almost say, I was raised to be
Calvin's lawyer.

DJANGO
One could almost say, you a nigger.
Coco can't believe what this snappy looking cowboy nigger just said to
Mr.Moguy.

MOGUY
What did you say?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh nothing, he's just being cheeky.
Anything else about Mr.Candie I should
know before I meet him?

MOGUY
Yes, he's a bit of a Francophile.









7EF
Dr.SCHULTZ
What civilized people aren't?

MOGUY
That's why all the French ambiance. And
he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mister Candie.
Dr.Schultz says in FRENCH SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
Dr.SCHULTZ

(FRENCH)
What ever he prefers.
This stops Moguy, and he turns to warn Schultz.

MOGUY
Oh he doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.
They get to the two sliding doors that lead to the billiard room.
Moguy slides the doors open...
The party enters the billiard room.

INT - BILLIARD ROOM (CLEOPATRA CLUB) - NIGHT
Inside is Calvin Candie, his bodyguard Bartholomew (still dressed in
the ill fitting suit), and the lanky sexy Sheba.
Also, at this moment, TWO MANDINGOS are having a bloody and savage
fight to death in this closed room.
An older European looking man, who's rooting for the mandingo that
Calvin's not rooting for, is also in the room. His name is.AMERIGO

VASSEPI.
Before any introductions can be made, with his back to the new arrivals
and his eyes on the black men fighting for their life, Calvin says;

CALVIN CANDIE
Why do you want to get in the mandingo
business?
That's quite abrupt and aggressive.
Dr.Schultz says, as if he's just been massively insulted;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You don't intend to allow your 2nd...
(referring to Moguy)
.to make the proper introductions?
Without turning towards them, Candie tells Schultz;









7S

CALVIN CANDIE
Quit stalling and answer the question.
The room is quiet.
Dr.SCHULTZ
The awful truth?

(PAUSE)
I'm bored, and it seems like a good
bit of fun.
Candie takes that to heart. He'll accept it for now.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well come on over, cause we gotta us a fight
goin on that's a good bit of fun 
Dr.Schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight.
The bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one.
Schultz has schooled Django on the importance of never BREAKING
CHARACTER.' Well now the good doctor must practice what he preaches.
Which means not only must he watch. the two men beat each other to
death, he must appear to convincingly enjoy it.

CALVIN CANDIE.
The bigger nigger is mine. I just bought
him today. What's his name, Moguy?

MOGUY
Big Fred.

CALVIN CANDIE
The other nigger belongs to this disreputable
Italian gentlemen to my right. Amerigo Vassepi.

(TO AMERIGO)
What's your nigger's name?

AMERIGO
Luigi... .?
Candie looks over at Django; who doesn't walk over to watch the fight.
Instead he walks over to a bar set up in the room. A slave bartender
named, ROSCOE tends it.

CALVIN CANDIE
How 'bout you, boy? You find nigger fightin'
a good bit of fun?

DJANGO
You seen one nigger fight, ya seen 'em all.

CALVIN CANDIE
How'd you two like to try the signature drink
of the club?









79
Dr.SCHULTZ
We'd love to.

CALVIN CANDIE
(yelling to the

BARTENDER)
Roscoe, two Polynesian Pearl Divers, and
don't spare the rum.
Roscoe makes the drinks in coconut shell glasses.
Big Fred kills Luigi.
Candie and his friends cheer.

CALVIN CANDIE
Arrivederci Luigi! Well, Mr.Vassepi, looks
like you owe me ten dollars.
Amerigo pays up the puny bet.
Django and Schultz get the fancy coconut shell drinks. They both take a
sip. Schultz hates it, Django loves it.
Candle turns his attention to Django.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's your name, boy?
Dr.SCHULTZ
His name is Django.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
Where'd ya dig him up?
Dr.SCHULTZ
A fortuitous turn of events brought
Django and myself together.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO DJANGO)
I've heard tell about you. I heard you're a
real bright boy.

(BEAT)
I'm curious, what makes you such a
mandingo expert?

DJANGO
I'm curious, what makes you so curious?
Bartholomew puts down his pool cue, and turns toward Django;

BARTHOLOMEW
What you say, boy?









77
    . Candie puts a calming hand on Bartholomew's shoulder.

CALVIN CANDIE
Calm down Bartholomew, gentle... gentle.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Monsieur Candie, I would appreciate it if
you directed your line of inquiry to me.

CALVIN CANDIE
Doc, I'm a seasoned slaver, you are a
neophyte. I'm simply trying to ascertain
if this cowboy is taking advantage of you.
Dr.SCHULTZ
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie, I
didn't seek you out for your advice. I
sought you out to purchase a fighting
nigger at above top dollar market price.
I was'under the impression when you
granted me an audience, it would be to
discuss business.

CALVIN CANDIE
No we weren't talking business yet. We
were discussing my curiosity.
Now according to Moguy here, if I do
business with you...

(POINTING TO

SCHULTZ)
, .I'm doin' business with both of y'all.

(POINTING TO

DJANGO)
He does the eyeballin', you the billfold?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well you don't make it sound too flattering,
but more or less, yes.
None of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who
needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is.
Candie turns his attention back to Django.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO DJANGO)
So Bright Boy,.Moguy here tells me you
looked over my African flesh, and were
none too impressed.

FLASH ON
we see. Django looking over THREE MANDINGOS..









BACK TO CLEO CLUB

DJANGO
Not for top dollar.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well then we got nothing more to talk
about. You wanna buy a beat ass nigger
from me, those are the beat ass niggers
I wanna sell.

DJANGO
He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna
sell. He wants the nigger you don't
wanna sell.

CALVIN CANDIE
I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna
sell.
Dr.Schultz chimes in thoughtfully;-
Dr.SCHULTZ
You won't sell your best. You won't even
sell your second best. But your third
best... .you don't want to.sell him... .But if
I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be
forced to consider it... . who knows what
could happen?

CALVIN CANDIE
What do you consider ridiculous?
Dr.SCHULTZ.
For a truly talented specimen,
."The Right Nigger"..:?
How much would you say, Django?

DJANGO
Twelve thousand dollars.
Calvin Candle takes in the figure.

CALVIN CANDIE
Gentlemen, you had my curiosity. Now
you got my attention.

TIME CUT

TNT -- CLEOPATRA CLUB -- RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Candle, Moguy, Django, Schultz, Bartholomew, Sheba, and Coco eat dinner
in the restaurant. All the men eat thick T-Bones. Coco eats Catfish.
And Sheba uses her fingers to rip apart Crawdads.









77

CALVIN CANDIE
How ya like that meat, Bright Boy?
Django's eyes go to Calvin, he nods his approval.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO COCO)
How's your Catfish, dew drop?

COCO
Real good Monsieur Candie.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
You spend a lot of time around niggers
aside from Freeman here?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Not so much.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well if'in you did,.you'd know what a
treat this was for 'em. You feel special
Coco?

COCO
Yes. sir, Monsieur Candie.

CALVIN CANDIE
You feel special Bartholomew?

BARTHOLOMEW
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
He looks to Sheba, who's licking her fingers from the Crawdads.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now Sheba always feels special. Dont'cha?

SHEBA
Yep.

CALVIN CANDIE
How 'bout you Bright Boy, you feel
special?

DJANGO

(MEANING SHEBA)
Not as special as her.
The table breaks out in laughter.









CALVIN CANDIE
Well we're leaving bright and early
tomorrow morning, and moving the. whole
kit and caboodle to "Candyland."
You oughta come with us.
Dr.Schultz and Django's eyes meet for a moment.. .so far...so good.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, that wasn't on the agenda. But I
suppose I could be amenable to that.
How far must we trek?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh hardly a ride at all, We'll still be
in Chickasaw County. Five hours.. .tops.
There you can get a look at my best
specimens. Have dinner with my sister
and I. Spend the night at Candyland as
my guest.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid.
Django and Schultz trade looks and small smiles.

WE CUT

EXT - COUNTRY SIDE MISSISSIPPI - DAY
It's the next day and a whole procession is making their way to
"Candyland."
Calvin Candie, Leonide Moguy, Dr.Schultz, Django, and THREE OVERSEERS
(BILLY CRASH, TOMMY GILES, and HOOT PETERS) ride horses.
Bartholomew (now dressed in work clothes) drives a buckboard filled
with'supplies.
FIVE MANDINGOS (Big Fred and Banjo who we already met, plus JOSHUA,
SIDNEY JAMES, and TATUM) recently purchased at the Greenville Auction
walk to their new home, with small bundles of their personal
possessions under their arm. They look like powerful warriors.

THREE OTHER SHIRTLESS MANDINGOS (RODNEY, CHICKEN CHARLY, CHESTER) WHO
WERE THE MANDINGOS FROM Candyland that didn't sell at Greenville are
walking back to Candyland, with their small bundle of personal
possessions under their arms. These poor devil's know their fate is
pretty dismal. Either they'll be sold to the LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, or they'll be put in some mandingo fight they can't win, like
with Samson, or Stonesipher's dogs.









J

RODNEY
walks along the road, looks up at Django riding his horse. All the
slaves hate Django because they think he's a black slaver. But
the three heading back to Candyland are even more resentful.

FLASH ON
Django with Schultz, earlier, inspecting and rejecting these three.

RODNEY
gives Django a bad eyeball look up on his horse.

DJANGO ON TONY
sees it. He's playing the role of a fucker black slaver, he can't let
that shit stand.
He yells down to the powerless man;

DJANGO
Gotta problem with your eyeball, boy?
Rodney looks away.

RODNEY
No sir.

DJANGO
You want a boot heel in it?

RODNEY
No sir.

DJANGO
Then keep ya damn eyeballs off me!
Flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give ya reason not to like me!
As this parade makes progress, Django keeps his emotions in check, but
not without difficulty.
Dr.Schultz comes riding Fritz beside him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
How do you like this side of the slave
trade?

DJANGO
Not so much.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Prefer the other side?

DJANGO
I didn't say that.








Dr.SCHULTZ
I've confirmed Broomhilda's at Candyland.

DJANGO
Are you sure it's her?
Dr.SCHULTZ
He didn't call her by name, but she's a
young lady, whip marks on 'her back, and
speaks German. Now while it's not wise to
assume, in this instance, I think it's
pretty safe.

DJANGO
Did you offer to buy her?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I opened the door to my possible interest.
But naturally, sight unseen, I can only be
so interested.

SUDDENLY ...
Calvin Candie comes riding up behind them...

CALVIN CANDLE
Am I intruding?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Of course not.

CALVIN CANDIE

(APPRAISING THE

TWO MEN)
I swear you two are cozier then a couple
of cuttle fish.
Dr.SCHULTZ
You'd be surprised what a good
conversationalist Django is.

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh by now, I don't think that would
surprise meat all.
Candie gives Django a creepy smile.
Around now the audience may start noticing DOG BARKING in the distance.
Dr.SCHULTZ
When do we reach your property?









1?3

CALVIN CANDLE
You been on it. I own the whole sixty
miles 'fore we get to Candyland.
Candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs.

CALVIN CANDIE
Excuse me a moment, gentlemen.

(YELLING BEHIND
him at Billy)
Billy Crash, git up here!
Billy Crash, a hillbilly overseer who's missing his two front teeth,
rides up.

BILLY CRASH
Yeah, Boss?

CALVIN CANDIE
Find out what that goddamn commotion
is up at the tracker shack!

BILLY CRASH
Right away, Boss.
Billy Crash TEARS UP AHEAD on his horse.

CALVIN CANDIE
You know, confidentially, just 'tween
us girls, worse things about this
business, ain't the slaves. It's all
the white trash ya gotta deal with.
Like these peckawoods we got riding with
us. These dumb, ignorant, sleazy sonsabitches
ain't good fer nuttin, except kickin' a
niggers ass can't kick back. Yeah, they
holdin' the pretty part of the whip, but
it's just a thin membrane separate 'em.
And don't think they don't know it either.
It's about the only thing these dumbass
motherfuckers do know. But ya need 'em.
Who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a
niggers ass, other than somebody might as
well be a nigger hisself. But these mountain
boys I use as trackers for the runaways,
they the worst. Nothin but a buncha goddamn
inbreed hillbillies. Now like that nigger
gal we was talkin' 'bout. I'm sure it.was
a pain in the ass, but with a lot of
patience, that German lady taught Hildi
how to speak German.
Django hears her name himself. His head does involuntary jerk, but his
   , emotions betray nothing.









PTE

CALVIN CANDIE

(CON'T)
Now these inbred hillbillies, on the other
hand, they can barely speak English. I can't
understand a damn word most of 'em say. You
could teach a plow horse how to make a pot
of coffee, 'fore you teach those fools how
to use a knife and fork. I tell ya, if it
wasn't for catchin' a nigger on the run,
they'd be as useless as tits on a boar hog.
Billy Crash comes riding back.

CALVIN CANDIE
What the hell's goin on?

BILLY CRASH
They got 'em a runaway.

CALVIN CANDIE
Who?

CUT TO

EXT - TRACKER SHACK - DAY
A BUNKHOUSE for the FOUR HILLBILLY TRACKERS (they track down runaway
slaves) that live here about forty miles from the Candyland Plantation.
A little dog kennel, looks like a chicken coup, sits next to the
bunkhouse.
The TRACKERS are a hairy, bearded, burly, buck skinned wearing, dirty
long haired lot.
Their Leader is Mr.,STONESIPHER, the other three are STEW, LEX, and
JAKE. The four men could be brothers, or cousins, or father and sons,
or just from the same hollow.
Lex holds two SNARLING GERMAN SHEPHERDS on a leash. Stew one SNARLING
GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash. And Mr.Stonesipher holds one SNARLING
GERMAN SHEPHERD on a leash, the lead dog, that goes by the name of

MARSHA.
A runaway slave named, D'ARTAGNAN, lies belly down in the dirt,
surrounded by the four vicious dogs, who BARK, GROWL, and SNAP at him.
One look at D'Artagnan tells you he's a mandingo who's been in one
fight too many. One of his eyes have been 'poked out. Big BITES have
been bit out of both his face and neck (by past fights, human bites,
not-the dogs), as well as three fingers have been bit off. Not to
mention he's covered in cuts, like he's been drug through a briar
patch.









O V5
The fourth Tracker, JAKE, doesn't engage in the melodrama. He hangs in
the background, CUTTING FIREWOOD with a big axe.
Calvin Candie, Dr.Schultz, Django, and the whole Candie caravan look
down on the runaway slave. Including the five new mandingos, and the three
old mandingos who know D'Artagnan.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well I'll be, D'Artagnan. Now boy, why do
a fool thing like run off?

D'ARTAGNAN
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh yes you can. You might not be able to
win, but your ass can fight. - Mr.Stonesipher,
shut these goddamn dogs up, I can't hear
myself think!
Mr.Stonesipher, yells to Marsha;
Mr.STONESIPHER
Hush now! Marsha! Marsha, hush up!
Marsha, Marsha, hush up!
(to the other

TRACKERS)
Take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger,
he's just makin' em hungry.
The other two YANK the dogs away from the fallen Black Man.

CALVIN CANDIE
How long was he loose?
Mr. Stonesipher spits tobacco juice.
Mr.STONESIPHER
A.night. Day. Half the other night.

CALVIN CANDIE
How far he git off property?
Mr.STONESIPHER
Bout twenty miles off prop. Pretty fer,
considering that limp he got.

CALVIN CANDIE
Moguy, who was D'Artagnan suppose to fight
Friday?.

MOGUY
(pointing behind him)
One of this new lot.









CALVIN CANDIE
Well the way he looks now a blind Indian
wouldn't bet 'a bead on 'em.

(TO D'ARTAGNAN)
Boy, you done made yourself as useless as
a tail on a teddy bear.
D'Artagnan starts begging.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now now, no beggin', no playin' on my
soft heart. You in trouble now, son.
Now you need to understand I'm runnin' a
business. Now I done paid five hundred
dollars for you. And when I pay five
hundred dollars, I expect to get five
fights outta a nigga 'fore he roll over
and play dead. You've fought three fights.

D'ARTAGNAN
I won every one.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well, yes you did. But that last one, you
muddied the line between winning and losing.
Calvin climbs down off of his horse, and walks to the captured runaway
on the ground.

CALVIN CANDIE
But the fact remains, I pay five hundred
dollars, I want five fights. So what
about my five hundred dollars? You gonna
reimburse me?
The Whites (except for Schultz) laugh.
This whole spectacle is making Dr.Schultz sick to his stomach.
Not Django ... . he's seen this little drama play out many times before.
The three returning mandingos, Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester,
watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away.
The five new mandingos watch Calvin Candie's treatment of D'Artagnan to
know what to expect from their new home.
Bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like, poor
bastard.
Calvin prods further.

CALVIN CANDIE
You even know what reimburse means?









E 17
The Whites laugh.
Then SUDDENLY ...
.The German Speaks;
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'll reimburse you.
All eyes turn to Dr.Schultz.
Including Django's, whose eyes narrow at the doctor.
Calvin Candie uses the occasion to perform a slow dramatic turn in the
direction of the good German.

CALVIN CANDIE
You will?
Removing his long brown leather billfold from his suit jacket pocket.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes.

CALVIN CANDIE
You'll pay five hundred dollars for a
one eyed Ole'Joe, ain't fit to push a
broom?
Django's voice cuts through the Mississippi heat.

DJANGO
No he won't.
All eyes turn to Django.

DJANGO
He's just tired'of you toyin' with him is
all. And for that matter, so am I. But we
ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny,
we ain't got no use for 'em. Ain't that
right, Doc?
Dr.Schultz realizes he's just done the one thing he's always preached
to Django you can never do..BREAK CHARACTER. The doctor puts his
billfold back in his suit coat pocket.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO CANDIE)
You heard 'em.
The Hillbilly Trackers stare up at the black man on the horse in the
green jacket, slack jawed.
!  Even the one chopping wood in the BG stops his chopping.









CALVIN CANDIE
You'll hafta excuse Mr.Stonesipher's slack
jawed gaze. He ain't never seen a nigger
like you ever in his life..Ain't that right,
Mr. Stonesipher?
Mr.. Stonesipher., SPITS.
Mr.STONESIPHER
That's right.
Calvin steps up to Django on his horse. Looking up at the black man,
Calvin challenges Django to a staring contest.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well now since you won't pay a penny for
this pickaninny, you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger however I see fit?

DJANGO
He's your nigger.

CALVIN CANDIE
Mr.Ston.esipher... .let Marsha and her
bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
Mr.STONESIPHER
Marsha...git 'em!
The other Trackers let loose of the leashes holding the German
Shepherds back.
The DOGS CHARGE towards D'Artagnan on his knees...

THE MANDINGOS
all react to the sight of the dogs being let loose.
The DOGS ATTACK D'ARTAGNAN ...
As we HEAR the ATTACK ...
Candie.staring contest with Django...
Django, who expected nothing less and has seen worse, doesn't blink as
the runaway slave is torn to bits by canine teeth ...
The other Mandingos are scared sick at what they see.
The Hillbilly Trackers root the dogs on.
Dr.Schultz has never seen a man torn apart by dogs before, and he
appears not to enjoy it.
Calvin, without blinking, shifts his eyes toward Dr.Schultz, then back
   -. to Django.









P9

CALVIN CANDIE
Your boss looks a little green around
the gills for a blood sport like
nigger fightin'?
As D'Artagnan's SCREAMS and Marsha's GROWLS continue OFF SCREEN.

DJANGO
Naw, he just ain't use to seein' a man
ripped apart by dogs, is all.

CALVIN CANDIE
But you are use to it?

DJANGO
Well, him bein' German an' all, I'm
a little more use to American's then
he is. Now Monsieur Candie, whenever you're
ready, we rode five hours so you could
show off your stock. Let's git to it.
Cause as of now, if he's a example, I'
ain't impressed.
Calvin...BLINK...
Saying nothing, Monsieur Candie turns his back to Django, climbs up on
his horse, then looks at the black man.

CALVIN CANDIE
Follow me.
The whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear D'Artagnan
apart.

EXT - THE GROUNDS OF CANDYLAND - DAY
The caravan starts to approach Candyland. Calvin Candie and his sister
own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of Mississippi.
As the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton, and fields of SLAVES
picking it.
The audience might of been expecting Candyland to be a hell on earth,
Auschwitz, Andersonville, Yuma Prison, a Mexican prison in a Sergio
Corbucci Spaghetti western ...
INSTEAD ... . CANDYLAND is very beautiful. The fields of cotton, the way
the trees hang green vines over everything. It's full of nature and
natures vibrant colors, and a broiling hot sun to see it all in.
One of the cottonpickers in the field, DOBIE, looks up, and sees Django
in his cool green corduroy jacket, badass cowboy hat, on top of Tony.
He taps the shoulder of another cotton picker (ORWELL), and points out
Django.









90
All of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field, straighten up to
get a better look at the black riding a horse.
Django looks back matching their stare.

EXT - SLAVE VILLAGE - DAY
The caravan rolls through the shack cabin village the slaves live in.
As the parade rolls through all the SLAVES snap to attention, and bow
(very formally) as Monsieur Candie rides past. A KING among his SUBJECTS,
a PATRON with his PEONS, a FATHER amongst his CHILDREN, a SHEPHERD
among his SHEEP.
KIDS playing in the dirt get up and run to Calvin on his horse.
Candie calls the kids by name, takes out a bag of jelly beans, and
begins tossing them about.
The Kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy.
This is Calvin Candie in his element, at his happiest.

THEN ...
.DJANGO rides by.
The CARAVAN moves from the slave village to the White Village the
overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds.
Other then the switch of white faces for black, it's pretty much the
same village.
And they too see Django ... . WOW!
The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the Plantation,
or The Big House as everyone calls it.
To the left of the Big House is big wooden ARENA built for his Friday
night nigger fights.
All the HOUSE SLAVES (the domestic slaves that work for the Candie
family in the Big House), and WHITE WORKERS (overseers and stray farm
hands) come out to greet the caravan.
They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie, who naturally leads the
procession, as if he's Alexander The Great returning from the wars.
As the caravan comes to a stop in front of the Big House, it creates a
huge dust cloud behind it.
Calvin's widowed sister LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLY, an attractive
   . fortyish, strawberry blonde southern belle, steps out on the porch of
the Big House to greet her brother.








Directly above Lara Lee, on the third floor balcony over hang, out.
steps...

STEPHEN
eyeing Calvin and the approaching caravan.
Who's STEPHEN? Stephen is a very old black man, who with his bald pate,
and tufts of white curly hair on the sides, looks like a character out
of Dickens - if Dickens wrote about House Niggers in the Antebellum
South. -
Stephen has been Calvin's slave since he was a little boy. And in
(almost) every way is the 2nd most powerful person at Candyland.
Like the characters Basil Rathbone would play in swashbucklers, evil,
scheming, intriguing men, always trying to influence and manipulate power
for their own self interest. Well that describes Stephen to a tee.
The Basil Rathbone of House Niggers.
The old Man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach.

THEN...
Out of the dust cloud ...EMERGE DJANGO and SCHULTZ... . on TONY and FRITZ.
All the Candylanders see Django, dressed like he is, up on the horse,
and for a moment don't know what to think.
Lara Lee, like her brother, is both surprised and intrigued.
As Stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket,
it's hate at first sight. Stephen heads downstairs, he walks with a,
limp.
All the caravan riders are still up on their horses. Calvin sees
Stephen limping towards them, and greets him with a big how do you do;

CALVIN CANDIE
Hello Stephen my boy!

STEPHEN
Yeah yeah yeah, hello my ass - who's
this nigger up on that nag?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh Stephen, why so ornery, you miss me?

STEPHEN
Yeah, I miss you like I miss.a rock in my
shoe. Like I said, who's this nigger, up
on that nag?

DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
Hey Snowball.








: Stephen looks up at Django on Tony.

DJANGO
If you wanna know who I am, or the name of
my horse, you ask me.

STEPHEN
Just'who the hell you callin' Snowball,
horse boy? I'll yank your ass of that
goddamn'nag, so goddamn fast - in the mud.

CALVIN CANDIE
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Stephen, let's keep it
funny. Django's a Freeman.
Stephen jerks a thumb up towards Django.

STEPHEN
This nigger, here?

CALVIN CANDIE
That nigger there. Let me at least introduce
the two of. you. Django, this is another
cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
Stephen, this is Django. You two should
hate each other.
Stephen uses'the special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst the
blacks at Candyland.

STEPHEN
Calvin, who the hell is this nigger you
feel the need to entertain?

CALVIN CANDIE
Django and his friend in grey, Dr.Schultz
are customers, and they are our guests
Stephen. And you - you old decrepit bastard...
.are to show them every hospitality.
Do you understand that?

STEPHEN
I don't know why I gotta -

CALVIN CANDIE
You don't hafta know why, do you
understand?

STEPHEN
Yeah yeah yeah, I understand just fine.

CALVIN CANDIE
Good. They're spending the night. Go up
in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.









93

STEPHEN

(POINTING AT

DJANGO)
He's gonna stay in the Big House?

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, he's a slaver. It's different.

STEPHEN

(INCREDULOUS)
In the Big House?

CALVIN CANDIE
You gotta problem with that?

STEPHEN
I don't gotta problem, unless you gotta
problem with burin' the bed, the sheets,
and the pillow cases once this black ass
motherfuckers gone!

CALVIN CANDIE
That's my problem, they're mine to burn.
Your problem, right now, is making a
good impression. And I want you to start
solving that problem right now, and git
them rooms ready.
The Old Man looks up at his Master, and says;

STEPHEN
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.
Stephen limps away to the guest rooms, muttering to'himself.
Lara Lee and her ever present shadow, a FAT MAMMY named CORA, comes up
to her brother on his horse.

CALVIN CANDIE
Dr.Schultz, this attractive southern belle
is my widowed sister, may I present to you,
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
Lara Lee does a southern lady bow.
Dr.Schultz lifts his bowler hat, and nods in a grand manner.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I am Dr.King Schultz, this is my 2nd
Django,
(Django tips his hat)
and these are our horses, Fritz and Tony.
Both Fritz and Tony do the head bow.








Dr.SCHULTZ
And it is our great delight to encounter
this flaming rose.

LARA LEE
Well aren't you the charming gentlemen.
You're not from around here, are you?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Actually I'm from a far off land,
Dusseldorf, to be exact.

CALVIN CANDIE
These two are in the market for a fightin'
nigger. So I thought I'd invite 'em down,
show 'em my stock.

LARA LEE
We'll all have dinner tonight, right?

CALVIN CANDIE
Half the reason I invited them. I thought
you'd find.them as intriguing as I do
little sister.
Lara Lee looks up at Django, and smiles.
All of a sudden THREE WHITE RIDERS ride up on horses, a older one, and
two tough looking younger ones. The'older one is the Cap't of the
Overseers, ACE WOODY, and his two assistants BROWN and JINGLE BELLS
CODY. While Ace is dressed for work on a farm, both Brown and Jingle
Bells Cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits.
As Calvin Candie watches the three riders approach, he turns to
Dr.Schultz and Django, and says;

CALVIN CANDIE
You know since I started fightin' niggers
about eleven years ago, it's been a new
lease on'life. And the man ridin' up here
now is the man responsible for all my
success.
Ace and his boys pull their horses up, kicking up dust.
Through the dust Ace, Brown, and Jingle Bells Cody eyeball Django and
Schultz.

CALVIN CANDIE
Howdy Ace.

(TO SCHULTZ

AND DJANGO)
This here is my Overseer .Cap't, and
nigger fight trainer extraordinaire,
Ace Woody.









915
Pointing at the two shadows that flank Ace Woody.

CALVIN CANDIE
And that's Brown and that's Jingle Bells
Cody.

(TO ACE)
Ace, this here is Dr.Ring Schultz, and
Django Freeman, they're big customers with
big pockets wanna buy a big nigger. So I
brought 'em out here so you could give
'em a little display of our African flesh.
Ace takes off his hat, bows from his horse, welcoming them.

ACE WOODY
Welcome to Candyland, gentlemen.
Astride their horses Brown and Jingle Bells Cody just make faces at
Django.
Ace's attention goes to the five new mandingos.just walked from
Greenville to here.

ACE WOODY
These the new chickens?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes siree bob.

ACE WOODY
How many you get?

(HE COUNTS)
One, two, three, four, five.

CALVIN CANDIE
Five real strong bucks.

ACE WOODY
How many you get rid of?

CALVIN CANDIE
We still got three left.
Ace looks to see who came back from the auction.
Leo Moguy chimes in;

MOGUY
I already wired the LeQuint Dickey people,
they'll be here tomorrow.
Ace turns to Brown.









ACE WOODY
Get 'em away from the others. Put 'em in
the pen till tomorrow.
Brown with his horse, yells, chases, and herds the three men away into
the slave pen.
Ace yells from his horse down to the five new mandingo arrivals, Big
Fred, Banjo, Sidney James, Tatum,.and Joshua.

ACE WOODY
Y'all stand over there and make a line!
They do.
Ace climbs down from off his horse.
Cody stays in his saddle, circling the black men with his horse.
Everybody, including Django and Dr.Schultz, watch the show.
Ace'Woody walks up and down the line looking at the new men.
Candie, sitting comfortably up on his horse, says;

CALVIN CANDIE
What do you think?

ACE WOODY
I think you lookin' for niggers to push
a plow, 'dem your boys.
Candie rolls his eyes.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's wrong with them?

ACE WOODY
Hold it...hold it, you done bought
r em, let me look at 'em.
Unimpressed Ace Woody continues to examine them.

ACE WOODY
Okay, how 'bout that one, did you
buy that one?

CALVIN CANDIE
Which one?

ACE WOODY
What you mean, which one? The one I'm
pointing at, that one.









77

CALVIN CANDIE
Actually, that one was purchased by
our mister Moguy.

ACE WOODY

(TO MOGUY)
You bought him?

MOGUY
Yes I did.

ACE WOODY
Why?

MOGUY
I like his prospects.

ACE WOODY
His prospects? Now you know Mr..Moguy,
I ain't a educated fella like yourself.
Remind me again what prospects means?

MOGUY
Hope for the future.
Jerking a thumb towards the slave in question.

ACE WOODY
You got hope for his future?

MOGUY
I did.

ACE WOODY
Well I don't.
Ace walks over to the slave in question.

ACE WOODY
What's your name, boy?
The mandingo says;

SIDNEY JAMES
Sidney James, sir.

ACE WOODY
So long Sidney James.
Ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip, and SHOOTS
Sidney James point blank in the belly.
Everybody reacts.








Especially the four other mandingos standing next to him.
Sidney James rolls in the dirt, screaming and holding his bleeding gut.
Till Cody puts a bullet in his head, putting him out of his misery.
Moguy, shakes his head, "Typical," he thinks.
Django and Schultz, on their horses next. to Candid, watch.
Ace looks up at his boss.

ACE WOODY
Boss Candie, which one did you buy?

CALVIN CANDIE
Well to me the pick of the litter is
Big Fred over there.

ACE WOODY

(POINTING AT

FRED)
This one over here?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes.

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
You Fred?
A very scared Fred answers.

BIG FRED
Yes, sir.

ACE WOODY
Well good to meet'cha Fred, I'm'Ace Woody,
I'm a man of influence 'round here. Now
Fred am I mistaken, or were you already in
a kurfuffle?

CALVIN CANDIE
I had 'em fight one of Amerigo's niggers
last night.

'ACE WOODY
How is of Amerigo?

CALVIN CANDIE
His nigger lost.









99

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
Really? You won?

BIG FRED
Yes, sir.

ACE WOODY
Wup'ed his ass?

CALVIN CANDIE
Beat 'em to death.
Smiling impressively at Big Fred.

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
Really?

CALVIN CANDIE
He did have fifteen pounds on 'em,
but still, he still beat his ass
to death.

ACE WOODY

(TO FRED)
You did?

BIG FRED)
Yes, sir.

ACE WOODY
Good job, boy. Got any more wins in ya?

BIG FRED
Yes, sir.
Ace gives Cody a slight head nod, and Cody SHOOTS Big Fred in the back.
Candie acts out mock frustration.
The remaining three mandingos jump a mile.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now why did you do that?

ACE WOODY
He won his last fight last night.
Ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos









1 00

ACE WOODY

(TO MANDINGOS)
Those of you with exceptional ability
will find it ain't so bad here. Those of
you who don't possess exceptional ability,
will wish you did.
Ace looks up to Cody on his horse.

ACE WOODY
Run 'em over to the Arena. Git 'em doin
push ups. First one gives out, shoot 'em
in the head.

(TO MANDINGOS)
Welcome to Candyland, boys!
Cody runs the terrified mandingos to the arena.
Candie leans over to Schultz and says;

CALVIN CANDLE
We only get about two out of every batch
of five fighters we buy. But those two
tend to be lucky.
Ace Woody hops back up on his horse.

CALVIN CANDIE
You know Mr.Woody, I'm beginning to think
that you don't trust my judgement?
Ace Woody just smiles at his boss, and says;

ACE WOODY
Oh you know I always trust your judgement,
Boss Candie...eventually.
He rides off.
Stephen limps back to the action.

CALVIN CANDIE
Ahhh, Stephen my boy, rooms ready?

STEPHEN
All ready for your guest and his nigger.
Candie'shakes his head in mock frustration.

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you're incorrigible.

(TO SCHULTZ

AND DJANGO)
Gentlemen, let Stephen show you to your
rooms.









 O 

CALVIN CANDLE

(CON'T)
There you can lie down and rest up
for a couple of hours. Then we'll have
some lemonade, and I'll show off some of
my finer specimens.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Splendid.
Both Dr.Schultz and Django climb down from their horses.
Candie looks to a black little stable boy of about eight named TIMMY.

CALVIN CANDIE
Timmy boy, go take their horses for 'em.
Fix 'em up at the stable, give 'em a load
of oats.
Django hands the boy the reigns.

DJANGO
That's Fritz, this is Tony. You take good
care of 'em now.

TIMMY
Yes, sir.
Django takes an apple out of his saddle bag, and hands it to the boy.

DJANGO
Once he's in the stable, give 'em that.
He reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one.

DJANGO
Give that one to Fritz.
Timmy leads the horses away.
The two visitors start to follow Stephen to their rooms, when
Dr.Schultz pretends to remember something;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Oh, Monsieur Candie, about that matter about
the nigger girl we were talking about?

CALVIN CANDIE
Nigger girl?
Dr.SCHULTZ
I believe you said she spoke German?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh Yes, Hildi, what about her?








,oz.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Do you think before the demonstration you
could send her around to my room?

CALVIN CANDIE
I don't see why not.

(TO STEPHEN)
Stephen, when you get through showing
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi.
I want her cleaned up and smellin' nice,
and sent over to Dr.Schultz's room.
Stephen has to be the bearer of bad news.

STEPHEN
Actually... . Monsieur Candie... . there's
somethin' we ain't tole you yet.

CALVIN CANDIE
What?

STEPHEN
Hildi's in The Hot Box.
This gets Django's, Schultz's, and Candie's attention.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's she doin' there?

STEPHEN
What 'cha think she doin' in The Hot Box,
she bein punished.

CALVIN CANDIE
What she do?

STEPHEN
She ran away again.

CALVIN CANDIE
Jesus Christ, how many people ran away
when I was gone?

STEPHEN
Two.

CALVIN CANDIE
When did she go?

STEPHEN
Last night. They brought her back this
morning.









CALVIN CANDLE
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?
Django's hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon. If they sicked
those dogs on his angel, he's going to just kill all these
motherfuckers right now.

STEPHEN
Lucky for her they were busy lookin' for
D'Artagnan's ass. Brown and Cody went out
lookin' for her and found her. She a little
beat up, but she did that to herself.
Runnin' through them damn bushes.
Django's hand moves away from his gun.

CALVIN CANDIE
How long she been in the box?

STEPHEN
What'cha think, all goddamn day! Little
fool got ten more days to go.

CALVIN CANDLE
Take her out.

STEPHEN

(INCREDULOUS)
Take her out? Why!

CALVIN CANDLE
Because I said so, that's why. Hildi is
my nigger. Dr.Schultz is my guest. Southern
hospitality dictates I make her available
to him.

STEPHEN
But Monsieur Candie, she just ran away?

CALVIN CANDLE
Jesus Christ Stephen, what's the point of
havin' a nigger speaks German if-you can't
wheel 'em out when you have a German guest?
I realize it's inconvenient. Still, take
her out.
(to Cora and

LARA LEE)
Lara Lee would you and Cora be responsible
for getting her cleaned up and presentable
for Dr.Schultz?
The overseers,'Tommy Giles and Hoot Peters go to The Hot.Box. While
Billy Crash goes to the well to draw a bucket of water.








Django watches them walk to The Hot Box.
Dr.Schultz's eyes shift to Django, to watch him watch this.
Stephen notices Django's interest in both The Hot Box and whoever's
sizzling in it.
The HOT BOX
itself is a large IRON SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CELL DOOR (from Yuma
Prison) built into the ground. They put a key in the lock, and the two
men lift the heavy iron door open.
REVEALING: A naked Broomhilda broiling in a small coffin like iron box
dug into the ground.
Broomhilda reacts to the sudden burst of blinding sunshine.

WHEN ...
Billy Crash TOSSES the bucket of water on her.
Django watches this.
DJANGO'S POV:.From his wide shot perspective we see them yank the NAKED
BROOMHILDA (incoherent) out of the hole.

REVENGE MUSIC PLAYS
as we move into a Sergio Leone CU of DJANGO'S FACE.
Stephen breaks the mood.

STEPHEN

(TO DJANGO)
You comin', or you wanna sleep in that
little box?
Django turns his back on the naked Broomhilda and follows Stephen and
Dr.Schultz up the front steps of The Big House.

INT - THE BIG HOUSE - DAY
Stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in
the entry way of The Big House. Then down the hallway with the guest
rooms. Dr.Schultz is shown his guest room by Stephen. Schultz enters
the room and shuts the door behind him. Stephen takes Django to the
room next door, opens the door, and leads him in.

INT - DJANGO'S GUEST ROOM - DAY
A guest room with a big feather bed, dresser drawer with a flowery
pitcher of water and basin on top of it. A little bedside table with a
lamp and a tiny bell on it.









105

STEPHEN
This one's yours, boy. That bed's damn
nice too.
Django walks over to the window, parts the curtains and peers out.
Broomhilda's gone. As he looks through the glass, snotty Stephen
rattles on in the background.

STEPHEN
Feel free to touch anything you want,
cause we burnin' all this shit once you
gone. I'll have somebody knock on the
door when the demonstration ready.
Django sits down on the bed.
Stephen turns to leave.

DJANGO
Not so fast.

STEPHEN
I got more important things to do then
jaw with you.

DJANGO
Nigger, when I say stop you plant roots.
Both the words and the tone stop Stephen dead. He turns around.

DJANGO
This tiny bell on this little table...
.is this for you? I ring this, you
do fer me?

STEPHEN
Me or somebody.
Django reaches over and picks up the bell.
(a soft) DING-A-LING

STEPHEN

(UNAMUSED)
What 'cha want?

DJANGO
I want you to pour some water in that
bowl for my wash up.
Stephen does what he's told, but with attitude.









)O'
Django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone.
Once Stephen's done, Django stands up from the bed.

DJANGO
Gimmie.
Stephen hands him the basin full of water.
Django takes it from him.
Then throws the water in Stephen's face.
The dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man.

DJANGO
Whatsamatter Stephen, you don't like
that?
Django takes his hand and SLAPS the old man hard across the face
knocking him to the floor;

DJANGO
That's my kinda bell ringin'. Git up.
The old man timidly, slowly, and shaky rises off the floor - as soon as
he does - Django SLAPS HIM TO THE FLOOR again.
Then Django sits back down on the bed, looking at the old man on the
floor below his knees.

DJANGO
I've known me House Niggers like you my
whole life. Play your dog tricks with your
Massa'. Ya' lip off to him every now an'
then, as long as ya' keep it funny. He
rolls his eyes and puts up with it, and
all the white folks think it's so cute.
Meanwhile you got all these niggas round
here hoppin' and jumpin' to stay on your
good side. Well this time Snowball, you
gonna listen to me. You got anymore sass
you wanna sling my way, before they give
us a mandingo demonstration, I'm gonna
give this whole motherfuckin plantation
a demonstration, of ME beatin' the BLACK
off your ass. I will make you drop your
drawers, I'll take off my belt, and I will
Wup' your bare ass with it, in front of
every nigga on this plantation. And after
I do that, let's see you play the rooster
round here.









X07

STEPHEN
Calvin wouldn't. let you do it.

DJANGO
Oh that's right, he gives you first name
privileges... . ain't that cute. Sass me
me again nigger, see what happen'.
Stephen lying on the floor, bites his tongue.

DJANGO
That's what I thought. Now git outta"here.
With as much dignity as he can muster, Stephen stands up.
Before he leaves, Django tells him;,

DJANGO
When I ring this bell, you better come
a runnin'. You - not nobody else. While
I'm on this property, you my nigger
Snowball.
Stephen leaves.
Django lies down on the bed. He covers his eyes with his arm.
A door joins Django and Schultz's room. The adjoining door opens, and
Schultz stands there.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Was that wise?
Django doesn't remove his arm from.his eyes.

DJANGO
He ain't tellin' nobody 'bout that.
That's all that needs to be said.

INT - HALLWAY (BIG HOUSE) - DAY
Lara Lee, Cora, and a traumatized, but cleaned up (she's dressed in a
domestic maid uniform) Broomhilda stand outside Dr.Schultz's door,
after Calvin's sister raps on it.
Dr.Schultz opens the door.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Hello ladies.









DOG

LARA LEE
Dr.Schultz, may I introduce to you,
Hildi. Hildi, this is Dr.Schultz, he
speaks German.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO BROOMHILDA)
I've been informed you do as well.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
It would be my, pleasure to speak with you
in German.
Schultz acts for the benefit of Miss Lara's astonishment.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Astonishing.

(IN GERMAN)
Please come inside Fraulein.
She does, and just'as Lara Lee is to say something, Schultz says,
"Thank You very much," and closes the door in her face. Miss Lara looks
to her Mammy, and the two women head off nonplussed.

INT - SCHULTZ'S GUEST ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - LATE AFTERNOON
With the door closed, Schultz turns to the weak, frightened,
disoriented girl.
He gives her a pleasant smile.
Dr.SCHULTZ
They call you Hildi, but your real name
is Broomhilda, isn't it?

BROOMHILDA
Yes. How do you know that?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Stands to reason who ever taught you
German would also give you a German name.
Can I pour you a glass of water,
Broomhilda?
Hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile, not
to mention with a German accent, does have a bit of a calming influence
on the frightened girl.









107

WE CUT TO DJANGO
on the other side of the adjoining door, listening, waiting for his cue
to present himself.
BACK TO BROOMHILDA AND Dr.SCHULTZ
As Dr.Schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water, he begins
talking to her in GERMAN SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
I'm aware you haven't spoken German in
a long while. So I'll talk slowly.
I'm only speaking German to you now,
Broomhilda, in case Candie's people are
listening to us. Myself and a mutual
friend of ours, have gone through a lot
of trouble, and rode a lot of miles, to
find you fraulein - to rescue you.
He hands her a tall clear glass of water.
She looks at him weird, rescue me?
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Please drink.
She absentmindedly obeys.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(.GERMAN).
Now it's myself and our mutual friend's
intention to take you away from here
forever.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
I don't got any friends.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Yes you do.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
Who?
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
I can't tell you. Our mutual friend has a
flair for the dramatic, and he wants to
surprise you.









!!0

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
Where is he?
He points at the adjoining door.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Standing right behind that door.
Her head moves in the direction of the door.
He looks to the young woman;
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Promise me you won't scream?
She nods her head, yes.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(GERMAN)
Say, I promise.

BROOMHILDA

(GERMAN)
I promise.
Dr.Schultz moves to the door, and lightly raps on it.
The door knob turns.
The door slowly opens revealing...
Her husband Django, but different, all cowboyed out and cleaned up.
He smiles at her, and says;

DJANGO
Hey Little Trouble Maker.
Obviously a pet name between them.
Broomhilda goes into a bit of shock...
.first she loses strength in her wrist, so the glass tips over, and
the water spills on the floor ...
.followed quickly by herself spilling on the floor in a dead. faint.









1 1
The two men look at the woman on the floor, then at each other;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You silver tongued devil you.

MONTAGE
WE DISSOLVE to later, as we see Dr.Schultz and Django explain what-
they're doing there, who they're pretending to be, and what their plan
is to Broomhilda. We hear a woman whistle a soft pretty tune on the
soundtrack. It's not a happy tune.. .per se. But it's pretty, and
vaguely optimistic ...
WE DISSOLVE TO The SLAVE PEN
The doomed men who didn't sell at Greenville, brooding Rodney and
Chester and Chicken Charly, spend their last night at Candyland
sleeping under the stars in The Slave Pen. The same whistling tune
continues over this scene.
Rodney sees, The whole slave selling and buying group, Django,
Dr.Schultz, Candie, Bartholomew, Moguy, Ace Woody, Brown and Cody, and
the Overseers, walk across the plantation grounds on their way to
The Arena. Laughin' and joshin' all the way. The hatred Rodney feels
for that group of men burns inside him like a red hot poker.
A study in powerless fury.

DISSOLVE TO BROOMHILDA SETTING THE DINNER TABLE
in the dining room of The Big House with its knives, spoons and forks.
She's all by herself as she goes through this duty.
The whistling tune we've been listening to has been coming from
Broomhilda whistling as she sets the table.
Suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears Stephen.

STEPHEN
What you. whistlin', girl?
Broomhilda stops whistling and spins surprised in Stephen's direction.

STEPHEN
What was you whistlin'?

BROOMHILDA
Oh nuttin'.

STEPHEN
You weren't whistlin' nothin', you were
whistlin' somethin'. What'cha whistlin'?

BROOMHILDA
I dunno. Somethin' I heard. I don't know
no.name.









) Z

STEPHEN
It's kinder pretty.
She doesn't say anything in return.

STEPHEN
That was a compliment.

BROOMHILDA
Thank you.
Stephen steps out of the shadows into the light closer to Broomhilda.

STEPHEN
I'm just sayin', two days ago you wus' in
such misery here, you hadda run off. So you
run off, we catch your ass an' drag you back.
Then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in
The Hot Box for' 'bout ten hours. Now here
you are two days later, whistlin' while you
work. I'm just sayin', I.wouldn' think you'd
have a hellva lot to whistle 'bout.
.I'm jus' sayin'.
He watches the effect his words have on Broomhilda's face.

BROOMHILDA
I'm done here, may I be excused?

STEPHEN
Yes you may.
She moves off to another part of the house.
He watches her shuffle off.

INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
Later that evening, Django and a lot of other white people (Calvin
Candie, Lara Lee, Moguy, and Dr.Schultz) sat around the dinner table.
They are being served by the black people we've come to know at
Candyland (Stephen, Cora, and because Dr.Schultz likes her Broomhilda).
Along with an army of DOMESTIC SLAVES acting as wait service.
Knowing Django's a slaver, and for his dinner table privileges, the
Domestic Slaves despise Django.
Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver, even
though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade.
We pick up the conversation in mid-negotiation.









"5.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Look Monsieur Candle, they were all fine
specimens, no doubt about it. But the
best three, by far, were Sampson, Goldie,
and Eskimo Joe. - By the way, why's he
called Eskimo Joe?

CALVIN CANDIE
Oh you never know how these nigger nicknames
get started. His name was Joe-...maybe one
day he said he was cold.. .who knows?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Irregardless, we all know Samson's your
best, and you'll never sell him and I can
see why, he's a champion.

CALVIN CANDIE
All three are champions.
Django contradicts, as he chews his steak;

DJANGO
Samson's the champion. The other two
are pretty good.
All the Domestic Slaves around the table STIFFEN at witnessing Django
contradict Calvin Candie.
Including Broomhilda, who's wielding the Gravy Boat. After Django says
that, while in shock, she over pours beef gravy on Lara Lee's mashed
potatoes.

LARA LEE
Hildi!
Broomhilda snaps back.
Instead of getting angry, Candle seems to reflect on that analysis,
then issues his own appraisal;

CALVIN CANDIE
Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson, no. Can he
take Goldie, probably not - Goldie's the
best dirty fightin' nigger I ever saw. But as
long as you don't put 'em up against those
two., Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass.

DJANGO
Maybe.
The Domestics FREEZE for a jerky second when Django says that.









  

F
Dr.SCHULTZ
You must understand, Monsieur Candie, while
admittedly a .neophyte in the nigger fight
game, I do have a bit of a background in
the European traveling circus. Hence, I
have big ideas when it comes to presentation.
I need something more then just a big nigger.
He needs to have panache. A sense of showmanship.
I want to be able to . bill. him as. The Black Hercules.
I said., and I quote; "I would pay top dollar
for the, right nigger." Now I'm not saying
Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger - per se ...
but is he right as rain ... ?
Everyone waits for Calvin's response. He milks the moment by taking a
sip of his mint julep, then says;

CALVIN CANDIE
Dr.Schultz, i will have you know, there
is no one in the nigger fight game that
appreciates the value of showmanship
more then, Monsieur Calvin J. Candie. But
one must not forget the most important
thing in the nigger fight game.

(BEAT)
A nigger that can win fights. That should
be your first, second, third, four, and
fifth concern. After you have that, and
you know you have that, then, you can
start to implement a grande design. But
since I enjoy oldest man 'at the table
status - beating Moguy by one year for
that honor allow the old sage to advise,
first things first.
Broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans.
Dr.Schultz says something pleasant to her in German..
She smiles, and says something pleasant back.

CALVIN CANDIE
I see you two gettin' on?
Dr.Schultz breaks into a wide grin;
Dr.SCHULTZ
.Famously.

(DRAMATIC PAUSE)
Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what
it's like not to hear you native tongue
for four years.

CALVIN CANDIE
Hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.









  5
Everybody at the table chuckles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I can't express the joy I felt conversing
in my mother tongue. And Broomhilda is a
charming conversation companion.
As Broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for Moguy, Lara Lee notices
how Django and Broomhilda look and try not to look at each other.
Stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for Monsieur Candie.

LARA LEE
I don't know doctor, you can lay on all
the German sweet talk you want, but it
looks like this ponys got big eyes for
Django.
Lara Lee has no idea how right she is, but when she said it, all three,
Django, Broomhilda, and Schultz, involuntarily jerk.

AND ...
.STEPHEN sees it.
Schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook.
Except for Stephen, no one else was the wiser.
Broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the
kitchen.
Stephen watches her go, then looks at Django, then hands Candie his
mint julep, and goes into a broad routine for the table's benefit.

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you're amazing. I haven't finished
a drink in this house in twenty years.

STEPHEN
When a man likes a cold drink, a man likes
a COLD drink.
Chuckle... . chuckle...

CALVIN CANDIE
Did you overhear that joke I said about
me spending two weeks in Boston

STEPHEN

(MOCK INDIGNANT)
You don't have any idea the work I do
to see food gets on the table.









1 6

CALVIN CANDIE
What does that hafta do with the price of
Tea in China?

STEPHEN
You think when I'm in that kitchen, I got
nothin' better to do then listen in here
to you tellin' unfunny jokes?
Chuckle... . chuckle...

CALVIN CANDIE

(MOCK INDIGNATION)
What? They laughed!

STEPHEN
Of course they laughed, their parents
raised them right. When they're a guest
in somebody's house, and the master of
of the house thinks he's- funny, you
suppose to laugh. They'd be rude not to.
Chuckle... .chuckle...
They play their little comedy routine for all it's worth.

CALVIN CANDIE
No it was really funny,

(TO TABLE)
wasn't it?

STEPHEN
Now what do you expect these people to
say? What you need to do is stop
embarrassing your guest.

(TO TABLE)
Everybody don't laugh at him, you're being
polite, I understand, you mean well, but
it just encourages him.
Chuckle-chuckle...
As the white folks chuckle, Stephen moves back into the kitchen.

TNT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
Once Stephen enters the kitchen, his smile melts away, and he locks
eyes on Broomhilda. He moves over to her.

STEPHEN
You know that nigger?
     She spins around.









11 7

BROOMHILDA   
Who?

STEPHEN
Don't stall me bitch, you know who?

BROOMHILDA
At the table? I don't know him.

STEPHEN.
You don't know him?

BROOMHILDA
No.

STEPHEN
You wouldn't lie to me now, would you?
She shakes her head, no.
Stephen looks at her skeptical.

STEPHEN
Okay, if you say so.

BACK TO DINNER TABLE
Pick it up again in mid-negotiation.

DJANGO
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt
about it. But if it was my money, I
wouldn't pay twelve thousand dollars
for him.
Dr.SCHULTZ
What would your price be?

DJANGO
Well, if I ,was inclined to be generous,.
and I don't know why I would be inclined
to be generous... . nine thousand ... . maybe.
Candie's lawyer chimes in.

MOGUY
But the real question is, not how much
he cost, but how much he can earn?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Django?

DJANGO
In a years time, seven or eight fights -
outside of Mississippi - where his Candyland
pedigree weren't well known - Virginia...

(CON'T)









11Y

DJANGO

(CON'T)
Georgia -- all goes well ...twenty to twenty
one thousand dollars.

CALVIN CANDIE
Precisely Bright Boy, good on ya. Any way
you cut that cake, that spells profit.
Not to, mention a years worth of action at
the big table in a blood sport with a
winner nigger. However let me reclarify
how this whole negotiation came about.
It wasn't me who came to you to sell a
nigger, it was you who approached me to
buy one. Now that nine thousand dollar
figure Bright Boy was banding about,
ain't too far off from right. And if I
wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I
could sell 'em any day of the week.
But like you said in Greenville doctor,
I don't wanna sell 'em. It was only your
ridiculous offer of twelve thousand
dollars that would make me consider it.
Dr.Schultz considers'Calvin Candie's words, then suddenly says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
You know Monsieur Candie... . you do possess
the power of persuasion.
Candie smiles at that remark.
Then SUDDENLY Schultz SLAPS the table hard with his hand, and says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
Why not! Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,
Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!
The White people at the table get very happy.
Dr.Schultz continues;
Dr.SCHULTZ
However, that is a tremendous amount of
money. And the way you have your Mr.Moguy,
I have a lawyer, a persnickety man named
Tuttle. And I would need my man to draw
up a legal contract before I would feel
comfortable exchanging that amount of
money for flesh. Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my
choosing. So say I return in about five
days time with my Mr.Tuttle. And then my
Mr.Tuttle and your Mr.Moguy can hash out
the finer points between themselves.









117

CALVIN CANDIE
Splendid.

(CALLING TO

THE KITCHEN)
Stephen, time for dessert!
Stephen, Cora, Broomhilda, and the other Domestics come out of the
kitchen to clear away the dirty dishes.
Broomhilda goes to Calvin.

BROOMHILDA
Can I take away your dishes, Monsieur Candle?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes you may, Hildi.
She begins gathering the dirty dishes.
Candie looks up at her as she works.

CALVIN CANDIE
So Hildi, how you like servin at the big
table in the big house?

BROOMHILDA
I like it a lot Monsieur Candle.

CALVIN CANDIE
It's a lot better then sizzling in that
hot box, or draggin' your ass through a
bramble bush, ain't it?

BROOMHILDA
Yes 'em.
With Candie interrogating Broomhilda, Django tenses up.
Stephen clocks this.
Stephen decides to test Django's reaction.

STEPHEN
You know Monsieur Candle, the doctor might
be interested in seein' Hildi's "peeled"
back. Seein' as he don't see many niggers
where he from.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
When you was alone with Hildi here, didja
just speak German, or did ya git her
clothes off?









!20
Dr.SCHULTZ
We just spoke.

CALVIN CANDIE
So you haven't seen her back?
Dr.SCHULTZ
No I haven't.

CALVIN CANDIE
Then Stephen's right, you would probably
find this interesting. Hildi, take off
your dress, and show us your back.
Django hears this.
Broomhilda instinctively shoots a look to Django.
Stephen clocks it.

LARA LEE
Calvin, I just got her all dressed up
and looking nice.

CALVIN CANDIE
But Lara Lee, Dr.Schultz is from Dusseldorf,
they don't got niggers there. And he's a
man of medicine. I'm sure it would
fascinate him, the niggers endurance for
pain. I mean Hildi got something like
fifteen lashes on her back. Lara Lee get
one, she'd lose her mind. These niggers
are tough, no doubt about it.

LARA LEE
Calvin, we are eating - dessert, no less.
Ain't no one wanna see her whipped up back.
Django continues to watching this play out.
Stephen watches him.
Candie folds.

CALVIN CANDIE
Okay okay Lara. Maybe after dinner.
During the brandies.
Broomhilda - dismissed - takes Calvin's dishes and heads back into the
kitchen.
Stephen takes one more look at Django, and follows Broomhilda behind
the kitchen door.









121

INT - KITCHEN (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
In the kitchen with the OTHER DOMESTICS, Stephen says to Broomhilda;

STEPHEN
I thought you said you didn't know him?
Broomhilda turns around.

BROOMHILDA
Huh?
Stephen approaches her, the other Domestics get quiet and watch.

STEPHEN
I said, you said, you didn't know him?

BROOMHILDA
I don't.

STEPHEN
Yes you do.

BROOMHILDA
Mister Stephen, I don't.

STEPHEN
Why you lyin to me?
As tears begin to well in her eyes.

BROOMBILDA
I ain't.

STEPHEN
Why you cryin'?

BROOMHILDA
Because you're scarin' me.

STEPHEN
Why am I scarin' you?

BROOMHILDA
Because you're scary.
Things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen, that the dinner
table conversation begins to bleed inside.
We hear Dr.Schultz in the next room say;
Dr.SCHULTZ (OS)
.to speak German,with Hildi this
afternoon was positively soul enriching.
Stephen hears this, he's starting to get the idea.









1ZL
His eyes to to Broomhilda.

STEPHEN
You, stay in the kitchen.
Stephen moves to the kitchen door, swings it open, and watches
Dr.Schultz prepare to proposition Candie for Broomhilda. Stephen knows
these two jokers (Django and Schultz) are up to something, and now he's
just figured it out.

INT - DINNER TABLE (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
Dr.SCHULTZ
You indicated earlier you would be
willing to part with Hildi?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes siree bob I did.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well in that case allow me to propose
another proposition?
In full "Ole Jimmie" performance, Stephen BARGES in the room,
INTERRUPTING Dr.Schultz.

STEPHEN
- Monsieur Candie?

CALVIN CANDIE
Stephen, you just interrupted Dr.Schultz.

STEPHEN
(to Dr.Schultz)
Oh, I do apologize, doctor. My hearin'
ain't worth a damn these days.

(TO CANDIE)
Monsieur Candie, I need a word with you in
the kitchen.

CALVIN CANDIE
What, you mean get outta my chair?

STEPHEN
If you could manage it. It's about dessert.

CALVIN CANDIE
What about dessert?

STEPHEN
I would rather tell you in private.

CALVIN CANDIE
We're having rhubarb pie, what sort of
melodrama could be brewing back there?









123
Stephen bends down and whispers in his ear;

STEPHEN
Meet me in the library.
Well that's a horse of a different color. That means whatever Stephen
has to say, hasn't anything to do with rhubarb pie. "Meet me in the
library" is their secret signal.

CALVIN CANDIE
Fine friend Stephen, I'll be along momentarily.
Stephen exits.
Candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table.

CALVIN CANDIE
Well as you can see, talented no doubt as
they are in the kitchen, from time to
time, adult supervision is required.
If you'll excuse me a moment.
Candie exits.

TNT - LIBRARY (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
A masculine sanctuary for Calvin Candie. Walls of perfectly bound
books. Stuffed animal heads (deer, boar) that he's shot, sit mounted on
the walls. There's comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the globe.
When WE CUT TO this room, we cut to Stephen sitting in one of the red
leather chairs, drinking a brandy out of a brandy sifter.
Calvin enters the room, sees Stephen sitting in the chair, drinking his
brandy, and doesn't bat an eye. It appears, in this room, Calvin's and
Stephen's life long friendship exits on a different plane. Outside of
outside eyes, in this room, all pretense of master and slave is
dropped, and the number one and number two.. men of Candyland can talk
turkey.

CALVIN CANDIE
What's the matter?

STEPHEN
Those motherfuckers ain't here to buy no
mandingos. They want that girl. -

CALVIN CANDIE
What the hell you talkin' about?

STEPHEN
They playin your ass for a fool, that's
what I'm talkin' bout. They ain't here
for no muscle bound Jimmie, they here for
that girl.









CALVIN CANDIE
What girl, Hildi?

STEPHEN
Yeah, Hildi. The niggers know each other.

CALVIN CANDIE
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

STEPHEN
Did he give you any money?

CALVIN CANDIE
Well not yet, but -

STEPHEN
- Then he didn't R ..Y diddly, not yet no
how. But he was just about to buy, who he
came here to buy, when I interrupted him.
Thank you Stephen - you're welcome Calvin.

CALVIN CANDIE
Where you gettin' all this? Why would they
go through all that trouble, to. buy a
nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth
five hundred dollars?

STEPHEN
Well they're doin' it cause Django's in
love with Hildi. She's probably his wife.
Now why that German gives a fuck about
who that uppity son-of-a--bitch is in love
with, I'm sure I don't know.

CALVIN CANDIE
If she's who they want, why the whole
snake oil pitch about mandingos?

STEPHEN
Because you wouldn't pay no never mind
to four hundred dollar. But twelve
thousand got you real friendly.
Calvin thinks ...
.as per usual, Stephen's right.

CALVIN CANDIE
Those lyin' goddamn.time wastin'
sonsabitches!

(LOUDER)
Sonsabitches! You just watch, I'm gonna
fix their wagon but good! Stephen, we
.gonna have us a Candyland tar and
feathering!









FL5

STEPHEN
Now Calvin.. .not that I wouldn't enjoy
seein' something like that ... . but why
don't you sit down and let's talk about this.

CALVIN CANDLE
I let a goddamn nigger and nigger lovin'
huckster insinuate themselves at my
dinner table, and play this whole goddamn
plantation for a fool!

STEPHEN
Calm-the-fuck-down, sit down, and let's
discuss this.
A frustrated Calvin finally collapses in the chair.

STEPHEN
Now look, you knew, and I knew, there
was something up with these two. We just
didn't know what. But now we do. They
don't want you to know how bad they want
that girl. But these ole boys have rode
a lotta miles, went t6 a whole lotta
trouble, and done spread a whole lotta
bull to get this girl. They must want her
mighty bad. Way I see it, ain't nothin'
changed. They wanna buy a nigger, you
wanna sell a nigger.The only thing done
changed is the advantage.

(BEAT)
Now we got it. .So let's go back in there
and busts these motherfucker's chops.

INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
The Dinner Table Guests listen to Lara Lee'Candie-Fitzwilly hold court
melodramatically ... . Till ... . Calvin Candie enters the room from the
kitchen door.
Lara Lee, oblivious to her brothers change in demeanor, blurts out upon

SEEING HIM;

LARA LEE
There you are! I was beginning to think
you and that of crow ran off together.
Schultz and Django feel the change in their host's demeanor, as he
stares down the table at them.

CALVIN CANDLE
That'd be a hellva note, wouldn't it
Lara Lee?

(CON'T)









1Z J

CALVIN CANDIE

(CON'T)
Lara Lee, I just looked out the big winda.
Ace Woody's out there dealin' with some
shady slaver sellin' a passel of Ponys.
Would you be a dear and go out there and
give them gals an eyeball. That of boy
knows everything to know 'bout mandingos,
But he don't know diddly 'bout black puddin'.
Lara Lee excuses herself and leaves the room, as she goes out,
Bartholomew, with his Sawed Off Shotgun, comes.in behind Schultz and
Django.

CALVIN CANDIE
Can I ask you two gentlemen to look over
your shoulder?
Schultz and Django do, and see Bartholomew with his sawed off shotgun
pointing at them.
Calvin Candie removes his arm from behind his back, and in his hand
he's holding a big ugly hammer.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now lay your palms flat on the table top.
They put their palms on the table.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now you lift those palms off that turtle
shell table top, Bartholomew gonna let
loose with both barrels of that sawed off.
There's been a lotta lies said around this
table tonight-but that.. .you can believe.

(BEAT)
Mr.Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect
the pistols hangin' on those boys'hips?
Mr.Moguy does.
Holding the hammer in his hand, Candie continues to hold court.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now where were we? Oh yes, I do believe you
were just getting ready to make me a
proposition to buy Broomhilda. Right?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Right.

CALVIN CANDIE

(YELLING TO

STEPHEN)
Stephen! Bring out Hildi!








Ix?
Stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door, holding
roughly in his grip, Broomhilda. He holds a small Derringer pistol
against the side of her head.
Django and Schultz react.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now it should be quite clear by now I know
you're not here to buy no mandingos.
Reason y'all came to Candyland, is y'all
want Broomhilda. But y'all don't want me
to know how much you want 'er. So instead,
you waste my time with all this Eskimo Joe
horseshit.

(TO STEPHEN)
Stephen, put her in that chair.
Stephen sits the young lady down in Moguy's old chair.
With their palms against the table, unarmed, Django and Schultz
silently watch Candie's next move.
Candie, still holding the hammer, continues.

CALVIN CANDIE
Now the way I see it, ain't nothin' changed..
You still wanna buy a nigger, I still wanna
sell one. So, with that in mind, in Greenville,
Dr.Schultz, you yourself said, "For the Right
Nigger you'd be willing to pay what some would
consider a ridiculous amount." To which, me
myself said, "What is your definition of
ridiculous?" To which you said, "Twelve
thousand dollars."
Now considering you two have ridden a whole
lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble,
and done spread a whole lotta bull, to
purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would
appear that Broomhilda is, "The Right Nigger."
And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with
Broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I take it you prefer the take it or leave
it style of negotiating.
Candie continuing to hold the hammer continues.

CALVIN CANDIE
Under the laws of Chickasaw County,
Broomhilda is my property. And I can do
anything with my property I so desire.
He brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table, making
everybody jump.









IN

CALVIN CANDIE
And if you think my price for this nigger
is too steep, what I'm gonna desire to do
is, take this hammer and beat her ass to
death with it. Right in front of both y'all.
He SMASHES the arm rest of the chair Broomhilda's sitting in.

CALVIN CANDIE
Put up or shut up, Schultz. You wanna save
this nigger bitch, you gonna pay my price.
Dr.SCHULTZ
May I lift my hands from the table top in
order to remove my billfold?

CALVIN CANDIE
Yes you may.
Dr.Schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit
jacket, and says;,
Dr.SCHULTZ
Easy come, easy go.
He slides the billfold down the table to Candie. The plantation owner
takes out the money, does a quick count, then looks down the table at
the seated Schultz, and says;

CALVIN CANDIE
Pleasure doin' business with you.

TIME CUT

INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
INSERT: Calvin signing over Broomhilda's BILL OF SALE.
.Moguy signs as a witness.
Broomhilda stands next to Django, and watches her Master sign her
freedom papers.
Dr.Schultz sits off by himself. He's very disturbed.
All the white people with Calvin Candie are happy and celebrate
Candie's successes with glasses of Brandy. Lara Lee, Ace Woody, and
Brown and Cody have joined the' celebration.
For an experienced horsetrader, the just concluded transaction is a
thing of legend. He just sold a Pony, with a tore up back, and a
runaway "r" burned in her cheek - ain't worth five hundred
dollars- for twelve thousand.








Stephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else.
The Other domestics bring out little plates of rhubarb pie, and buzz
around pouring coffee for the white people.
Candie walks over to the seated Schultz, he carries a small plate of
rhubarb pie with him.

CALVIN CANDIE

(TO SCHULTZ)
Rhubarb pie?
Schultz looks at the pie and the man.
Dr.SCHULTZ
No.

CALVIN CANDIE
Are you brooding 'bout me getting the best
of ya?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Actually, I was thinking of that poor
devil you fed to the dogs today, D'Artagnan.
And I was wondering what Dumas would make of
all this.
Calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs. Broomhilda's
bill of sale, and her freedom papers. As he says the following he
examines he papers.

CALVIN CANDIE
Dumas...?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Alexander Dumas. He wrote "The Three Musketeers."
I figured you must be an admirer. You named
your slave after that novel's lead character.
If Alexander Dumas had been there today, I
wonder what he would of made of it?

CALVIN CANDIE
You doubt he'd approve?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Yes his approval would be a dubious proposition
at best.

CALVIN CANDIE
Soft hearted Frenchy?
Dr.SCHULTZ
Alexander Dumas is black.









1 30
Schultz rises, puts the papers in his back pocket, .looks to his two
companions, Django and Broomhilda, and says;
Dr.SCHULTZ
We got it, let's go.

(TO CANDIE)
Normally Monsieur Candie, I would say,
auf wiedersehen. But since what auf wiedersehen
actually means is, till I see you again,
and since I never wish to see you again,
to you sir, I say, goodbye.
Schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit.
When Calvin says to the German's back;

CALVIN CANDIE
One more moment, Doc!
Dr.SCHULTZ
What?

CALVIN CANDIE
It's a custom here in the South, once a
business deal is concluded, for the two
parties to shake hands. It implies good
faith.
Dr.SCHULTZ
I'm not from the South.
He turns to leave.

CALVIN CANDIE
You're in my house, doctor, I'm afraid
I must insist.
This turns Schultz around.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Insist what...? That I shake your hand
before I leave? Then I'm afraid I must
insist in the opposite direction.
Calvin walks closer to the German doctor.

CALVIN CANDIE
You know what I think you are?
Dr.SCHULTZ
What you think I am? No I don't.









1310,

CALVIN CANDLE
I think you are a bad loser.
Dr.SCHULTZ
And I think you're an abysmal winner.

CALVIN CANDLE
Never the less, here in Chickasaw County
a deal ain't done till the two parties have
shook hands. Even after all this paper
signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand.
Dr.SCHULTZ
If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw
away twelve thousand dollars...?
I don't think so.
Schultz looks to Django and Broomhilda.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Let's go.

CALVIN CANDIE
Bartholomew, if she tries to leave here
before this German shakes my hand.
Cut 'er down.
Schultz looks to Django... . then to Candle..
.and then with a smile on his face, and a twinkle in his eye, asks

CANDLE;
Dr.SCHULTZ.
You really want me to shake your hand?
Django gets it.

CALVIN CANDIE
I insist.

DR
-Schultz smiles.
Dr.SCHULTZ
Well, if you insist.
Django goes to stop him...









1 714
The German crosses toward Candie, offering him his hand...
Candie offers his hand to Schultz...
The small DERRINGER POPS into Schultz's outstretched hand...

POP!
He SHOOTS CALVIN CANDIE in the heart.
Candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart, and he
falls to the floor.
Everybody is stunned.
Schultz looks to Django.
Django looks back.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(TO DJANGO)
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.
Dr.SCHULTZ is BLOWN APART by Bartholomew's SAWED OFF SHOTGUN.
The room comes to its senses and attacks Django and Broomhilda.

FADE TO BLACK








We FADE UP FROM BLACK to see:
The soles of Django's bare feet. A rope is tied around the ankles, and
it's obvious he's been strung up, upside down.
The CAMERA moves down his naked body, down his legs (we see his wrists
are'bound with ropes to his thigh), down his bare buttocks, down his
whip scarred back, to the back of his head which hovers just about
three inches from the barn yard wooden floor.

INT - BARN - AFTERNOON
Eight year old stable boy, Timmy, wipes the unconscious Django's face
with a wet rag. They are all alone in the barn.
Django begins to come to ...

TIMMY

(SHHH'S HIM)
Act like you still sleepin'.

DJANGO
Where's Broomhilda?

TIMMY
Who?

DJANGO
Hildi, the slave girl that ran away a
couple of days ago. They had her in The
Hot Box.

TIMMY
I don't know 'bout no girl.

DJANGO
How 'bout that German white man I came
here with?

TIMMY
Oh he's dead. His body's over there.
Django twists upside down on the rope, and sees the corpse of his
friend King Schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor. The sight of
the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills Django with pain and anger.
Just then head overseer Ace Woody walks in the barn.
Upon seeing Ace, Timmy hightails it out of there, Ace throws an empty
bucket at the fleeing boy.

ACE WOODY
Git on outta here, boy!









133
Django, slightly..swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside down
at Ace Woody, all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie, which
makes him look a bit like Wyatt Earp.

ACE WOODY
So y'all bounty hunters,.huh?
Django thinks, "How does he know?"

ACE WOODY
I knew there was something fishy 'bout, y'all.
We found your wanted posters and book of figures
in your saddle bags. I gotta say, ain't never
heard of no black bounty hunter before. A black
boy paid to kill white men? How did ya like that
line of work?
Django retorts, upside down.

DJANGO
Well, it turns out I was a natural.
Ace woody laughs.

ACE WOODY
Boy, people 'round here are cross wit you.
Ace Woody pulls up a tiny milking stool, and sits down on it, a body
length from the hanging man.

ACE WOODY
See Boss Man was a rather beloved figure
'round here. Now he's dead as fried chicken,
everyone 'round here blames you.
Ace Woody opens his black suit jacket, we see not only does he wear a
gun and holster around his waist, he carries a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE ina
shoulder holster. He removes the big blade from its sheath.

ACE WOODY
Yep, Boss Man's gone. Poor Calvin. Poor
goddamn Calvin. We're burnin' him in a few
hours. At sunset. Should be real pretty.
However ... . I don't think you're gonna be
able to attend.
Ace takes the Bowie Knife and THROWS IT...
. IT LANDS stuck in the wooden barn yard floor, four inches from
Django's face.
Ace Woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool, and slowly walks
the length of the floor between him and Django, pulls the blade out of
the floor, and walks back to his stool, and sits back down.
As he does this, he says;









ACE WOODY
Now I understand you didn't really have
nuttin' to do wit it. It's that German
sunbitch the trouble maker. You just wanted
to git your girl, and hightail your nigger
asses outta here. Now I appreciate that.
But grieving folks 'round here need someone
to blame. And I guess they figure if you
hadn't brought your black ass 'round here
in the first place, Boss Man still be alive.
And you know what, they got a point.
He THROWS the knife again...
.this time IT LANDS in the floor two inches from Django's face.
He walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool.
As he does he says;

ACE WOODY
Now when it comes to making a nigger regret
the error of his ways, believe me when I.
tell you, I know every goddamn trick in the
book. Now there's a lotta ass busters out
there try an' git creative with the way they
bust ass. But me... .I always found the best
methods are, tried and true.
He THROWS the knife again...
Django JERKS his head back ...
.and the knife LANDS in the floor, right where Django's head was.
Ace Woody stands up, walks the floor to the Bowie, yanks it out of the
wood., and straightens up, standing right beside the hanging upside down
naked black man. Ace talks confidentially to the bound man at his
mercy.

ACE WOODY
You know Blackie, here at Candyland, I had
me a real sweet deal. These last eleven years
training Calvin's mandingos I made me more
money I made my whole goddamn life.
And no end in sight, neither.

(BEAT)
Then you came along. Knocked me right off
that perch I was sittin' pretty on. You think
Miss Lara gonna be as.interested in
mandingos as her brother?
Uuummmm...I don't think so. What I think,
is you done fucked up my good thang.
So when it comes to you, Django boy, you
could say I gotta axe to grind.









IJS
He grabs a handfull of Django's genitals in his fist. He takes his big
Bowie, and places the razor sharp BLADE against Django's nut sack.
Django dances at the end of the rope like live bait on a fishing pole.

ACE WOODY
How's the blade of that Bowie feel against
your ball sack, Blackie? A Bowie right off
the wet stone. Now that's what I call sharp.
Django dances some more ...

ACE WOODY
Yep nigger, I'm gonna snip them nuts.

(BREATH)
On the count of three.

DJANGO SCREAMS:

DJANGO

NO!!!!

ACE WOODY

ONE ...

DJANGO

NO DON'T DO IT!!!!!

ACE WOODY
Got to do it, boy. TWO...

DJANGO

NO!!!! !
Just then Stephen appears in the entrance of the barn blacksmith
facility. He's holding Django's clothes in a bundle under his arm.

STEPHEN
Cap't, Miss Lara lookin' for you. She wanna
talk about the Old Man's funeral.
Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snippin'
Django. She gonna give 'em to the LeQuint
Dickey people.
While still keeping a firm grip on Django's'junk, Ace Woody says;

ACE WOODY
Well she didn't waste a minute tellin' me.
Ace Woody looks down at Django, both men get over the aborted emotion
of what almost happened.

ACE WOODY

(TO DJANGO)
How disappointing.









171

ACE WOODY

(TO STEPHEN)
Where she at?

STEPHEN
She in the big house. The kitchen.
Ace turns to leave, Stephen goes over to a big fiery furnace in the
blacksmith barn, and begins poking a LONG POKER which lies buried in
the fire.
Django's clothes are dumped by the furnace.

ACE WOODY
You gonna look after our friend?
As, he plays with the poker in the fire, he says;

STEPHEN
Oh yes sirree Bob, you know I am!
01' Snowball and a certain naked ass
upside down nigger we both know, gonna
have us a big of chat.
He removes the big black poker from the furnaces fire, it's RED HOT END

GLOWS ORANGE.

STEPHEN
Snowballs just makin' sure his talking
stick is all nice and FROSTY.
Ace Woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn.
Just Stephen with a red hot poker, and naked, bound upside down Django,
alone.
With the red hot poker in his hand Snowball approaches the naked
hanging Django.

STEPHEN
I bet you an' that German thought y'all was
on easy street for awhile - didn't ya?
Y'all track Hildi to the Old Man.
You get the idea to go to Greenville -
look up the Ole Man there.

(BREATH)
That was a good idea. I bet y'all couldn't
believe how easy it was. You meet Moguy, he
buys your horseshit. Ya' git your ass invited
to Candyland, no fuss no muss. Ya' ride the
whole way to the plantation, no one the wiser.
Then ya' ride in to Candyland - ride your
goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking
Big House.









137

STEPHEN

(BEAT)
And that's where you met me. And that's when
you knew your goose was cooked.
He TOUCHES Django's NIPPLE with the ORANGE HOT TIP of the poker.
Unlike a lot of movie hero's, Django doesn't take torture silently and
stoically. This shit fucking hurts, so you best believe he screams his
fucking ass off, and twists in agony when he gets touched by the orange
tip of that red hot poker.

STEPHEN
Now that fancy talkin' white man of yours
didn't know what's what. He still thought his
ass hadda chance. But like the One-Eyed Charly
you are, you always know the end is near
'fore the white folks.
With the ORANGE HOT poker, he BURNS OFF Django's other NIPPLE.
The smell of burned flesh smokes in the air. Stephen makes a show of
breathing it in his nostrils.

STEPHEN
Damn Nigger, you smell good.
He walks behind Django with the poker.

STEPHEN
You know, when you was sittin' on that feather
bed in the quest room in the Big House -
After you slapped my ass to the floor
You were sayin' something 'bout my BARE BLACK
ass, and how you were gonna BUST IT.
Remember that, Bright Boy?
He places the HOT ORANGE END OF THE POKER hard against Django's BARE
buttocks.
Django SCREAMS!
Stephen LAUGHS.
Stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire. He goes
through Django's clothes and pulls out his tan pants. He tosses them on
the floor by the hanging man.

STEPHEN
You leavin', that's what you can take
with you.
Stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man, and as he talks to
him, he begins fondling Django's genitals.









I31

STEPHEN
Now you were quite the topic of conversation
for the last few hours. Seemed like folks
never had a bright idea in their life, was
comin' up with different ways to kill your
ASS. Now most of 'dem ideas involved fuckin
wit your fun parts. But while that might SEEM
like a good idea. Truth is, once ya snip a
niggers nuts, most bleed out. Then I say;
"Hells bells, the niggers we send to LeQuint
Dickey, got it worse then that." Then they're,
"Let's whip 'em to death," "Throw 'em to the
mandingos," "Feed 'em to Stonesipher's dogs."
And then I say, "What's so special 'bout that?
We do that shit all the time. Hells bells,
the niggers we send to LeQuint Dickey got it
worse then that."
He stops massaging Django's balls.

STEPHEN
So Miss Lara got the bright idea of givin'
your ass to The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
And as a slave of The LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, hence forth, till the day you die,
you will be swinging a sledgehammer, all day,
every day, turning big rocks into little rocks.
And trust me when I tell you it's gonna be
'bout as much fun as it sounds. We sell 'em
the mandingos ain't good for nuttin' no more.
Like them three y'all came back with. For them
big garboons we get twenty a piece. They last
'bout six months. Skinny nigger like you,
I give two or three.
Stephen turns to leave.

DJANGO
Where's Broomhilda?

STEPHEN
She's all right for now. Miss Lara
soft hearted on 'er. She gave her
to Billy Crash. He was sweet on 'er.
Now Billy Crash might not look or
smell too good, but ain't nobody
gonna bother her.
Stephen limps away.

CUT TO









137

EXT - CANDYLAND - AFTERNOON
The Caravan coming from The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company comes riding
up to the plantation. It comes equipped with one CAGE WAGON (from a
prison), ONE white trash PECKAWOOD named FLOYD to drive the wagon, a
2nd white trash PECKAWOOD named ROY to ride lead horse, and a white
trash PECKAWOOD named JANO to bring up the rear riding horses ass, plus
a pack horse that carries dynamite for the mine.
The three peckawoods, who all talk with thick Australian accents, have
stopped the caravan and are having a powwow.

ROY
It's chaos 'round here. Some bastard shot
the big boss. Let's git the niggers and
git out.
The Three mandingos who weren't sold in Greenville, Rodney, Chicken
Charly, and Chester are walked to the wagon by overseers Tommy Giles.
and Broomhilda's new owner Billy Crash. All three slaves carry the
bundles of personal belongings they've had since Greenville. Chester
wears a hat, and Chicken Charly has a corncob pipe in his mouth.
The wagon driver, Floyd, approaches them.

FLOYD
You blacks line up.
They do.

FLOYD
What's your names?

CHESTER
Chester.

CHICKEN CHARLY
Chicken Charly.

RODNEY
Rodney.

FLOYD
I'm.Floyd, this is Roy, and that's Jano.

(POINTING AT

CHESTER'S BUNDLE)
What's that?

CHESTER
It's my stuff.

FLOYD
Throw it in the dirt.









1 40
All three throw their only belongings in the dirt. Floyd takes the'hat
off of Chester's head and sails it away. As well as ripping the
corncob pipe out of Chicken Charly's mouth and tossing it in the dirt.

FLOYD
(to Chicken Charly)
You won't be doin' much smokin' mate.
(to all three)
You are now the property of The LeQuint
Dickey Mining Company. Git in the cage.
This is going to be worse then the three even thought. They climb into
the cage wagon. Floyd locks it behind them.
Roy, the head Aussie, pays Billy Crash for the slaves, when we hear Ace
Woody call out;

ACE WOODY (OS)
Hold on, we got another hammer swinger
for ya.
Ace Woody comes walking out of the barn with Django, shirtless and
barefoot (just like we met him at beginning of the story), wearing his
old tan pants, and his wrists bound by a rope.

ROY
We can't use that skinny bastard.

ACE WOODY
We got an arraignment with Mr.Dickey to take
punishment niggers from time to time.

ROY
No one tole' me 'bout no arraignment.

ACE WOODY
Well if Mr.Dickey ain't takin' you into his
confidence, I'm sure I don't know why.

ROY
Look, no one tole' me 'bout -

ACE WOODY
- No, you look peckawood, this nigger got Boss
Candie killed. And we want his ass punished.
Now I know you need our bucks. So.unless you
wanna ride back to the mine, and tell Mr.Dickey
how and why you fucked up our nice little
business relationship, take this nigger and
hush up about it!

ROY
Fine, stick 'em in the goddamn cage.









"H
Django sees the three mandingos in the cage. They see him too.
Django stops Ace Woody.

DJANGO
Whoa whoa whoa, you can't put me in there
with them. They'll kill me. What about all
that -turning big rocks into little rocks-
shit y'all was. talkin' about? I mean that was
the idea ain't it? You put me in there with
them big ass garboons they kill me on the way.
I mean if that's the idea, that's the idea,
but I didn't think that was the idea.
Ace knows he's right, so he turns to Roy and Floyd.

ACE WOODY
He can't go in there with them.

FLOYD
Why not?

ACE WOODY
They'll kill him.

FLOYD
I don't give a damn.

ACE WOODY
Well we do! He killed the fuckin Boss Man,
we want the mine to grind him to gravel!

ROY
Jano, you're riclin' horses ass, you take this
black and make sure he keeps up.

JANO
Oh, I'll keep 'em up.
Jano takes the rope tired around Django's wrists.and ties the other end
around his saddle horn.
The LeQuint Dickey Mining Company caravan leaves Candyland.

EXT - MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
The Caravan makes its way down a dirt road in pretty Chickasaw County.
Stoic Roy riding lead horse, Floyd driving the cage wagon, Rodney,
Chester, and Chicken Charly bouncing around inside the cage wagon, Jano
riding horses ass, and Django being led on foot behind him.

DJANGO

(TO JANO)
Hey boy!
Jano ignores him.

DJANGO
I said, hey white boy!

JANO
Keep your mouth shut black, you ain't got
nothing to say I wanna hear.

DJANGO
What's he pay you?

JANO
Who?

DJANGO
LeQuint Dickey?

JANO
You gotta few more things to worry about
black boy, then what I get paid.

DJANGO
I ain't worried about it. I'm just curious.
I mean, I'm the property of The LeQuint Dickey
Mining Company, ain't I?

JANO
Yeah.

DJANGO
And you work for The LeQuint Dickey Mining
Company, dont'cha?

JANO
Yeah?

DJANGO
Well, I know how much I'm gettin' paid,
how much you gettin' paid? I mean like
for instance, how much you gettin' paid
for today?

JANO
Look black, it don't work like that. Dickey
paid for our passage from Australia to here.
We get a little money to send back home, and
pay him back for the boat trip.









I"

DJANGO
How long you been here?

JANO
'bout two years.

DJANGO
And you ain't paid him back yet?

JANO

(DEFENSIVELY)
No, not yet!

DJANGO

(LAUGHS)
You a slave too, peckawood. They just bought
your ass for the price of a boat ride.
At least they didn't charge us for our boat
ride ... . ha ha ha ha...

JANO

(YELLING)
You shut up!
Jano's hand grabs his riding crop, and he brings it up to strike
Django, when the black man says to him;

DJANGO
How'd you like to make eleven thousand
dollars?

JANO
What?
Django steps closer to him.

DJANGO
How would you like to make eleven thousand
dollars -- eleven thousand five hundred,
actually?
Roy, in the lead, yells back to Jano;

ROY
Goddamit Jano, stop fuckin with that black,
and keep up!

DJANGO
Keep riding, just ride slower.
They move forward, with Django walking beside Jano on his horse.









R44

DJANGO
Back at that plantation Candyland, there
was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar
fortune just sittin there, and y'all rode
right past it.

JANO
You be damned, blackie. We're not bandits.

DJANGO
That's what's nice about this fortune, it's
not illegal. You can't steal it, ya gotta
earn it.

JANO
If you got something to say, say it.

DJANGO
The eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune
waiting for you back at Candyland, is in the
form of a wanted dead or alive bounty on
Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang.

JANO
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

DJANGO
Smitty Bacall is the leader of a murdering
gang of stagecoach robbers, The Bacall Gang.
There's a seven thousand dollar dead or alive
bounty on him. And one thousand five hundred
dollars for each of his three accomplices,
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons.
And all four of them gentlemen are sittin back
there at Candyland...laughin their ass off...
cause they just got away with murder.

(BEAT)
But it don't hafta be that way. You and your
mates could get that money.

JANO
Who pays the money?

DJANGO
The Court.

JANO
The Court?

DJANGO
The Austin Texas Courthouse. Oh, and by
the way, the court don't give a damn about
how you kill 'em. You can shoot 'em in the
back, from up on a hill, in the back of
the head, in their sleep - don't matter.

(CON'T)









DJANGO

(CON'T)
Court doesn't care how you do it, just as
long as you do it.

JANO
They.pay us to kill 'em?

DJANGO
No. You kill 'em, and they payyou for the
corpse. Get it?

JANO
I think so... . what did these jokers do again?

DJANGO
Killed innocent people in a stagecoach
robbery. I've got the handbill in my pocket.
Django digs into his tan pants and pulls out the folded up Smitty
Bacall handbill that Dr.Schultz told him to hang on to for good luck.
He hands it to Jano.

JANO
What's this?

DJANGO
I told you, it's the handbill for Smitty
Bacall and The Bacall Gang.
Jano looks at the handbill.

DJANGO
Whatsamatter, can't you read?

JANO
I can read, I just don't have my glasses.
I didn't take 'em with me, because I didn't
think I'd be doin much readin' on a nigger run.

DJANGO
What about that cowboy fella in the lead?

JANO
Roy?

DJANGO
Can Roy read?

JANO
Look, get it straight black, I can fuckin
read. I just don't got my glasses.

146
EXT -- BEAUTIFUL MISSISSIPPI COUNTRY TABLEAUX at DUSK
The LeQuint Dickey Mining Co. Caravan has stopped, and pulled over to
the side of the road.

IN THE CAGE
Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester sit in the cage, and watch through
the bars this new turn of events without any.clear comprehension of
what they're watching.
What the three caged men are watching is the three Australian mining
company employees and Django, off in the distance (where they can't
hear what they're saying), having some sort of a discussion. That
includes the still bound by the wrists Django showing the three men a
piece of paper.

INSERT: SMITTY BACALL'S WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE HANDBILL
Roy holds it in his hand as he reads and Django talks.

DJANGO
I ain't no goddamn slave. Do I sound-like
a fuckin slave? I'm a bounty hunter.
Yesterday as a free man, I rode into
Candyland on a horse with my white German
partner, Dr.King Schultz. We'd tracked The
Bacall Gang from Texas all the way to
Chickasaw County. Found them laying low at
Candyland. We went in to get 'em, things
went sour. My partner was killed, and Calvin
Candie was shot. Everybody there decided to
blame me, so here I am.

(TO ROY)
You know I'm not on the manifest? All of you
know I'm not suppose to be on this trip.
But those four men, are still back there.
They're still wanted. And that eleven thousand
five hundred is still up for grabs. And the
last thing they'd expect is y'all rid.in back
and gittin it.
Django is damn convincing.

ROY
What's your deal? You tell us who they are
and we let ya go?

DJANGO
I ain't tellin' who they are. But, you give
me a pistol, and a horse, and five hundred
dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred,
and I'll point 'em out to you.
He's got these greedy sonsabitches right on the hook...he just needs
one little push.









1Q7

DJANGO
Y'all wanna ask somebody if I'm tellin the
truth, ask them mandingos. You can't put
me in the same cage with them without them
killin me. Why ya think that is? Ask them
.am I a Candyland slave, or did I ride in
there on a horse, with a white man, yesterday?

CUT TO

ROY AND FLOYD
go to the Cage Wagon to talk with the three mandingos. As they walk,
Roy continues to study the handbill.

ROY

(READING ALOUD)
"Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and
The Bacall Gang. For murder and stagecoach
robbery. Seven thousand dollars for Bacall.
One thousand five hundred dollars for each
of his gang members... ." This is a real handbill.

FLOYD
Just because the handbill's real doesn't
mean that other bunch of malarky.is.

ROY
Why would a nigger slave have a wanted dead
or alive handbill in his pocket?
Floyd doesn't have an answer for that one.

ROY
That black's damn convincing.
They get to The Cage O'Men. Roy startles them with a direct question;

ROY
(pointing, behind
him, at Django)
That black ride into Candyland yesterday?
The Caged Men don't know what they're suppose to say.
Roy removes the pistol from his belt, cocks back the hammer and points
the barrel at the cage.

ROY
I'm gonna ask again, and remember I don't
like liars. Is he a Candyland slave, or did
he ride in with a white man yesterday?









CHESTER
Yeah. They walked us from the Greenville
Auction and he rode on a horse with a
white man.

ROY
This white man, was the black his slave?

RODNEY
He weren't no slave.

FLOYD
You sure about that?

RODNEY
Damn sure.
Roy starts taking the possibility of an eleven thousand dollar windfall
seriously.

ROY
What happened at Candyland?

CHICKEN CHARLY
Bunch of shootin, master got shot.

ROY
Who shot 'em?

CHICKEN CHARLY
The German.

ROY
And why did he do that?

CHICKEN CHARLY
The nigger and the German were actin as if they
were slavers, but they weren't.

ROY
What were they?

RODNEY
Bounty hunters.
Floyd is starting to get convinced.

FLOYD
Goddamn Roy, this could be big.
(to the Slaves)
Do you know who Smitty Bacall is?









!Y,

ROY
(barking at Floyd)
They wouldn't go by their outlaw names
you idiot!

CUT TO
Roy and Floyd walk back to Django and Jano.

ROY
Okay black, you gotta deal.
Jano reacts.

DJANGO
I got one more condition.

ROY
What?

DJANGO
When we get there, when the time comes,
you let me help you kill 'em.
Roy whips out a big knife, and cuts the rope around Django's wrists.

ROY

(LAUGHING)
You got a deal, black.
Django interrupts -

DJANGO
You gotta deal, mate.
Roy really laughs this time. As does Django and the other two Aussies.

ROY
You're all right for a black fella!

THE CAGE
Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester watch the sight of the white men
cutting the ropes that bound the black man's wrists, as well as them
all sharing a laugh, with wonderment. "Who is this Nigger?"

BACK WITH THE LAUGHING QUARTET

ROY
We'll give you that pack horse.

DJANGO
What's them saddle bags filled with?

FLOYD
Dynamite.








!so

DJANGO
I.ain't ridin no horse with no goddamn
dynamite on his back!

ROY

(CHUCKLE CHUCKLE)
Yeah, I can see why. Jano take those sticks
off that horse, and stick 'em in the nigger
cage.
Jano does this, lifting two out of four bags filled with dynamite off
the pack horse, and walking to the cage wagon, unlocking ' the cage door,
and placing the bags inside. The Black Men in the cage don't like this
at all.
Jano removes the last of the dynamite filled saddle bags from Django's
horse, throws them over his shoulders, and begins walking back to The
Cage Wagon.
Django moves to his new pack horse, and says;

DJANGO
Where's my pistol?

ROY
Floyd, you got that rifle on the wagon, give
'em your gun and your belt.
Floyd unbuckles his gun belt, gun and all, folds it up, and walks over
to Django handing it to him. Django accepts it.
About the pistol, Floyd tells Django;

FLOYD
Now don't drop it now. I just had the sights
fixed last month, it's perfect.
Django holding the gunbelt in his hand.

DJANGO
That's good to know.
Without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt, DJANGO SHOOTS FLOYD TWICE
in the chest...
Roy turns around...
Django takes the gun out of the holster...
. BAM...ROY is HIT in the UPPER BRAIN AREA and falls to the grass
dead.
Jano goes for the gun on his hip.
Django SHOOTS ONE OF THE SADDLE BAGS over.Jano's shoulder...KAHBOOM!!!!!








Jano is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS...
The KAHBOOM knocks Django on his ass...
The CAGE WAGON
Rodney, Chester, and Chicken Charlie come down from the shock of the
blast. The image outside the bars of their cage is of DUST and SMOKE in
the air, obscuring all visibility...

THEN ...
A sudden GUST OF WIND comes and BLOWS all the smoke and dust away,
REVEALING in bright color focus...
.DJANGO standing among the two dead Aussies, and whatever is left of
Jano.
He's shoeless and shirtless, but Floyd's pistol and gunbelt sit
wrapped around his waist.
He locks eyes with the three men in the cage..
He then moves towards the wagon, and unhooks the mine company beast,
and climbs aboard him bareback.
He leans over and snatches the RIFLE that Floyd kept on the wagon seat
next to him.
Grabbing a fistful of the horses mane, he digs his heels into the
beast's side. The pack animals SPRINGS TO LIFE under the new rider. By
now it should be apparent that Django brings the best out of horses, and
horses bring the best out of Django.
From his high horse Django looks down at The Three Caged Men...

.THEN...
Using the rifle in a QUICK ONE HANDED MOVE he SHOOTS the lock on the
cage door.
He looks at the three men, especially Rodney, then says;

DJANGO
Throw up that dynamite.
Rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to Django on
his Horse.
Django wraps it around the Horse's neck, turns the beast around, and
without saying another word, rides back in the direction of Candyland.
The Three NOW FREE Mandingos, watch him ride away.
"Who was that nigger?"

A GORGEOUS BIG SKY SOUTHERN PURPLE AND ORANGE SUNSET WE PAN DOWN from
the sky and see in small black silhouette the Funeral Procession of
Calvin Candie carrying the Coffin of the former Master up the hill on
'Candyland that leads to the Graveyard.
A WHITE PREACHER walks out in front of the Procession.
Then comes Calvin Candie's Coffin carried by eight pallbearers,
Stephen, Moguy, Bartholomew, Ace Woody, Brown, Cody, and his best
mandingos SAMSON and GOLDIE.
The first mourner in line is Lara Lee dressed in a fancy black dress,
wide brim black hat, black veil, and ever present black Mammy (Cora)
crying at her side.

CORA
The sky's real pretty Miss Lara. Monsieur
Candie think it real nice.

LARA LEE
Ah, bless you sweet innocent Cora.

WE CROSS CUT WITH SHOTS
of Django RIDING THE HORSE on the way back to Candyland. The bare
backed black man riding the horse bareback, holding the RIFLE in one
hand, a fistful of the horses mane in the other, hauling ass against a
gorgeous SUNSET SKY, looks like an Indian.

EXT - TRACKER SHACK BUNKHOUSE - SUNSET
The same GORGEOUS SUNSET SKY over the same shitty Tracker shack
-Bunkhouse that Mr.Stonesipher and his three obscure companions share.
The GERMAN SHEPHERDS (including Marsha) rest in the chicken wire kennel
next to the bunkhouse.

INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET
The FOUR TRACKERS are.missing the funeral, hanging out in the bunkhouse
wearing their beards. Mr.Stonesipher, Lex, and Stew are playing a
mountain card game which looks like poker, except the way you get rid of
your cards is different. Instead of chips they play with, "NIGGER EARS"
(yes, the ears of slaves). On a second viewing the audience may notice
that some of the slaves at Candyland are missing one ear.
Jake, the biggest, is off by himself, pounding nails into a small
delicate BIRDHOUSE he's making.

head...

SHIRTLESS DJANGO
moves quietly through the woods.

MARSHA
rises to all fours, to listen and smell. out in the darkness, her three
PALS continue to lay out.

DJANGO BY A TREE
he can see the bunkhouse entrance, the LONG HANDLE AXE buried in the
chopping block, the kennel, and the one dog looking his way.

MARSHA

BARK!
The Other Three Dogs wake up, and go on alert.
Django disappears.

INT - TRACKER SHACK - SUNSET
They hear the barking inside.
Mr.STONESIPHER
Jake!
Jake building his birdhouse.

JAKE
Yeah?
Mr.STONESIPHER
Check on Marsha.
Jake, the one not playing the game, puts aside his hammer, and rises to
check on them (these guys are very sensitive about their dogs).

EXT - TRACKER SHACK
As the BARKING gets louder, WE SEE A CLOSE UP of The Axe in the
chopping block, and Django's hand REMOVING IT.

JAKE
opens the bunkhouse door-he sees directly a hundred feet in front of
him, Django standing there with the axe. Just as he reacts...

DJANGO ... . THROWS THE AXE...

JAKE ... . IT HITS HIM IN THE FACE.








After letting go of the axe handle, Django RUNS FULL SPEED toward Jake.
Before the other three have really registered what's happening, Django
has crossed the distance, and is YANKING The Axe out of JAKE'S FACE.
And with AXE in hand, Django chases and fights with all three trackers,
till after a point where he's CHOPPED DOWN TWO OF THEM, Lex, and Stew,
and now there's only Mr.Stonesipher left.
But Mr.Stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic BUCK KNIFE, and is
able to fight back against Django. You know Stonesipher's great with a
knife, plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs, attack attack
attack.
Django uses the axe handle in a defensive position.
The expert Mountain Boy begins SCORING BLADE CUTS on shirtless Django.
The two men fight until they end up losing their weapons. Then it's
just a fight of brute strength, and survival. Mr.Stonesipher is
physically bigger then Django. But if Django's going to save Broomhilda,
not to mention get revenge on all these Candyland motherfuckers, he has
to take Stonesipher's ass out.
This Black Man who has been under the yoke of white man's domination
all his life, and this White Man who feeds black people to dogs, fight
each other for their life.
Django gets his arm around Stonesipher's neck in a headlock, but the
mountain boy is big enough to lift Django. So like a rodeo rider
holding onto bull for dear life, Django tightens his lock around his
opponents neck. Django gets his hand on the HAMMER Jake was building
the birdhouse with, and BRINGS IT CRASHING DOWN ON THE TOP OF

STONESIPHER'S HEAD.
That weakens Stonesipher.
He HITS HIM AGAIN IN THE HEAD.
That drops Stonesipher to his knees.
He HITS HIM AGAIN WITH THE HAMMER ON THE HEAD.
That puts the mountain man down on his back.
He HITS HIM ONE MORE TIME WITH THE HAMMER TO keep him down for good.
The Trackers are all dead.
Only the dogs mad barking remains.
EXT - The FUNERAL - NIGHT
The Funeral for Calvin Candie is underway. The Preacher reads some
words over him.









EXT - TRACKER SHACK - NIGHT
Django, half naked, splattered with blood from the axe murders, steps
out of the shack. He takes a wash basin off the window sill, and walks
over to the WATER PUMP.
Marsha and her three friends-continue to BARK like mad.
He PUMPS a couple of times, and water explodes into the bowl. He
begins washing the blood-off'of himself. As he washes, he says outloud;

DJANGO
What ya doin around here, boy?
Timmy steps from his watching place in the bushes.

TIMMY
I was just walkin' by.

DJANGO
Wanna help me out?

TIMMY
Sure.

DJANGO
My woman, Hildi, is with Billy Crash.
You know where his shack is?

TIMMY
Sure do.

DJANGO
You show me?

TIMMY
Will I get in trouble?

DJANGO
Not by the time I get through killin'
everybody.
Timmy has never heard a black man talk like that. He believes him.

TIMMY
I'll show ya.

Django turns towards the barking dogs. He turns back to Timmy and asks;

DJANGO
You know what toadstools look like?

INSERT: TIMMY picking TOADSTOOLS (POISON MUSHROMS).
INSERT: DJANGO stirring a big pot of BEEF STEW with a wooden spoon in
the tracker shack.
Timmy comes'in carrying a bunch of toadstools inside his shirt.
Django takes the toadstools and Mr.Stonesipher's BUCK KNIFE and CHOPS
the mushrooms into tiny pieces.
He tosses the tiny bits of poisoned shrooms into the beefy sauce, and
mixes it up with the spoon.

EXT - MARSHA'S KENNEL - NIGHT
Django throws the pot of poisoned beef stew over the top of the kennel.
It lands on the ground with a PLOP.
The Angry Dogs, are nevertheless', still dogs, and greedily scarf up
the stew.
Django watches them wolf down their ultimate agony with a smile.

DJANGO
You bit your last nigger, bitch? Bite on that.
Django lifts Timmy up on to the bare backed wagon horse.

DJANGO
First things first, boy. Take me to my horse.

EXT - FUNERAL NIGHT
The funeral is in full melodramatic bore.

TNT - STABLE-BLACKSMITH - NIGHT
Timmy brings Django to the stable on the Candyland grounds. Django goes
straight up to the stall housing Tony and says hello. Tony's happy to
see him. Django feeds him an apple he picked along the way for him.
He turns and sees the body of Dr.Schultz lying in a heap.
And Schultz's horse Fritz in the stable.

DJANGO
Saddle up Fritz and Tony.








Timmy just stares.

DJANGO
Now, boy!
Timmy hops to work.
Django bends down over the body of Dr.Schultz, he takes Broomhilda's
bill of sale and freedom papers out of his back pocket. He also
searches for and finds Schultz's hidden DERRINGER, he keeps it in a
holster around his ankle.
As Timmy saddles the horses, he asks;

TIMMY
Do you feel bad for your friend?
Django rises from the body of his friend.

DJANGO
Yeah, "I do.
As Timmy saddles the horses he says;

TIMMY
I know just how ya feel. I lost a white
friend once. He drowned in the lake.
Django doesn't correct the difference between Dr.Schultz and a white
friend, because there's nothing he could say to Timmy to make him
understand.
He goes over to his pile of clothes, which still lie next to the
furnace. He Puts on his boots. His Green Jacket over his bare chest.
And finally his hat.

Look you know Me, Hildi. I'm an ass buster
from way back. But you know I've always been
sweet on you. I don't wanna bust your ass.
So don't make me! Now I'm gonna go shit.
You calm down.
He exits the shack to go the outhouse, leaving Broomhilda alone.
WE MOVE INTO A CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA lying on the bed. She cries for
Django, she cries for herself...

.THEN...
She HEARS an IMPACT SOUND, and a MUFFLED "Ooomph" SOUND.
And through the spaces in the wooden planks that act as walls in Billy
Crash's shack, she sees a figure fall to the ground.
Then she sees another figure through the wooden planks move towards the
front door.

CU BROOMHILDA
Her face, stained with tears, watches the door.
A soft "Knock Knock" on the door.

BROOMHILDA

Yes?

Here's your bill of sale, and freedom papers.
No matter what happens to me, hold on to these
and get out of the south.

BROOMHILDA
What's gonna happen to you?

DJANGO
Ain't nuttin' gonna happen to me honey,
I'm just sayin'. Now go to the stable, little
Timmy's got our horses .saddled. Your horse is
named Fritz. He's a damn fine horse. Meet me
around the side of the big house.

BROOMHILDA
But what about you -

DJANGO
- Don't worry about me. I'll see you, with
Timmy and the horses, by the big house.
He sends her on her way.
Django looks up and sees the silhouettes of the funeral party walking
down hill heading back for the big house.









(60
EXT - The TRAIL BACK TO The BIG HOUSE - NIGHT
The Family unit of The Late Calvin Candie and his sister Lara Lee walk
back to The Big House for a drink. This Candie Family Unit consists of:
LARA LEE (unarmed) in her black flowing funeral dress.
CORA (unarmed) her mammy, walks with Miss Lara, holding her hand.
STEPHEN. (unarmed) dressed in his fancy black velvet version of his
normal House Nigger outfit, walks on the other side of his mistress
Miss Lara, holding her other hand.
ACE WOODY (armed with a gun belt.around his hip) dressed in his Wyatt
Earp like funeral black suit, with the string tie, walks by himself.
LEONIDE MOGUY (armed with a gun belt around his hip) walks by himself.
BARTHOLOMEW (unarmed) dressed in his tight fitting business suit, with
his hat, walks alone.
BROWN and JINGLE BELLS CODY (both armed with guns on their hips) both
dressed slightly like cowboy peacocks, walk together.
and finally,
SAMSON and GOLDIE (unarmed) Calvin Candie's two prized mandingos,
wearing suits they borrowed from Bartholomew..
This CANDIE FAMILY UNIT walk to The Big House for a few post funeral
drinks.
They enter the lawn in front of The Big House, and head for the front
door.
Broomhilda on Fritz and Timmy riding on Tony come along the side of the
property by some shed. They see The Candie Family Unit, all dressed in
their darkest finery, walking towards the front steps of The Big House.
The woman and little boy stop. But the group of enemies aren't looking
their way.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
moves closer towards the front of The Big House...

WHEN ...
The front of The Big House

EXPLODES!
knocking the.Candie Family Unit flat on their collective asses.
BROOMHILDA and TIMMY
can't believe their eyes.









I6 I

WOOD - STONE - PLASTER - DIRT - DUST - GLASS - SMOKE - GUNPOWDER
hang in the air.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
starts coming to their senses. Nobody was killed, or even seriously
hurt (unless you count eardrums), just stunned.
As their minds try and grasp with what just happened, their eyes look
up from the ground, and try and see through the smoke and dust.
The'SMOKE and DUST thins a little, and we see inside the smoke the
mansion has been obliterated, but The Big House front steps remain.
CUE cool MUSIC.
STEPHEN sees something in the smoke, squints.
ACE WOODY sees something in the smoke, squints.
BROWN and CODY see something in the smoke, squint.
In the SMOKE and DUST we begin to see a FIGURE, walking towards them.
ACE WOODY squints at the FIGURE.
MOGUY sees the.FIGURE.
CORA attending to Miss Lara sees the FIGURE, then MISS LARA sees it.
The FIGURE moves further out of the SMOKE and DUST.
ACE WOODY, on the ground, his hand starts to move towards the gun
around his waist.
Then he sees The FIGURE.is carrying something in his left hand...
.it's Floyd's Winchester, he raises it, and points it at Ace.
ACE WOODY's hand moves away from his gun.
The FIGURE steps out of the SMOKE. It's DJANGO dressed in his DJANGO

OUTFIT.
STEPHEN, ACE WOODY, MOGUY, LARA LEE, BARTHOLOMEW, CORA, BROWN and
JINGLE BELLS CODY, SAMPSON or GOLDIE...Nobody can believe Django's
standing there.
He stands at the top of the front steps of The Big House, looking down
at The Candie Family Unit, all lying on the front lawn, Winchester
rifle held casually in his left hand. His right hand held casually by
the gun on his hip.
The CANDIE FAMILY UNIT
all on their ass in the grass, look up at Django with a mixture of
Wonder, Fear, and Hate.









ICZ

WE MOVE INTO A ROMANTIC CLOSE UP OF BROOMHILDA
as she watches this.
As DJANGO looks out at the ten stunned enemies spread out on The Big
House front lawn,. and as they look back from the grass at him.
The black man in the cool green jacket says;

DJANGO
I bet I.know what you're thinkin', Ace Woody?
You'.re thinkin', why didn't I'cut off that
niggers nuts when .1 had the'chance? Right?

ACE WOODY
I guess I shoulda'.

DJANGO
Yes you should of.
He points the Winchester at the people spread out on the grass.

DJANGO
Everybody stand up!
It's now Django who gives the orders. They stand up quickly.
Django, with the rifle pointing at them, just looks at The Candie
Family Unit. Enjoying their collective hatred.

THEN...
He tosses the rifle away.
Then moves his right hand by his gun belt in his holster, as he takes a

SHOWDOWN STANCE.
EVERYBODY realizes DJANGO's intentions.
Even BROOMHILDA and TIMMY.
DJANGO looks down from his position at the top of The Big House steps
at the ten people, and says;

DJANGO
All black folks, take ten steps away from
the white folks.
DJANGO's eyes go to STEPHEN, who looks back at him.

DJANGO
Not you Stephen. You're right where you
belong.









163
The Black Folks, Cora, Bartholomew, Samson, and Goldie begin taking ten
steps away from the White Folks and the gunfight.
LARA LEE can't believe Cora's leaving her.
CORA is "I'm sorry Miss Lara, but I never did nuttin' to that nigger."
DJANGO looks to STEPHEN, and takes Schultz's hidden Derringer out of
his pocket.

DJANGO

(TO STEPHEN)
Let's see if you can handle this as well
as you can my nuts?
He tosses the Ole Man the tiny gun.

DJANGO

(TO EVERYBODY)
Somebody give Miss Lara a gun.
BROWN gives LARA LEE one. of his two guns.

BROWN

(TO DJANGO)
Can I at least cock it for her?

DJANGO
Yep.
BROWN cocks back the hammer of the peacemaker, and puts it in her hand,
and points it towards the ground.

BROWN
(to Lara Lee)
Okay Miss Lara, keep it pointed down till
the shootin' starts. Then bring it up as
fast as you can.
LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLI can't come to grips with what she's.in the
middle of, who she's facing, what's in her hand, or what's about to
happen.

DJANGO
(to the six)
Make your play hillbillies.
The MUSIC SWELLS.









16'F
EVERYBODY, except for LARA LEE is READY:

DJANGO ACE WOODY

STEPHEN MOGUY

BROWN CODY

LARA LEE
The PEOPLE watching on the side:

BARTHOLOMEW SAMSON BROOMHILDA

CORA GOLDIE TIMMY
EVERYONE'S ready, but no one wants to start this party...

TILL...
ACE WOODY starts to go for the gun in his holster, and STEPHEN starts
to raise his Derringer.
But it's no contest.
As soon as Django saw any movement from the six in front of him,
Floyd's Pistol was QUICKSILVER FAST in. his right hand, as his left hand
FANNED the Pistols Hammer, SHOOTING INSTANTLY all five White People (and
Stephen) standing in front of him.
They all fall to grass in different ways..
It was never any contest, they and WE (the audience) just didn't know
HOW GOOD DJANGO was.

FLASH ON
DJANGO showing off his incredible FAST DRAW and ACCURATE MARKSMANSHIP
to Dr.Schultz.
Dr.SCHULTZ

(SMILING)
You know what they're going to call you,
my boy? "The fastest gun in the South."

BACK TO SHOWDOWN
DJANGO stands on the top steps of what's left of'The Big House, looking
down at The Candie Family Unit, who all lay dead or dying on the
Candyland front lawn.
The WITNESSES can't fathom what they'just witnessed.









 65
All the CANDIE FAMILY UNIT lies on the grass SHOT. But some are still
alive. We HEAR MOANING coming from LARA LEE, CODY, and MOGUY.
DJANGO sees this.
The Black Man reaches behind him and comes out with a DYNAMITE STICK.
He tosses it on the grass among the bodies.
He takes aim with his pistol; and FIRES.
It EXPLODES.
Finishing off what was left of the Candie Family Unit, not to mention,
blowing the limbs off of many of them.
The LAWN is SILENT.
DJANGO'S PISTOL goes back in its holster.
Django walks down the front steps of The Big House, feeling tremendous
satisfaction in the wrath he just wroth on Candie and Co.
He removes Dr.Schultz's tiny Derringer from Stephen's dead hand,
putting it in his pocket. Then heads over to where Broomhilda and Timmy
wait for him with Fritz and Tony.
As he,walks up to Broomhilda on Fritz, he says;

DJANGO
Hey Little Trouble Maker.

BROOMHILDA
Hey Big Trouble Maker.

DJANGO
Down, boy.
Timmy hops off of Tony.
Django climbs aboard Tony. He says to Broomhilda;

DJANGO
I tole' you ain't nuttin' gonna happen
to me.

BROOMHILDA
Yes you did.

DJANGO
Girl, you're gonna hafta start trustin' me.

BROOMHILDA
I'll keep that in mind.









   66
Django looks down to Timmy.

DJANGO
Thanks for the help, boy.
He reaches into his saddle bag, and pulls out an apple, and tosses it
down to Timmy.

DJANGO
That's for you. Good luck Tim.
(he points to
the Northern Sky)
The North star, is that one.
He looks to Broomhilda on Fritz.

DJANGO
You gonna hafta keep up, ya know?

BROOMHILDA
You won't wait for me.

DJANGO
Better not.

BROOMHILDA
You won't.

DJANGO

(SMILING)
Better not.

BROOMHILDA

(SMILING)
You won't.
They kiss.
Then, astride Tony, Django leaves Candyland having rescued his
Broomhilda from her Mountain, her Ring of Hellfire, and all her
Dragons.

SHOOTING SCRIPT

July 19, 1978





FADE IN :

1   EXT SPACE (S)                                                1

An ever expanding infinity of light and color as CAMERA


TRAVELS THROUGH deep space, MOVING DIRECTLY for one
pinpoint of light: a STAR GROWING RAPIDLY as we SWEEP
TOWARD IT, a normal white star SUDDENLY CHANGING,
brightening, flaring unbelievable intensity: supernova.
The CAMERA HOLDS just a moment, then MOVES on, SEARCH-
ING through space, the jeweled beauty of other star
systems, sparkling nebulae, swirling hydrogen clouds.
STILL MOVING, then CAMERA FINDS:

2   EXT. AREA OF LUMINESCENCE (S)                                2

In the far distance, slowly growing in size as CAMERA
APPROACHES: it resembles, vaguely at this distance, an
Aurora Borealis: flaring colors from the fringes,
beautiful yet ominous. It is so large, this Cloud, it
can envelope an entire solar system. CAMERA CONTINUES
APPROACHING the Cloud, and then suddenly, crossing
our POV, a:

3   KLINGON HEAVY CRUISER (S)                                    3

In a graceful, turning arc toward the mysterious
LUMINESCENCE. CAMERA FOLLOWS this Klingon, then FINDS
a second Klingon cruiser, also turning toward the Cloud,
which continues to grow in size as the Klingons
approach at warp speed, CAMERA CLOSING on the lead
ship, until the vessel's detail can be clearly MADE
OUT: lights, weaponry, power systems, identification
emblazoned on the nacelles and saucer in Klingon
language (and symbols).

4   INT. KLINGON CRUISER BRIDGE (O)                              4

Clearly alien, an ODD-SOUNDING KLAXON signaling
"battle stations." Orders issued in KLINGON LANGUAGE,
the KLINGON CAPTAIN and EXEC peering at an unusual
bridge viewer at the huge area of LUMINESCENT HAZE
directly ahead. In KLINGON DIALOGUE:

KLINGON CAPTAIN
(Give me tactical.)

5   CLOSE - MAIN VIEWER (O)                                      5

goes suddenly  to a TACTICAL GRID SYSTEM, showing the
LUMINESCENT HAZE to be an ENORMOUS BLIP OF LIGHT ON
THE SCREEN, with two TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT complete-
ing their turn on a direct course toward it.

6   EXT. SPACE - THE KLINGON PATROL AND THE HAZE (S)             6

The Patrol is clearly SEEN now on the right of the
bottom of the FRAME... THREE tiny ships closing on the


steadily growing LUMINESCENT HAZE.

7   INT. THE KLINGON BRIDGE - CAPTAIN AND EXEC (O)               7

All eyes on the viewer that shows the ships sweeping
on the Mysterious cloud.

KLINGON CAPTAIN
(In Klingonese)
Visual.

The TECHNICIAN makes the switch.

8   CLOSE - VIEW SCREEN - LUMINESCENT HAZE (O)                   8

growing ever larger, its flaring colors menacing,
mysterious, strangely beckoning.

9   INT. BRIDGE - KLINGON COMMAND CRUISER                        9

The crew stands by for battle.

KLINGON CAPTAIN
(In Klingonese)
Tactical again. Stand by on
torpedoes.

10   EAT SPACE - LEAD KLINGON VESSEL (TORPEDO HATCH) (S)         10

sliding open, the glowing "Hell Fire" of the Photon
Launch tubes, slowly revealed.

11   VERY WIDE ANGLE - THE THREE SHIPS (S)                       11

They are tiny, insect-like shapes moving still CLOSER
to the Luminescent Cloud, so large now that it begins
to dominate all space behind.

12   INT. KLINGON BRIDGE - TACTICAL GRID - CAPTAIN AND           12
EXEC (O)

The growing nearness and enormous size of the Cloud
also reflected on the Tactical Grid, somehow more
awesome by this schematic view. The Captain gestures
the order to "FIRE."

13   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON KLINGON VESSEL - TORPEDO HATCH (S)    13

The BRILLIANT PHOTON BLOBS of the torpedoes spurt from
the tubes.

14   ANGLE ON KLINGON VESSEL (S)                                 14

A deadly PHOTON TORPEDO pattern racing away from the
Klingon and toward the Luminescent glow in the distance.

15   INT. KLINGON BRIDGE - TACTICAL GRID (O)                     15

Three torpedoes are heading directly toward the Cloud.
Suddenly they glow briefly and disappear long before
they reach their intended target.

16   INT. KLINGON BRIDGE - CAPTAIN AND EXEC                      16

incredulous that their torpedoes have disappeared
without a trace.

17   EXT SPACE - THE CLOUD - THREE KLINGON SHIPS (S)             17

as the second and third ships launch torpedoes toward
the color-flaring surface of the cloud. This time we
have an outside, real VIEW of the torpedoes glowing
brightly and then disappearing with no effect.

18   INT. KLINGON BRIDGE (O)                                     18

The Klingon crew grim, desperate, watching a BRIGHT
STACCATO BLIP OF POWER from within the LUMINESCENCE.

KLINGON CAPTAIN
(quickly; Klingonese)
Full force fields; evasive
maneuvers.

19   EAT SPACE - THE CLOUD - THE KLINGON PATROLS (S)             19

Out of the LUMINESCENCE hurtles a FRIGHTENING WHIPLASH
OF ENERGY. It bears down on the Klingon Patrol, now
in an evasive maneuver. Then the WHIPLASH BOLT hits
the third cruiser in a writhing flare of energy which
totally engulfs the vessel.

The other two ships veer off, warping around again into
attack position. The THIRD SHIP has begun to implode
in on itself, the matter-energy of its existence
drained by the WHIPLASH BOLT that HOLDS IT.

20   ANGLE ON REMAINING KLINGON CRUISERS (S)                     20

desperately defending themselves, FORCE FIELDS FULL UP,
RAPIDLY FIRING PHOTON TORPEDOES. But now a SECOND
WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT has emerged from the cloud and
hits the second vessel, DESTROYING it.

The THIRD WHIPLASH BOLT glances off the surviving
Cruiser as the ship retreats in a wide, evasive turn,
FIRING from stern tubes.

21   INT. KLINGON BRIDGE                                         21

The bridge shattered; Klingon bodies. The mortally-
wounded Captain is transmitting urgently:

KLINGON CAPTAIN
(In Klingonese)
... severely damaged. Returning
fire...

22   EXT. SPACE - STARFLEET MONITOR STATION EPSILON 9 (S)        22

Serenity here. A barren, rocky small plantoid softly
lit by the myriad stars. This is a small Starfleet
outpost, antennae sprouting everywhere. Tiny figures
(WORKERS) servicing one antenna illustrate the size
of the installation.

23   INT. EPSILON 9 - MONITOR ROOM - A VIEWER (O)                23

SHOWING the battle scene, and the VOICE OF THE KLINGON
CAPTAIN in his last stand against the Object; his VOICE
is weary, almost mechanical. On the adjacent viewer,
an English printout of the Klingon's words chatters
along the bottom of the picture:

KLINGON CAPTAIN
(In Klingonese)
Imperial Klingon Cruiser Amar...
severely damaged by unfamiliar
weaponry... intruder unidentified..

24   WIDER ANGLE - EPSILON 9 STARFLEET PERSONNEL AND VIEWER (O)  24

At the viewers are a FEMALE LIEUTENANT and FOUR TECH-
NICIANS. COMMANDER BRANCH, a young, alert, enters hur-
riedly, scans he console.

LIEUTENANT
Our sensor drone is intercepting
this on Quad L-14.

KLINGON CAPTAIN (V.O.)
... believe luminescent cloud
to be enormous power field
surrounding alien vessel...
size and description unknown..
our sensor scans unable to
penetrate. Imperial Klingon
Cruiser Amar... continuing
to attack.

BRANCH
That's within Klingon boundaries.
Who are they fighting?

LIEUTENANT
Unknown, sir.

A violent EXPLOSION inside the Klingon bridge -- Klingon
Captain's body is thrown violently against the bulkhead.

TECHNICIAN
I have an exterior visual!

25   CLOSE ON VIEWER (O)                                         25

showing EXTERIOR of the Klingon vessel: a final,
frightening WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT strikes it -- then
the same awesome IMPLOSION INTO FIREBALL.

26   WIDER ANGLE - PERSONNEL AND VIEWER (O)                      26

The Starfleet station onlookers react to the utter
annihilation of the huge cruiser. And now, past where
the cruiser just disappeared -- the mysterious LUMINES-
CENCE approaching in distance. Technician hits a
switch, magnifying the strange CLOUD.

LIEUTENANT
We've plotted a course on that
cloud, Commander: it will pass
into Federation Space fairly
close to us.

BRANCH
Heading?

27   CLOSE ON THE MAIN MONITOR STATION (O)                       27

as its focal point shifts to the huge elliptically-
shaped LUMINESCENCE racing across the sky. MUSIC
(V'GER THEME) COMMENCES in a low, unresolved CHORD
that remains in the background through the remainder
of this scene, and the beginning of the next one.

LIEUTENANT'S VOICE
Sir, it's on a precise heading
for Earth.

Ominously now the LUMINESCENCE increases in size, and
begins to fill the viewer. HOLD A MOMENT, and then:

28   EXT. SURFACE OF PLANET VULCAN - DAY (M)                     28

with the CAMERA MOVING THROUGH masses of thick, steamy
vaporous clouds, swirling about, rising boilingly up
from some unseen, underground source. The CAMERA
CONTINUES MOVING through clouds.

And then... the Vulcan landscape. Harsh, strange
angular peaks and rock formations -- the barren, legend-
ary mountain home of Vulcan Masters.

29   EXT. VULCAN LEDGE - SPOCK ( M   F.P.)                       29

Spock's lean features instantly recognizable despite
unkempt, longer hair and the fatigue born of a long,
harsh discipline he has undergone. His robes, tattered
and dust covered, are that of a Vulcan Aspirant in
study with the Masters. Under the V'ger THEME MUSIC
we HEAR a VOICE in ritual tones:

FEMALE MASTER'S VOICE
Spock, son of Sarek of Vulcan...
and of Amanda of Earth...
diligently you have labored for
purification of mind...

30   REVERSE ANGLE - SPOCK, VULCAN MASTERS AND RUINS             30

In b.g., gigantic ancient Vulcan statues and ruins. In f.g.,
the stone platform on which Spock stands facing a semi-circle
of three similar platforms. On them in regal robes are three
VULCAN MASTERS. The Master in the center is a female, the
other two Masters are male. The elderly female is holding a
cord and ancient pendant as if ready to place it around


Spock's neck at an appropriate moment. Spock is staring up
as V'ger THEME MUSIC fades.

MALE MASTER
(chidingly)
Spock . . . !

Spock turns, giving a small contrite nod -- the ritual
continues.

FEMALE MASTER
Here are these sands, our fore-
bearers cast out their animal
passions. Here our race was
saved by the first attainment of
Kolinahr.

MALE MASTER
Kolinahr: the final shedding of
all emotion.

FEMALE MASTER
You have labored long, Spock.
Now receive from us this symbol
of total logic.

Spock starts to kneel... the Female Master moves in,
intending to put the ancient pendant around his neck.
But Spock now hesitates -- he's troubled as though
uncertain he deserves this symbol and waves the
pendant away. Then, a faint reprise of the V'ger THEME
MUSIC now causes the Female Master to look skyward.
She turns from this back to Spock as she exchanges a
look with the Male Masters.

FEMALE MASTER
(gestures Spock forward)
Come, give me your thoughts.

She kneels with Spock -- lays her hands on his temples
in Vulcan mind-meld position.

FEMALE MASTER
(continuing)
Our minds, Spock... One and
together....

Their eyes close -- their minds meld -- then her head
jerks slightly, her features change as her mind feels
Spock's reactions to the V'ger consciousness. A long
moment, then she opens her eyes, gets to her feet and
looks down on the still kneeling Spock. Then, she
casts aside the pendant she carries -- it falls into
the dust.

FEMALE MASTER
(continuing; sadly)
This consciousness which calls --
it stirs your human half, Spock?
You have not achieved Kolinahr --
Your human emotions are not fully
extinguished.
(turns to the other Masters)
He will not achieve his goal with
us. His answer lies elsewhere.

The three Masters leave -- Spock watches them go, his
disappointment evident even in his stoic features.

31   MED. ANGLE ON SPOCK (M.   F.P.)                             31

CAMERA CLOSES IN on his face as we again HEAR a frag-
ment of V'ger THEME MUSIC -- Spock again raises his
head and peers up into the heavens. HOLD on his face
a moment, then...

SHOCK CUT TO :

32   EXT. EARTH - AN AIR TRAM - DAY (S)                          32

gleaming silver in the sun as it streaks TOWARD THE
CAMERA POSITION and hurtles PAST.

33   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - HILLTOP AIR TRAM STATION -             33
DAY (M)

From this vantage, we can SEE all of twenty-third
century San Francisco stretched out before us. In
the b.g., the familiar forms of the carefully preserved
Golden Gate Bridge and Transamerica Pyramid Building
serve as our only reminders that this is, indeed, San
Francisco.

The AIR TRAM (an anti-gravitational train flying
several feet above the ground) DECELERATES sharply,
settles to the ground with a whisper.

34   EXT. TRAM STATION - CLOSE ON TRAM DOORS - DAY               34

The doors opening, and various TRAVELERS (civilians
and Starfleet personnel) leaving the tram, striding
onto the platform, continuing on their respective
ways. Among the departing throng:

35   KIRK                                                        35

in Admiral's uniform, grim, determined, moving through
the throng. Now and then Starfleet officers nod re-
spectfully; KIRK responds with detached formality; his
mind is clearly set on something he is resolved to ac-
complish here in headquarters -- whatever the cost.
CAMERA WITH HIM, to:

36   INT. AIR TRAM STATION - DAY                                 36

as Kirk strides into the graceful Starfleet HQ building.
Many PEOPLE are about, civilians and uniformed person-
nel; most of them with some air of urgency. (NOTE:
ALIENS interspersed among them, Vulcans, blue-skinned
Andorians, high-domed Vegans, ect.) Kirk continues on
when suddenly he reacts, annoyed as he sees:

37   SONAK                                                       37

a Vulcan, Lt Commander; short, white-haired, grizzled,
hurrying along. Kirk calls to him:

KIRK
Commander Sonak... !

SONAK turns with Vulcan imperturbability to face Kirk
who steps toward him

KIRK
(continuing)
You've received your appointment
as Enterprise Science Officer?

SONAK
(nods)
Based, I am told, on your
recommendation, Admiral. Thank
you.

KIRK
Why aren't you on board?

SONAK
Captain Decker requested I complete
final Science briefing here before...

KIRK
(interrupting)
Here at Starfleet...? The
Enterprise is in final preparation
to leave dock...

SONAK
Which will require twenty more
hours at minimum, Admiral...

KIRK
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting
with Admiral Nogura which will not
last more than three minutes.
Report to me on the Enterprise in
one hour.

SONAK
To you, sir?

KIRK
I intend to be there following
that meeting. Report to me. One
hour!

And Kirk turns, strides purposefully away. Sonak gazes
after him, one eyebrow raised quizzically.

38   EXT. EARTH ORBIT (S)                                        38

In f.g., Orbital drydock offices, rotating slowly but
perceptibly against blue-black of space. Small figures
in spacesuits working on construction, with work belts.
Beyond and below... Earth. In the far distance we can
barely make out an orbital drydock.

39   CLOSER ANGLE - ORBITAL OFFICE CLUSTER (S)                   39

The cluster is a fully-equipped dockyard engineering
center and computer drafting office.

CAMERA MOVES IN AND CENTERS ON an outer "Travel Pod."

40   INT. INNER OFFICE (O)                                       40

an installation which also includes a double position
transporter, in which we SEE the TRANSPORTER EFFECT
BEGIN. With the TRANSPORTER CREW IS SCOTT. He's with
a Technician, busy with a piece of complex circuitry.
Then he turns, sees that it is Kirk BEAMING in here.
As Kirk materializes, steps off the transporter plat-
form, Scott moves quickly to him.

40A   KIRK AND SCOTT                                             40A

The starship Engineering Officer clearly surprised to
see Kirk here. Kirk has the same look of grim de-
termination we just saw in the headquarters building.

SCOTT
Admiral, I've been hoping to see
you. Maybe you can get through
to those thick heads in Starfleet
that...

KIRK
Why aren't the Enterprise
transporters in operation, Mister
Scott?

SCOTT
We're hoping it's only a temporary
problem, Admiral...

KIRK
See that it is.
(moving toward pod)
Take me over, please.

Scott is now eying Kirk just a little warily as he fol-
lows him into the pod. Kirk's determined expression
suggests that some chips are going to fly and Scott
does not want to become one of them.

SCOTT
(carefully)
Admiral, the Enterprise has just
finished eighteen months redesign-
ing and refitting. She needs
testing, a shakedown...

KIRK
Mr. Scott, there's an alien object
with unbelievable destructive
power less than three days away
from this planet...

Kirk hits a button on the travel pod panel -- the air-
lock doors SLAM closed behind them. Then, stepping im-
mediately to the front observation window:

KIRK
(continuing)
... the only Starship in
interception range is the
Enterprise! Ready, or not, she
launches in twelve hours!

Scott throws Kirk an appalled look but is now occupied
in sealing the Outer Pod door and manipulating drive
controls.

CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK TO REVEAL front of the
Pod and arms of the office complex as Pod disconnects
and starts to move.

as it moves way from the office complex. We can
SEE the jet flames of its tiny thrusters as it cir-
cles around, heads off (toward the distant Orbital
dry dock).

44   INT. TRAVEL POD - KIRK AND SCOTT                            44

Scott nervously eying Kirk, and finally deciding to
make one more effort:

SCOTT
The crew hasn't had near enough
transition time with all the new
equipment. And the engines,
Admiral: they've yet to be even
tested at warp power. Add to
that, an untried Captain...

KIRK
(hint of smile)
Two and a half years as Chief of
Starfleet Operations may have
made me a little stale, Mr. Scott
-- but I wouldn't exactly consider
myself 'untried.'

It takes Scott a moment to comprehend, and Kirk smiles
now, nods:

KIRK
(continuing)
They gave her back to me, Scotty.

Scott peers at him, genuinely surprised -- and pleased.
Then:

SCOTT
"Gave' her back, sir...? I doubt
it was that easy...
(returns smile)
But any man who could manage such
a feat, I wouldna dare disappoint.
She'll launch on time, sir...
(with confidence)
And she'll be ready.

And he clasps Kirk's elbow affectionately, then gestures
Kirk to look out the pod window.

45   EXT. OUTSIDE THE POD WINDOW - KIRK'S POV (O)                45

as he looks out: the blue-black of orbital space.

46   INT. TRAVEL POD                                             46

Scott is well aware of what the Enterprise means to
Kirk. As Scott maneuvers the pod to provide the best
perspective, Kirk peers through the observation window,
craning his head, hungry for his first glimpse of the
starship. Scott is watching him, immensely pleased.

47   PAST THEM TO THE POD WINDOW (O)                             47

as we SEE the drydock and more of its detail, and a
hint of what is inside.

48   EXT. EARTH ORBIT - OTHER ANGLES FROM THE POD (O)            48
-                                                                -


50                                                               50

PAST Kirk and Scott the corner of the drydock becomes
larger -- we begin SEEING more of it. And then the
merest glimpse of what is inside the drydock: The
Enterprise slips INTO VIEW.

51   INT. POD - VERY CLOSE ON KIRK AT WINDOW                     51

as he watches, his face reflecting all of it: the awe,
the wonder, the romance, the obsession. The one comp-
lete love of his life. And with that love regained,
he is becoming more fully alive again.

Kirk looks at Scott; for a moment both hold each other's
eye. Scott knows precisely how Kirk feels. Both turn
to the window again.

52   WHAT THEY SEE - THE ENTERPRISE (S)                          52

Now DOMINATING the SCREEN -- the awesome, symmetrical
bulk of the starship comes fully INTO VIEW. And it
dominates Kirk's -- and our emotions.

53   EXT. THE ENTERPRISE - AND THE POD (TINY IN THIS SHOT)       53
-                                                                -
56   AS IT CIRCLES - THE ANTI-LIKE FIGURES OF WORKERS (S)        56

The great ship dwarfs everything. The drydock becomes
a fragile filigree framing the ship's great curved
bulk. The tiny pod continues to move along it.

Small automated welding devices move along the gird-
ers, working with brief, bright orange-white flares.
In other areas of metal lace structure, supplies and
equipment are being loaded onto the ship. The pod
continues moving (Scott is giving Kirk time to see all),
watched carefully by the TINY FIGURES OF SUPERVISING
TECHNICIANS on the drydock. Now the pod moves toward
mating position. It closes in, secures itself to the
outer airlock.

57   INT. POD - AT THE AIRLOCK                                   57

Scott completing the mating procedure, Kirk turning
from the observation window. Outside, the metallic..
CLICK of the pod locking onto the airlock. Now the
"WHOOSH" of the latch doors securing, the CLANG of
security bolts. It's all been a rare and delicious
moment for Kirk, and his face shows it.

OVER the POD INTERCOM we HEAR, "Pod secured. Pressure
equalized." Scott moves the control to open the hatch.

58   INT. ENTERPRISE CARGO DECK (M)                              58

A confusion of organized work and VOICES. The cargo
deck bustles with activity; supplies and equipment
being stored and installed.

59   INT. CARGO DECK - BALCONY AND CATWALK                       59

Kirk and Scott are met by a nervous, perspiring
ENSIGN.

KIRK AND SCOTT
Permission to come aboard, sir...?

ENSIGN
Granted, sir. Welcome aboard,
Admiral... Commander Scott,
you're needed in Engineering
immediately.

SCOTT
(to Kirk)
Sir, you'll excuse me...?

Kirk gestures him to leave, and Scott hurries away.
Kirk stands a moment, gazing down at the cargo deck.

60   ANGLE DOWN PAST KIRK TO FLOOR (M)                           60

The crew maneuvering antigravity devices which move
heavy containers -- scrambles of activity at storage
holds and maintenance lockers.

61   CLOSE ON KIRK AND ENSIGN                                    61

Kirk is drinking it all in. He's home.

ENSIGN
(nervous)
Sir, if you'll follow me, I'll...

KIRK
I think I can find my way,
Ensign.

And Kirk moves off, leaving the Ensign gazing at him,
relieved.

62   EXT. ELEVATOR AND CATWALK                                   62

Kirk ENTERS ANGLE and the doors snap open.

63   INT. ELEVATOR                                               63

as Kirk enters. The doors close. Kirk waits a beat,
savoring this moment too. Then, firmly to the control
panel:

KIRK
Bridge!

The turbo-elevator HUMS WITH POWER as it begins hur-
tling up. On the wall back of Kirk we SEE an electronic
diagram of the Enterprise tracking the elevator's
speedy trip to the Bridge.

64   INT. BRIDGE                                                 64

A confusion of activity and VOICES. Pieces o equip-
ment in a state of disarray: consoles open, fiber
optic tubes unconnected, viewing screens dismantled.
It's a frantic, desperate scene -- a ship and crew to-
tally unprepared. In the midst of this: ALIEN
ensign is assisting UHURA (Lt. Comdr. stripes)deftly
working her communications station, AD LIBBING
"... Hailing frequency four, check. Hailing frequency
five, will someone please check me?" At the helm,
sweat-soaked SULU (Lt. Comdr stripes) has a service
plate open, is peering inside to make delicate adjust-
ments, AD LIBBING "... Helm, now give me a reading on
four point zero zero six of full." And at the Weapons
Control, CHEKOV (Full Lt.)argues with TECHNICIANS who
insist photon torpedoes read "ready" while Chekov
argues the computer is not relaying that information.

65   ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS                                 65

snapping open -- and there is Kirk. For the moment no
one notices him, and he stands watching, remembering.
And then he moves forward toward the command center.

66   ACROSS UHURA TO KIRK                                        66

as she is the first to see him. She reacts,pleased.

UHURA
Captain... Starfleet just
signaled your transfer-of-
command orders!

67   ANOTHER ANGLE - VARIOUS REACTION                            67

as everyone else is suddenly aware of Kirk.

All work stops, with various AD LIBBED greetings from
the old crew: "Admiral Kirk..." "It's the Captain...!"
etc., etc. But most sit or stand, simple gaping at
Kirk, all quite awed. The old hands, Uhura, Sulu, and
Chekov start converging on Kirk. But he gestures them
back, speaking crisply.

KIRK
I appreciate the welcome; I wish
the circumstances were less
critical.
(to Uhura)
Epsilon Nine is monitoring the
intruder; keep a channel open to
them.
(glances around)
Where is Captain Decker?

SULU
He's in Engineering, sir...
(uncomfortable,
indicates Captain's
chair)
He doesn't know.

Kirk reacts with some exasperation, starts away,
addresses Chekov:

KIRK
Mr Chekov, assemble the crew on
the Rec Deck at 0400 hours. I
want to show them what we're
facing.

And Kirk moves to the elevator, enters, is gone. The
moment the elevator doors snap closed:

SULU
I wouldn't have wanted to have
been standing in his way. He
wanted her back; he got her!

ALIEN ENSIGN
(perturbed)
And Captain Decker? He's been
with the ship every minute of
her refitting...

UHURA
(brittle)
Ensign -- our chances of coming
back from this mission in one
piece may have just doubled...!

68   OMITTED                                                     68

69                                                               69

70   INT. ENGINEERING SECTION                                    70

The entire complex a beehive of pre-departure activity.
ENGINEERING PERSONNEL (at least a third of them female)
coming and going, the platform-elevators (small, one-
man lifts to various levels) busy. A gentle but con-
stant HUM and WHIRR flows from the engine core, to indi-
cate a pre-idling mode. There will be continual AD
LIBBED conversation among the Technicians.

Now the Engine Room door opens and Kirk steps into the
area. He stands a moment observing the activity. a
grizzled ENGINEERING CHIEF pushes a huge condenser on
an anti-grav device past irk with a respectful "watch
it, sir" admonishment. Kirk moves on to:

71   THE INTERMIX CHAMBER                                        71

at the middle of the power shaft. Very NOISY here,
and a continual CACOPHONY of COMPUTERIZED AND HUMAN
VOICES calling off equipment checks. And grouped
around a section of burnt-out circuitry are WILLARD
DECKER, Captain's stripes, handsome, in his early
30's; Scott, and two Technicians. Decker and Scott
are working feverishly uncoupling the device,
probing its innards. Decker has discovered the problem,
removed several transistor-type parts, taps them
with a pencil-sized sonic analyzer.

DECKER
(quietly elated)
I thought so! See... the trans-
porter sensor was not activated...

SCOTT
(impressed)
Aye, you were dead right about
that...
(to Technician)
Clearly, put a back-up sensor into
the unit.

72   ACROSS THEM TO KIRK                                         72

as the Technician prepares to install the device,
Scott glances up to see Kirk.

He looks from Decker to Kirk in acute embarrassment
(so that we should realize Scott hasn't mentioned
Kirk's taking over to Decker). Decker now notices
Kirk, reacts pleased.

DECKER
Admiral Kirk...
(shakes Kirk's hand)
We're getting a top brass send
off...?
(self assured grin)
She'll launch on schedule if we
have to tow her out with our bare
hands. Right, Scotty?

SCOTTY
(lamely)
Aye, sir, that we will...

KIRK
(to Decker)
Will, let's go over here and
talk.

He indicates corner. Decker glances bemusedly at
Kirk, then turns to Scott:

DECKER
Let me now when the back-up is
in place.

73   ACROSS SCOTT TO KIRK AND DECKER                             73

as Scott AD LIBS a glum "Aye, sir," and watches them
walk across the Chamber.

74   A CORNER OF THE INTERMIX CHAMBER                            74

just a little quieter here, with Kirk and Decker arriv-
ing, and Decker saying blithely:

DECKER
All due respect, sir, I hope
this isn't a Starfleet pep talk;
I'm just too busy.

Kirk eyes Decker -- then decides the best way to say
it is plainly, directly.

KIRK
I'm taking over the Center seat.
I'm sorry, Will.

DECKER
You are what...?

KIRK
I'm replacing you as Captain of
the Enterprise.

Decker seems shocked into silence; he can only peer
at Kirk who reaches tentatively as though to clasp a
paternal hand on Decker's shoulder, then withdraws it
and continues quickly.

KIRK
(continuing)
You'll stay aboard as Executive
Officer... a temporary grade
reduction to Commander.

DECKER
(finding his voice)
-- You, personally, are assuming
command?

KIRK
Yes.

DECKER
May I ask Why?

KIRK
(nods)
My experience -- five years out
there dealing with unknowns like
this -- my familiarity with the
Enterprise, this crew...

DECKER
Admiral, this is an almost totally
new enterprise. You don't know
her a tenth as well as I do.

75   ANOTHER ANGLE - TO SHOW SCOTT IN B.G. (ACROSS THE           75
ROOM)

Scott, working on the relay, but continually glancing
at Kirk and Decker with worried concern, as Kirk
replies:

KIRK
That's why you're staying aboard.
I'm sorry, Will.

DECKER
No, Admiral. I don't think you are;
not one damned bit. I remember
when you recommended me for this
command. You told me how envious
you were, and if only you could
find a way to get a starship
command again. Well, sir, it looks
like you found a way.

Kirk is silent a moment, peering levelly at Decker,
who returns the gaze with equal intensity. Then:

KIRK
Report to the bridge, Commander.
Immediately.

Decker EXITS. Kirk waits, collecting his composure
as he watches him go. Then Kirk turns to glare at
Scott. Interrupted by a flare as something shorts
out at the mechanism where Scott and Decker had been
working. Technician (Clearly) reacts, hits an inter-
com button fast:

TECHNICIAN (CLEARY)
Transporter room, come in!
Urgent!
(to Scott)
Redline on the transporters,
Mister Scott!

Scott whirls to a console fast, speaks urgently!

SCOTT
Transporter room, do not engage!
Do not....

TECHNICIAN (CLEARY)
(reacting to the reading;
interruption)
Too late; they're beaming now!

Kirk is exiting on a run, followed by Scott.

76   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - INCLUDING TRANSPORTER CHAMBER       76
(O)

An unusually defective looking TRANSPORTER EFFECT in
progress, alternately flashing and glowing -- even the
Transporter SOUND seems wrong, as if struggling to
overcome some problem. At the console, CHIEF RAND and
ASSISTANT are reacting in surprised, near-horror as
they attempt vainly to save the situation.

RAND
(into intercom)
Starfleet, override us!
OVERRIDE...! Yank them back!

Suddenly, from Rand's console,a VIOLENT GLARE -- a
PROTESTING SOUND from the circuitry. And on the con-
sole a red-warning light now begins flashing.

STARFLEET VOICE
Unable to retrieve their pattern,
Enterprise....!

Rand reacts in real horror now as human forms begin to
FAINTLY MATERIALIZE, then FADE AWAY, then REAPPEAR IN
FAINTLY MISSHAPEN FORM as she frantically works con-
trols. Kirk ENTERS fast, steps to the console to
assist Rand; Scott has also come in and moves to the
console, brushes aside the Asst. Chief, and begins
manipulating the additional controls himself.

SCOTT
We're losing the pattern...!

KIRK
(into intercom)
Starfleet, boost your matter gain;
we need more signal!

RAND
Oh, no! They're forming!

77   CLOSER ON THE TRANSPORTER CHAMBER (O)                       77

with the human forms FLUTTERING INTO FULLER AND FULLER
MATERIALIZATION, FRIGHTENINGLY, HORRIBLY MISSHAPEN. We
RECOGNIZE one form as the Vulcan, Sonak -- the other a
human WOMAN. They MATERIALIZE; we HEAR A MOAN form
from the Vulcan -- the Woman's SCREAM OF PAIN. Then,
all at once, the half-materialized bodies are gone;
the transporter chamber is empty.

KIRK
Oh, my God...!

78   KIRK, SCOTT AND RAND                                        78

gazing, horrified, at the empty chamber.

KIRK
(into intercom)
Starfleet, do you have them?

A mutter of utter, vacant silence -- and Kirk and
Scott look at each other again, their pained faces
presaging the answer they already know:

STARFLEET VOICE
(shaken)
Enterprise... what we got back
didn't live long. Fortunately.

Another moment of stunned silence, and then Kirk hits
the transmission button -- fighting to control his
voice as:

KIRK
Starfleet... Kirk. Please...
express my condolences to their
families. Commander Sonak's
can be reached through the Vulcan
Embassy.
(see Rand's stricken
expression)
There was nothing you could have
done, Rand. It wasn't your fault.

And before Rand can answer, Kirk leaves the room.

79   INT. CORRIDOR - TRAVELING WITH KIRK                         79

as Kirk steps out, and the doors snap closed behind
him. In the corridor the furor of the hurried depar-
ture is, as everywhere, quite evident: CREW MEMBERS
move back and forth. But Kirk does not see them; his
mind is tormented by the transporter accident -- was
there something he should have done, could have done,
to prevent it? Should he launch on schedule with the
starship this unready? Has he done right in yielding
to this terrible needs for starship command again,
forcing Starfleet to give her to him? Would Decker's
knowledge of the new design have prevented the acci-
dent?

Kirk reaches a corridor intersection, looks around,
realizes he's lost track of where he is. A passing
YEOMAN stops in response to his puzzled expression.

KIRK
Turboshaft eight...?

YEOMAN
Back that way, sir.

She's indicating back the direction from which Kirk
came. He nods his thanks, turns and moves back down
the corridor.

80   DECKER                                                      80

hurrying down the corridor. The two face each other
a silent moment, Decker studying Kirk curiously.

KIRK
We'll have to replace Commander
Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan
there, if possible...

DECKER
None available, Captain. There's
no one in fact, who's fully rated
on this design.

KIRK
You are, Mister Decker. I'm
afraid you'll have to double as
Science Officer.

And Kirk moves on, Decker stands gazing reflectively
after him.

85    CLOSE - FULL SHOT OF THE KLINGON SHIP BEING DESTROYED      85
(AS SEEN ON VIEWER) (O)

(in the last part of the scene which showed the Klingon
Captain speaking in Klingonese and an English print-
out interpretation appearing at the screen bottom.
The Klingon ship nearly totaled; one engine nacelle
gone, smoke and flame spewing from the other, etc.
And then that final WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT STRIKING AND
SPECTACULARLY DESTROYING THE SHIP, etc.)

But this time, O.S., we HEAR GASPS of incredulity from
many throats (an audience), and various AD LIBBED com-
ments: "My God...!" "I don't believe it...!" "What
could it be...?" Etc., etc.

And then, immediately following this, on the viewer:

86   THE LUMINESCENT CLOUD (AS SEEN ON A VIEWER) (O)             86

(as in earlier Epsilon 9 viewer -- but with no music,
only more AD LIBBED exclamations from an audience.)
The viewer goes blank.

87   INT. RECREATION DECK (M)                                    87

We SEE that all this was being viewed by the CREW
MEMBERS (Aliens included) assembled on the Rec Deck.

The Recreation Deck is one of the largest areas on
the ship, several deck levels high, a part of one
wall consisting of picture windows, through which can
be seen sections of the drydock structure outside.

On another wall is a large viewer, on which was just
shown the Klingon transmission. Leading off and away
from this deck area are what are obviously other
specific recreation areas -- gymnasiums, food centers,
game rooms, lounges, etc.

88   ANOTHER ANGLE OF THE RED DECK - HIGHER LEVEL                88

as the Crew Members chat in low, grim tones -- Kirk
(now with Captain's stripes) appears. As he comes
into view, the two hundred or so crew below go silent.
Kirk grimly indicates the now blank viewer:

KIRK
That's all we know about it;
except that it's now 2.2 days
from Earth. Enterprise is the
only Federation starship that
stands in its way.

89   ANOTHER ANGLE - CREW REACTIONS                              89

as the CAMERA FINDS various faces: human, alien; most
young, all intelligent, forthright -- anxious. Kirk
has paused a moment, now continues.

KIRK (O.S.)
We assume there is a vessel of
some type at the heart of the
cloud. Our orders are to intercept,
investigate; and take whatever action
is necessary... and possible.
(beat)
...We can only hope that the
life form aboard that vessel
reasons as we do.

90   ANGLE ON UHURA                                              90

standing near an intercom, which just then has emitted
a bosun's WHISTLE intercom signal.

BRIDGE VOICE
(from intercom)
Bridge to Captain. Priority
signal from Epsilon Nine --

Kirk leans over to the intercom, speaks into it:

KIRK
Put it on the viewer here...!

91   ON THE REC DECK VIEWER (O)                                  91

as all eyes turn to the viewer which fades into a view
of Commander Branch, in the Epsilon 9 monitor room.
Branch is tense, reflecting extreme urgency. Near
Branch, working intently at the console are the Female
Lieutenant and a Technician.

BRANCH
(from the viewer;
checking console

Enterprise... the Cloud is
definitely a powerfield of some
kind... Measures... My God!
Over 82 A.U.'s in diameter...
Must be something incredible
inside there generating it.
(looks up from
console)
We're transmitting linguacode
friendship messages on all
frequencies. No response.

TECHNICIAN
I have a null reading at the
center of the 'cloud,' sir.

LIEUTENANT
Definitely something inside..
there but all scans are being
reflected back.
(studies readings)
Receiving an odd pattern now..
(toward Branch)
They seem to be reacting to
our scans, sir.

BRANCH
(inspecting another
console)
Some kind of energy surge...
(looking up)
Enterprise... they could be
mistaking our scans as a
hostile act...
(reacts at readings)
Deflectors, emergency full!

Branch hits an alarm button; we HEAR ALARM KLAXON
SOUNDING. The viewer IMAGE DISTORTS, clears again
while Branch -- facing his viewer, continues urgently:

BRANCH
(continuing)
We are under attack...!

KIRK
(to Uhura)
External view...!

92   ON THE VIEWER - EXT. THE DESTRUCTION OF EPSILON 9 (O)       92

as the image of Branch is immediately replaced by an
external view of the plantoid, and the LUMINESCENT
CLOUD (at about the same distance from which the
Klingon cruisers were attacked).

Then it STRIKES the plantoid WITH FULL, CATACLYSMIC
FORCE. The viewer IMAGE BREAKS UP -- and immediately
the entire Starfleet base becomes a maelstrom of FLAR-
ING ENERGY, shattered structure, flying debris. And
then, all at once, there is nothing -- empty space,
Epsilon 9 is gone. We SEE only the stars; and the
mysterious LUMINESCENT CLOUD moving across the distant
sky.

(NOTE: The above is entirely SILENT, and when it is
finished, not a word is spoken.)

KIRK (O.S.)
Viewer off.

93   ANOTHER ANGLE - KIRK                                        93

as the viewer goes blank, all still facing the screen.
Then Kirk turns to the room as if to comment. Then he
stops -- nothing he can say will add at all to what
they've just seen. Instead:

KIRK
Pre-launch countdown will
commence in forty minutes.

94   ANOTHER ANGLE - CREW                                        94

The scene they have just witnessed still vivid in their
minds as they gaze somberly up toward Kirk who is exit-
ing. The bridge crew follows him out. Not a word is
said as the remainder of the crew waits another moment,
then begins to disperse toward their duty stations too.

95   EXT. THE ENTERPRISE IN DRYDOCK (S)                          95

Spectacular ORBIT VIEW of the giant starship in the
process of release. BEYOND US, in half light, EARTH
LOOMS HUGE. The dock welders are gone; the supply pods
float away from the ship. Little tongues of blue flame
spurt from the ship's maneuvering jets.

96   CLOSER - ON ENTERPRISE (S)                                  96

as the large dock umbilical is released, floats free of
its starship attachment. Dock departure is imminent.

97   INT. BRIDGE                                                 97

Kirk in the center seat, intently studying the Naviga-
tion console in front of him (at the Navigator's
station, which is unoccupied.) Other bridge personnel
are busy with their pre-launch duties.

UHURA
Transporters Room and Chief
Engineer Scott report trans-
porter system fully repaired
and now functioning normally,
sir.

SULU
Dock signals clear, Captain.

KIRK
Rely we are holding position
awaiting final crew replacements.

UHURA
Captain, Transporter Personnel
reports the Navigator...
(consults console)
... Lieutenant Junior Grade Ilia
(Eye-lee-ah) is already aboard,
and en route to the bridge.

98   ANGLE ON DECKER - AT THE SCIENCE STATION                    98

as Decker (now wearing Commander stripes) reacts,
almost startled, and Uhura continues:

UHURA
She's a Deltan.

Uhura's tone and expression convey "Deltan" in a
certain, special manner.

KIRK
(reprovingly)
And there are no finer navigators
in Starfleet, Commander.

The last is interrupted by:

98A   ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS                                98A

as they snap open, and there emerges a breathtakingly
beautiful young woman (uniformed as a Navigator Lieu-
tenant) who strides purposefully onto the bridge. A
stunning figure, but hairless, entirely bald but or
delicate eyebrows and eyelashes. Her bald head is not
at all unattractive, in fact exudes an aura of sensual
nudity. Indeed, her whole being exudes sensuality.
(This is a racial characteristic, not a deliberate
presence.) She approaches Kirk

(NOTE: Throughout this sequence, Sulu eyes ILIA with
unrestrained admiration.)

ILIA
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for
duty, sir.

KIRK
(formally; rising)
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.

99   ACROSS ILIA TO DECKER                                       99

as Ilia starts to speak, suddenly stops: she has just
then noticed Decker, who has stepped from his station
to face her. For an electronic moment their eyes meet,
hold in unquestioned recognition.

DECKER
Hello, Ilia.

ILIA
(surprised)
Decker....!

Kirk has observed this with surprise and some concern
(it presages possible complications). Decker turns to
Kirk, slightly uncomfortable at this.

DECKER
I was stationed on the Lieutenant's
home planet some years ago...

Ilia looks from Kirk back to Decker, puzzled at his
sleeve stripes.

ILIA
(eyes his rank
stripes)
'Commander' Decker?

KIRK
Our Exec and Science Officer...

DECKER
(bitingly)
Captain Kirk has the utmost
confidence in me.

Kirk flashes a hard glance at Decker, then toward
Ilia too.

KIRK
(pointedly)
And in you, too, Lieutenant.

ILIA
My oath of celibacy is on record
Captain. May I assume my duties?

While respectful, her tone of voice has been just as
firm as Kirk's.

KIRK
By all means.

100   ACROSS KIRK TO UHURA                                       100

receiving a message, now relaying it.

UHURA
Captain, Starfleet reports our
last six crew members ready to
beam up...
(puzzled)
... but one of them is refusing
to step into the transporter.

Just as Kirk a moment before was tense, now suddenly
he's relaxed again; he rises.

KIRK
(pleased)
Oh? I'll see that he beams up...!

And he hurries from the bridge, onto the elevator, is
gone. A moment of puzzled silence, then:

DECKER
Mr. Sulu, take Lieutenant Ilia
in hand.

SULU
(startled)
Sir...?
(then understands)
Yes, of course...
(to Ilia)
Your pre-programming is already
set in, Lieutenant.

Sulu has almost tripped getting out of his chair. He
starts offering Ilia his hand, then thinks better of
it, withdraws it abruptly, immediately busies himself
punching out equations on her console... AD LIBS,
"It's all on the computer. You'll have no problem..."
Sulu is nervous, fluttery around this lovely creature --
now hits a wrong switch. Produces a BEEPING SOUND which
he fumbles to shut off. She smiles; speaks quietly,
repeats:

ILIA
I'm sworn to celibacy, Mister
Sulu. That makes me as safe
as any human female.

Sulu catches her eye but before he can reply, Decker has
moved in beside Ilia.

DECKER
I now the Captain meant no person-
al insult.

ILIA
(eyes on console)
I would never take advantage of
a sexually immature species.
(looks at him)
You can assure him that's true,
can't you?

Clearly, the remark carries special, personal
significance.

Kirk entering as Rand and her assistant electronically
list the last of the five arrivals who are leaving the
Transporter Chamber. Kirk calls through intercom to
the last arrival, a young female Yeoman.

KIRK
Yeoman, what was the problem
down there?

YEOMAN
(through intercom)
He insisted we go first, sir.
Said something about first seeing
how it scrambled our molecules.

KIRK
Thank you, Yeoman
(hits transmit control)
Starfleet , this is Captain Kirk.
The officer is to be beamed up
immediately!

103   ANGLE ON THE CHAMBER (O)                                   103

A moment, then again the GENERATING HUMMING, and then
the familiar BEAMING EFFECT. And then you SEE McCOY!
He fully MATERIALIZES. He looks himself over as if in
pleased surprise he is still in one piece. CAMERA PANS
McCoy from the Transporter Chamber to Kirk who is hav-
ing a hard time containing his amusement and delight.

KIRK
Well, for a man who swore he'd
never return to Starfleet...

McCOY
(flat, tight)
What happened, Captain, sir, was
that your revered Admiral Nogura
invoked a little known -- and
seldom used -- reserve activation
clause...
(snaps)
... in simpler language, Captain,
sir, they drafted me!

KIRK
(straight-faced)
They didn't...!

Kirk has offered his hand, but McCoy is already flaring:

McCOY
This was your idea! It was
your idea, wasn't it!

KIRK
Bones, there's a 'thing' out
there --

McCOY
-- Why is any object we don't
understand called a 'thing'?

KIRK
(continues)
-- headed this way. I need you...

McCOY
Were you behind this?

KIRK
(nods)
Bones, I need you badly.

Kirk extends his hand again; McCoy delays some moments
-- then finally responds. And once done, it is the long
hand clasp of two old friends reunited despite their
differences. Now McCoy turns to Rand.

McCOY
Permission to come aboard, sir?

RAND
(elated)
Permission granted, sir!

And McCoy moves toward the door, grumbling:

McCOY
I hear Chapel's an MD now; I
need a top nurse, not a doctor
who'll argue every diagnosis...
And --

Even when he's in the corridor his grumbling trails
after him.

McCOY
(continuing)
... they've probably redesigned
sickbay, too. Engineers love to
change things.

104   FULL ON KIRK                                               104

as he gazes fondly after the grumbling McCoy, and now
turns to the intercom, flips it on:

KIRK

110   EXT. EARTH ORBIT - ENTERPRISE AND DRYDOCK (S)              110

The starship within the drydock, but now the maneuver-
ing -- thrusters spurt pinpoints of BLUE-LAME. The
drydock is ready for the starship's departure -- not
a single pod or shuttlecraft in sight. The starship
looms majestically within the lacework girders.

breath. Then:

KIRK
Thrusters ahead, Mister Sulu.
Take us out.

117A   INT. ENGINEERING SECTION                                  117A

Here in Engineering Section, the ENGINE THROBBING
SLOWLY BUILDS to a THUNDERING SOUND. A glow from
the central unit indicates anti-matter intermix
underway. The Engineering Section shudders as the
great engines draw more and more power.

SCOTT

he's awaited, and to him it is equally as sensuous
and gratifying as making love -- which, perhaps, he
is -- to his mistress: The Enterprise.

KIRK

Impulse power, Mr Sulu.
Ahead Warp point-five.

119   EXT. THE ENTERPRISE (S)                                    119

The Enterprise begins moving perceptibly faster --
behind her, the drydock diminishing rapidly in size.

KIRK

CHEKOV

We SEE viewer IMAGE SWITCH to a departing view of
lovely bluish, cloud-laced image of Earth as it grows
smaller, smaller, dwindling quickly as the starship

All hands tense with the excitement of the journey,
on the viewer Saturn -- and its rings -- are falling
away (BEHIND US). OVER this:

KIRK (V.O.)
(concerned)
... in order to intercept the
Intruder at the earliest possible
time, we must now risk engaging
Warp drive while still within the

End of log.

122   ANGLE ON DECKER - SCIENCE STATION                          122

And Decker and Ilia glance at each other -- and again,
you know there is something more than casual in this.

123   ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS                                123

as they open, and McCoy appears, walks over to Kirk
who swings his chair around to face him. McCoy is
his usual dour self.

KIRK
Well, Bones, do the new medical
facilities meet with your
approval?

McCOY
They do not. It's like working
in a damned computer center.

KIRK
(turning to Decker)
Programming ready?

DECKER
Program set for standard Warp
entry, Captain...

Kirk starts to swing his chair to normal position --
Decker calls:

DECKER
(continuing)
... but I still recommend
further simulation study.

KIRK
Mister Decker; every minute
brings that object nearer Earth!
(using intercom)
Engineering! Stand by for
Warp Drive.

McCoy is watching Kirk, a bit surprised at his abrupt-
ness to Decker.

SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE
(worried)
Captain, we need further Warp
simulation on the flow sensors...

KIRK
Engineer, we need Warp speed now!

McCOY
(very gently)
You're pushing Jim. Your people
know their jobs.

Kirk flashes McCoy a glance of annoyance -- then back
to using intercom:

124   INT. ENGINEERING                                           124

The main intermix chambers GLOWING with power; the LOW
RUMBLE of the main engines coming to life.

The CAMERA FINDS Scott in the chamber:

SCOTT
(into intercom)
Hold one minute, please, Captain --

He steps to his console where an ASST. ENGINEER is
working a computer, studying the readouts, punching
buttons, etc. Scott stands over him, grimly observ-
ing. Finally, the Asst. simply shrugs with frustration.

ASST.
That's it, sir; I can't do any
better.

SCOTT
(grim)
Aye, lad...
(into intercom)
It's borderline on the simulator,
Captain: I canna guarantee that
she'll...

125   INT. BRIDGE                                                125

as Kirk, annoyed, interrupts Scott on the intercom.

KIRK
Warp Drive, Mr Scott.

McCoy still watches curiously as Kirk turns to the
helm:

KIRK
(continuing)
Ahead Warp One, Mr Sulu.

SULU
Accelerating to Warp One, sir.

Sulu moves his controls forward -- everyone waits
tensely -- and then we HEAR THE INCREASING THROB OF
THE ACCELERATING ENGINES.

SULU
(continuing)
Warp point seven... point eight
... nine...

126   EXT. SPACE  THE ENTERPRISE - AFT AND AHEAD (S)             126

We SEE the WARP POWER EFFECT build up between the en-
gine "nacelles" -- then the starship makes the QUANTUM
LEAP into warp drive. The stars ahead shift, streak,
colors pulsating and changing as the shift exceeds the
wave lengths of the light spectrum -- and the stars
congeal into a MASS ahead.

127   INT. BRIDGE - PAST KIRK TO THE VIEWER (O)                  127

as the viewer shows the same WARP DRIVE EFFECT. or
another moment all remain tense, and then all at once
relax, release their breaths. Smiles.

SULU
Warp One, sir.

Kirk smiles, pleased, starts swinging his chair around,
at the same time calling:

KIRK
Mr. Decker --

Kirk never finishes the word. At that instant, on the
viewer, a WORMHOLE DISTORTION: a sudden SPIRALING OF
STARS AND FLUID LIGHT narrowing into a VORTEX into
which the Enterprise hurtles. A space trap, a deadly
pandemonium of ALARM KLAXONS, BELLS, VOICES:

KIRK
(continuing)
Wormhole!... Get us back on
impulse power! Full reverse!

128   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (S)                            128

Enterprise has been caught in a matter-time distortion,
sucked into a cylindrical "hole in space" (the Worm-
hole distortion), stars and planets become strange,
elongated shapes, with the Enterprise drawn deeper
and deeper into the vortex.

129   INT. BRIDGE                                                129

The KLAXONS and BELLS CONTINUE, and the crew responding:

SULU
Negative helm control, Captain!
Going reverse on impulse power...!

UHURA
Subspace frequencies are jammed
by Wormhole effect!

COMPUTER VOICE
(terse, flat)
Collision alert...!
Collision alert...!

(Note: Computer alert continues through entire scene.)

DECKER
(consulting his viewer)
Negative control from inertial
lag will continue 22 point five
seconds before forward velocity
slows to sub-light speed.

ILIA
Unidentified small object has
been pulled into the wormhole
with us, Captain! Directly

KIRK
Forcefields up full! Put object
on viewer...!

130   ANGLE ON THE MAIN VIEWER (O)                               130

showing (a magnification view) of a tiny point of light
directly ahead. Meanwhile, Kirk shouts an AD LIBBED
order to Sulu: "Go to Manual override!" Sulu AD LIBS,
"No manual response...!" (Through all this, McCoy
stands frozen, waiting -- and expecting -- the worse.)
Meanwhile, Ilia has reached over to Sulu's console,
hits a button, AD LIBBING, "Navigational deflectors
coming up...!" And then with alarmed dismay:

ILIA
Navigational deflectors
inoperative...!
(consulting her
console, alarmed)
Directional control also
inoperative, Captain...!

DECKER
Wormhole distortion has over-
loaded main power systems...!

131   CLOSE ON MAIN VIEWER (O)                                   131

The picture is switched through two further levels of
magnification, enlarging the object: an elongated,
distorted, pitted asteroid, tumbling toward the Enter-
prise on a collision course.

KIRK
(toward Ilia)
Time to impact...?

ILIA
Twelve seconds...!

KIRK
Mr. Chekov, stand by on the
phasers...!

DECKER
(racing to Chekov's
station)
Delay that phaser order! Arm
photon torpedoes...!

133   ANOTHER ANGLE - McCOY NOTICING KIRK                        133

who has just glanced, surprised at Decker (for counter-
manding the phaser order) -- and for a split instant,
Kirk seems confused. McCoy reacts with enlightenment
as, meanwhile:

134   ANOTHER ANGLE - THE VIEWER (O)                             134

The object even larger.

CHEKOV
Photon torpedoes armed...!

ILIA
Object is an asteroid, reading

DECKER
Fire torpedoes...!

CHEKOV

Torpedoes away...!

135   EXT. SPACE - PAST THE ENTERPRISE AND THE ASTEROID (S)      135

as the starship's photon torpedo tubes EJECT GLOWING
BALLS OF LIGHT ENERGY, which seems to float toward the
oncoming asteroid, almost too slowly. And in these
brief seconds, the asteroid hurtles at the Enterprise,
the huge pitted rock growing even larger than the ship
itself. It FILLS THE SCREEN, as the photon torpedoes
hit, disintegrating the asteroid into thousands of
fragments. Instantly, these fragments pulverize them-
selves on the ship's forward forcefield and deflector
screens. The smaller pieces burn up on impact, clearly
outlining the ship's forcefield barriers.

136   INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (O)                    136

The asteroid fragments still smashing into the force
field screen; the smaller bits like SPARKLERS as im-
pact heat consumes them. The larger sections bouncing
away, the bridge QUIVERING as they hit.

Then one final gigantic fragment strikes, the bridge
SHUDDERS. And then the viewer shows only the normal
SUB-WARP EFFECT: The stars ahead, relatively station-
ary; a feeling of motion, but smooth, visually normal.

CHEKOV
(relieved)
We're out of it...!

DECKER
We are at warp point eight.

Kirk seeming to collect his thoughts now -- he gives
Decker a look, uses the intercom himself:

KIRK
Warp Drive as soon as possible,
Mr. Scott.

SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE
(protesting)
Captain, it was our anti-matter
imbalance that created the
wormhole in the first place. It
will happen again if we don't
correct it.

KIRK
That object out there is less
than two days from Earth, Mister
Scott. We've got to intercept
while it still is out there!

SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE
(near annoyed)
Aye, we understand that sir!
We're doing our best.

as Kirk flips off the intercom, rises determinedly,
faces Decker:

KIRK
Mr. Decker, I'd like to see you
in my quarters.
(toward helm)
You have the conn, Mr. Sulu.

McCOY
(to Kirk)
Mind if I tag along?

Kirk gives McCoy an annoyed look, then strides to the
elevator. Decker, grim, follows -- McCoy brings up
the rear as they EXIT.

as Sulu is punching figures into his console.

SULU

Ilia's attention is directed toward Decker.

SULU
(continuing; gently
reminding)
Lieutenant Ilia...?

ILIA
(a beat; then
quickly)
Confirmed, Mr. Sulu. Confirmed.

And she punches in some equations, then again peers
up at the doors where she last saw Decker. She is
very concerned.

140   INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS                                       140

The doors opening, Kirk entering, McCoy moves to b.g.
while Decker stands attentively, waiting as Kirk
turns to him.

KIRK
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was
my phaser order countermanded?

DECKER
(cool, polite)
Sir, the Enterprise redesign
increases phaser power by
channeling it through the main
engines. When they went into
anti-matter imbalance, the
phasers were automatically cut
off.

Kirk is surprised by this information, perhaps slight-
ly chagrined. After a beat:

KIRK
Then you acted properly, of course.

DECKER
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar-
rassed you.

KIRK
You saved the ship.

DECKER
(coolly)
I'm aware of that, sir.

KIRK
(flaring)
Stop competing with me, Decker!

DECKER
Permission to speak freely, sir?

KIRK
(tight)
Granted.

DECKER
Sir, you haven't logged a single
star hour in two and a half years.
That, plus your unfamiliarity
with the ship's design -- in my
opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes
our mission.

Kirk reacts with anger. Struggles for and regains
control.

KIRK
I trust you will... nursemaid me
through these difficulties, Mister?

DECKER
Yes, sir, I'll do that.

Kirk peers at Decker, who stands facing him
determinedly.

KIRK
Then I won't keep you from your
duties any longer, Commander.
(whirling at McCoy)
Yes, Doctor?

Kirk's last line has drowned out Decker's "Aye, sir."
McCoy says nothing, waits until Decker is gone and the
door closes behind him. Then:

McCOY
He may not be wrong, Jim.

Decker moving toward an elevator -- the elevator doors
open, and there is Ilia. She steps out, faces him.

ILIA
Was he difficult?

DECKER
No more than I expected
(hesitates)
Not as difficult as this. I'm
sorry...

ILIA
That you left? or that you didn't
say 'goodbye'?

DECKER
If I'd seen you again, would you
have been able to say it?

ILIA
(long hesitation;
then shakes head)
No.

Ilia whirls, moves toward her stateroom door, which
snaps open, then closes behind her. Decker stands
gazing at the door, remembering, regretful.

KIRK
Get out of here, Bones.

McCOY
(shakes head)
As ship's doctor, I am now
discussing the subject of
command fitness.

Kirk's expression hardens.

KIRK
Make your point, Doctor.

McCOY
The point, Captain, is that it's
you who's competing...
(a beat, as Kirk reacts)
You pulled every string in the
book short of blackmail to get
the Enterprise -- maybe even
that. And when this mission is
over, you have no intention of
giving her back.

KIRK
(tight)
I intend to keep her, is that
what you're saying, Doctor?

McCOY
It's an obsession -- that can
blind you so far more immediate
-- and critical responsibilities.
Your reaction to Decker is an
example.

Kirk studies him a beat; has McCoy touched a nerve?
Something Kirk himself might have been unaware of?
Kirk starts speaking, but is interrupted by:

UHURA'S INTERCOM VOICE

KIRK
Viewer on.

At his VOICE COMMAND, the viewer comes on with AN IMAGE
of Uhura at her console.

UHURA FROM VIEWER
Signal from a Federation-registered
long-range shuttle, sir. She
wishes to come alongside, and
lock on.

KIRK
For what purpose?

On the viewer, Chekov's IMAGE replaces Uhura.

CHEKOV
It is a courier, Captain. Grade
One priority. Non-belligerency
confirmed.

KIRK
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it.
Viewer off.

Viewer IMAGE FADES. Kirk turns back to McCoy whose
question of Kirk's fitness still hangs there between
them. Eye to eye - then, finally:

KIRK
(continuing)
Your... opinion has been noted,
Doctor.
(beat)
Is there anything further?

McCOY
I hope not.

Kirk nods, exits. McCoy watches him go, hoping his
point has gotten through.

A moment later the hatch slips open - TO REVEAL
Spock. A proud Spock, impassively Vulcan, almost
contemptuously aloof. His hair is now trimmed in
neat Vulcan style; he wears Vulcan attire simple,
civilian, utilitarian.)

SPOCK
Permission to come aboard, sir?

CHEKOV
Granted, sir! Granted!

Spock is already moving out of the pod entry area, im-
passive, no greeting on his lips; no friendship in his
expression.

The elevator doors open, and there is Spock. It takes
everyone a moment to believe their eyes. Then, the
Bridge crew AD LIB their surprise and pleasure.

KIRK
Spock...! Spock, where...how...?

Kirk, smiling, is moving toward Spock with hand out-
stretched. But Spock has already turned and moved
toward the science console where Decker sits.

SPOCK
Commander, if I may...?

150A  AT SCIENCE CONSOLE                                        150A

It takes Decker a moment to realize that Spock wants
to take over the console. He begins getting to his
feet, throwing Kirk a look. But Kirk's attention is
totally on SPOCK. And Spock is already intent on com-
putations he is beginning to punch into the science
console computer.

SPOCK
I have been monitoring your
Starfleet transmissions, Captain,
your engine design difficulties.

Spock continues to punch information into the science
computer -- a monitor screen IMAGE begins to show com-
plex equations which Spock inspects -- he makes a
further computer punch out and inspects a second  monitor
IMAGE of other equations. Only then does Spock seem to
become aware of Kirk and Decker standing there with
questioning expressions.

SPOCK
(continuing)
I offer my services as Science
Officer.

Kirk starts to grin -- then remembers to wipe it off
his face as he turns to Decker.

KIRK
If our Executive Officer has no
objections...?

DECKER
(interrupting)
Of course not. I'm aware of
Mister Spock's qualifications.

KIRK
(grinning openly now;
turns, calls)
Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's
Starfleet commission reactivated;
list him as Science Officer; both
effective immediately.

151   ANGLE TO INCLUDE ELEVATOR DOORS                             151

as they SNAP open -- McCoy and Chapel appear. Chapel
sees Spock at the science console -- she moves in
quickly, overjoyed. Even McCoy seems pleased.

CHAPEL
Mr. Spock...!!!

McCOY
So help me, I'm actually
pleased to see you.

But as Chapel crosses to Spock, her pleased smile
brightening her whole face, Spock turns, dismisses her
presence with a cold disinterested glance -- Chapel
stops, stands dumbfounded. Spock gives McCoy a similar
glance - turns back to his console readings as:

UHURA
That's how we all feel, Mister...

The same cold glance causes Uhura to stop in mid-
sentence. Several grins directed toward Spock are now
fading from bridge crew faces. Spock has turned back
again for a last quick reading at the console and now
stands -- totally ignoring everyone else as he speaks
coolly, unemotionally to Kirk:

SPOCK
With your permission, I will now
discuss these fuel equations with
the Engineer.

Kirk manages a nod, a bit dumbfounded himself at Spock's
strange manner. Spock heads for the elevator -- puz-
zled expressions from the entire bridge crew. Then
Kirk calls after him, very sincerely:

KIRK
Mister Spock, welcome aboard!

Spock continues onto the elevator without any acknow-
ledgment, leaves. Kirk glances, perplexed, at McCoy.
McCoy, equally perplexed, shrugs.

McCOY
Never look a gift Vulcan in the
ears, Jim.

Where, first, CAMERA SHOOTS THROUGH THE WINDOW, the
myriad of stars, space, the whole magnificent vista.
In the lounge, empty but for them, are Kirk and McCoy
-- obviously awaiting Spock, who ENTERS and presents
himself cold and aloof as before:

SPOCK
Reporting as ordered, Captain.

KIRK
Sit down, please.

Spock remains standing, addresses Kirk:

SPOCK
Sir, I would appreciate Dr. McCoy
absenting himself from this
interview.

KIRK
I want him here.
(indicating)
Sit down!

For an instant, it looks like Spock will refuse. Then,
he complies but sits formally, rigidly. He ignores
McCoy totally.

KIRK
You've reported that you felt
strong thought emotions. A
group of minds from a space
vessel? Could you make out any
plan, anything to do with
Earth?

SPOCK
(still formally)
Negative, Captain. I could sense
only what seemed an almost
omniscient pattern of perfect
logic. I can explain nothing
more; I understand nothing more.

Kirk is clearly disappointed -- and a bit uncomfortable
about what he must ask next. He exchanges a glance
with McCoy, then:

KIRK
Also -- there was nothing in your
report about why you're here.

SPOCK
That inquiry invades my personal
life, Captain.

McCOY
Spock, we've already guessed why
you're here...

KIRK
I inquired about you -- learned
you were studying with the
Masters...

Although Spock has been almost infuriatingly emotionless,
his expression shifts slightly. McCoy indicates this:

McCOY
That flicker of emotion confirms
our guess. You failed.

SPOCK
(facing McCoy for
the first time)
Your deductions do you credit,
Doctor... if your puerile
curiosity does not.

McCOY
(not in amusement)
And now, anger, Spock?

Spock looks straight ahead -- his face instantly com-
posed to almost total blankness.

SPOCK
(beat; nods)
I still contain fragments of my
human half.

KIRK
And whatever you sensed out here....

SPOCK
... is my only hope of accomplishing
what the Masters could not.

McCOY
If you achieve perfect logic, Spock,
you'll pay a price. It's given
your planet ten thousand years of
peace, but no poetry's been written
since then, no music.

Spock has come to his feet fast - but Kirk is on his
feet too, confronting him. During which:

KIRK
Let it drop, Bones.
(to Spock)
You are my Science Officer -- I'll
expect an immediate report on
anything further you learn or sense
from here on.

SPOCK
I have accepted service here as
a Starfleet officer... sir.

KIRK
(nods)
I know this has been painful, Spock.
For me too. Thank you.

Spock EXITS. Kirk and McCoy exchange a troubled look,
then EXIT too as CAMERA CENTERS AGAIN ON OBSERVATION
WINDOW, the view of space there.

KIRK

It may be misinterpreted as
hostility!

SPOCK
Intruder scans emanate from

Energy of a type entirely un-
known to me.

UHURA

No response to friendship

CHEKOV

KIRK

ocative action.

Decker has reacted sharply, disapprovingly, to this:

DECKER
Recommend defensive posture,
Captain: Screens and shields.

KIRK
No...

... that could also be misinter-
preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.

take every possible precaution -- ?

KIRK

Captain, I suspect there's an
object at the heart of that cloud.

KIRK

Mr. Decker, I will not provoke
an attack, If that order isn't

The Cloud has now grown so large it DOMINATES THE
ENTIRE VIEWER. Sulu hits a button, reducing magnif-
cation. Immediately, the CLOUD diminishes in size --
but almost instantly begins GROWING AGAIN. Decker's
annoyance (with Kirk) suddenly seems to dissipate as
his total attention is diverted to the cloud.

Decker turning to Spock

DECKER
That measures twelve power?
Ten thousands of starships couldn't
generate that much...

Decker trails his words, realizing that Spock isn't
hearing a word. Spock's attention is on the O.S. main
viewer, totally absorbed by something he's feeling.
He is slowly rising from his seat, stepping forward --
Kirk becomes conscious of this, turns and sees Spock's
strange expression. Before he can speak:

SPOCK
They have... they have been
communicating with us. I sense
... puzzlement. Why have we
not replied?

KIRK
Communicated with us how?

Spock shakes his head... then reacts as if sensing or
theorizing something further. He turns, moves quickly
to his console, begins there as if searching for something.

STRIKES. The bridge lights go out.

In the sudden darkness, the main viewer is all at once
a frantic, furious, pattern of GREEN-WHITE FLARING ENERGY,
accompanied by an EXPLOSIVE SHRILLING SOUND. It seems to

whirling abruptly in his chair, addressing Kirk:

SPOCK
Captain, the Intruder has been
attempting to communicate! Now
placing their transmission on
the speaker...

Immediately, from the SPEAKER we HEAR a SHRILL, IN-
CREDIBLY FAST BEEP.

SPOCK
(continuing)
... frequency more than one

only a millisecond.

175A   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             175A

Chapel and Corpsman are assisting Chekov from the
bridge (we'll have SEEN that the remarkable plasti-
skin sprayed on his hand has completley covered the
ugly burn marks - he is even able to move his fingers
a bit). Ilia returns to her station -- a relief CREW
WOMAN takes over from Decker at Chekov's console.

176   CLOSER ON SPOCK'S STATION                                  176

so we can SEE in more detail Spock's monitor -- various
oscillating waves, and HEAR more of the SHRILL BEEPS as
Spock manipulates his equipment, and continues:

SPOCK
I suspect our messages were too
slow for them to be noticed.
(touches a control)
Programming computer to send
linguacode at their rate.

Decker has hurried in to assist the science console.
Spock indicates a console area -- Decker works there --
Spock works another section of console buttons.

177   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE AND THE CLOUD (S)              177

The Cloud ever closer to the ship now, which is a mere
dot in space compared to the immensity of the energy-
seething, continuous color-exploding Cloud. And then,
suddenly, from the Cloud -- ANOTHER WHIPLASH ENERGY
BOLT. Bearing down upon the Enterprise.

KIRK
(desperately)
Mr. Spock?

ILIA

Spock -- Decker assisting -- works frantically. Spock
is clearly dissatisfied, shakes his head tightly.

KIRK
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!

In the blink of an eye, the entire EFFECT IS GONE.

185   REACTIONS                                                  185

relief, incredulity.

SPOCK
It appears that our message has
been understood, Captain.

KIRK
(to Uhura)
Any reply from them?

UHURA
Negative, no reply, sir.

KIRK
(returning to Spock)
Spock, have you sensed anything
else?

Spock turns, gives the O.S. viewer a glance. Then he
shakes head.

SPOCK
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was
fleeting... minor...
(ponders, then)
... as if carrying a sense of
our insignificance, Captain.

KIRK
Our... 'insignificance'?

All have reacted to this; Kirk exchanges a look with
Spock who nods firmly. Then Kirk sees that both Decker
and Sulu are throwing him a questioning look. In b.g.
McCoy and Chapel have EXITED bridge with Chekov.

SPOCK
We are obviously confronted by
a highly advanced mentality...
yet they cannot understand who
we are, or what we want.

KIRK
But they understood our messages;
they broke off the attack.

DECKER
They may have attacked only as
a warning to us, Captain. To
keep away.

SPOCK
That would presuppose a feeling,
Commander... compassion. I sensed
no emotion, only...
(reverentially)
... pure logic.

Kirk peers at Spock hoping for some assistance on
the decision; but Spock merely peers back at him ex-
pressionlessly: the decision is Kirk's. Kirk faces
Spock one last beat, then turns and starts back to-
ward his chair, calling to Ilia.

KIRK
Tactical plot on viewer.

tactical plot of Enterprise's conic flight path ap-
proach. It shows a large schematic of the Cloud itself
as well as a series of FAINTLY BLINKING schematics of
various recent positions and directional attitudes of
the Enterprise during its approach. These blinking
Enterprise schematics show that the starship has  gone
from a head-on approach to the Cloud into a (tech.
advice) skidding movement around the Cloud (the star-
ship always heading directly toward Cloud center),
with the last Enterprise positions now showing it ap-
roaching the Cloud from a quartering rear approach.

KIRK
Opinion, Mister. Spock?

SPOCK
Recommend we proceede, Captain.

KIRK
Mr. Decker... ?

DECKER
I advise caution, Captain; we
can't withstand another attack.

KIRK
That thing is twenty hours from
Earth. We know nothing about it yet.

Decker glances around, moves close to Kirk so only
Spock is able to overhear:

DECKER
That's precisely the point,
Captain. We don't know
it will do. Moving into the
cloud -- at this time, is
an unwarranted gamble.

KIRK
How do you define unwarranted,
mister?!

DECKER
You asked my opinion, sir.

Kirk looks at him, then at Spock, who once more is
peering in momentary concentration at the viewer,
feels Kirk's gaze -- and turns to him, again expres-
sionlessly; it's up to Kirk.

ILIA
Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary.

KIRK
Viewer, standard ahead.

187   Kirk sits contemplating his next move. Once again, the     187
decision is his. He looks to the Viewer a moment, then:

KIRK
(to Helm)
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.

SULU
Aye, sir.

188   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE                                    188

as the Enterprise slowly enters deeper toward the chamber
ahead. We SEE the sheer size of the Cloud as opposed to
that of the small ship now entering unknown territory.

As the Enterprise enters the Cloud:

189   INT. BRIDGE - REACTIONS AT WHAT THEY ARE SEEING            189

On Viwscreen we SEE a vast array of IMAGES, spiralling
IMAGES, changing in size, shape, colour. Its walls
spinning and turning, looping and twisting, as the
Enterprise proceeds further Into the Cloud.

Amazed bridge crew members can do nothing but awe at
the sight before thier eye's. Even Spock has turned to
view the sight now illuminating the View screen. Kirk
sits pondering, amazed, thinking "What comes next?"

189A   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND V'GER                         189A

Moving slowly through the maze of VISUAL'S seen from

as the CLOUD OBSCURES all now. Everyone gazes at the
viewer, almost mesmerized by the shifting violet power-
field displays.

KIRK
(staring at viewer,
frustrated, awed)
No vessel could generate a
powerfield of this magnitude...

SPOCK
Instruments fluctuating, Captain.

Crew peering at O.S. main viewer with expressions of
near disbelief. Similar reactions as Kirk and Decker
turn too, reacting to:

193   WHAT THEY SEE ON MAIN VIEWER (O)                           193

(V'GER THEME MUSIC UP) The Cloud "Aurora" EFFECT
rapidly thinning -- in the "eye of the hurricane"
center of the Cloud is the object which has stunned
the entire bridge crew.

Rapidly growing in size -- already frighteningly huge.
Totally alien in look. Its enormous bulk is irrides-
cent, faintly glowing, suggesting that it is made up
of exotic combinations of matter, and energy far beyond
the scientific knowledge or ability of Earth's 23rd
Century technology. Menacing and yet strangely
beautiful, both at the same time.

194   VARIOUS ANGLES ON THE BRIDGE CREW AND THE VIEWER           194

The Object continues to GROW RAPIDLY IN SIZE as the
Enterprise continues moving toward it. Everyone is
awed; even Spock, from whom we discern an involuntary,
impressed reaction. Decker is with Spock at the
science console.

DECKER
Incredible dimensions, Sir!
... I make it as seventy-eight
kilometers in length...

All digest the dimensions, as:

198   ANGLE ON THE BRIDGE ELEVATOR DOORS                         198

opening to admit McCoy and Chekov, whose face and hands
are taut with plastiskin applications. Seeing the
object on the viewer (O.S. at this ANGLE), Chekov's
eyes open with wide astonishment. He crosses quickly
to his weapons--defense station, his eyes on the
viewer. McCoy, eyes also fixed on the sight, moves
to Kirk's side.

UHURA
It could hold a crew of tens
of thousands...!

McCOY
Or just one thousand, ten
miles tall.

KIRK
Evaluation, Mister Spock?

199   ACROSS KIRK TO SPOCK                                       199

(This will be the first time we've seen Spock dislay-
ing a definite reaction, almost an emotion.) So
engrossed is Spock in the main viewer IMAGE that he
appears not to have heard Kirk, whose AD LIBS a sharp
"Mr. Spock...!" Spock looks absently at Kirk an
instant, then:

SPOCK
(awed; compelled)
That vessel is generating a
forcefield measurably greater
than the radiation of the Earth's
sun.

KIRK
(turns to Uhura)
Transmit image of the Alien to
Starfleet; advise we are attempting
further communication.

UHURA
(interrupting)
Unable to make contact with
Starfleet. Our transmissions
out of the Cloud are being
reflected back.

ILIA
Distance to object now seventy-
thousand kilometers...

SULU
(turning; concerned)
We're closing in on it rapidly,
Captain.

Concern reflected on the faces of others too. Kirk
considers his next move.

CAMERA TRAVELING WITH ENTERPRISE as it moves on a
parallel--closing course -- Alien continues to GROW
IN SIZE. Although it already seems an impossibly
large vessel compared to the Enterprise, in reality
they are still tens of thousands of kilometers apart;
the incredible size of the Alien is nowhere near being
realized yet.

204A   INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING VIEWER                            204A

Tension high as -- the Alien now appears so close that
its IMAGE MORE THAN FILLS VIEWER. Considerable
tension of bridge -- crew members, throwing nervous
looks from viewer to Kirk. How much closer?!

KIRK
Reduce magnification. Factor
4, Mr. Sulu.

SULU
(uneasy)
We're already two settings
below that, sir.

KIRK
(reacts, then)
Adjust parallel course, Navigator.
Bring us in to one hundred
kilometers distance.

Very nervous looks now directed toward Kirk. Even
Spock gives him a glance, a raised eyebrow.

205   EXT. SPACE - CAMERA TRAVELING WITH ENTERPRISE              205

The Alien Object appears A DOZEN TIMES LARGER THAN
ENTERRISE and still GROWING IN SIZE.

We begin to SEE Alien exterior detailing which had
not even been suspected at a longer distance.

The Enterprise is now quartering in toward the
Intruder, coming closer and closer. The Alien
vessel is still GROWING IN SIZE -- more and more,
its exterior appears to be made of substances never
before seen by a human eye -- substances considered
possible only in the wildest flights of scientific
theory -- plasma-matter, energy fields diamond--hard
in their power, solid sheets of subatomic particles,
crystalline-lace patterns which seem capable of
shifting their nature and rearranging themselves.

205A   ANGLE ON INTRUDER                                         205A

This time, the Enterprise travels on away from us, as
its course takes it angling nearer and nearer the
gigantic Alien Intruder -- the Starship dwindling in
size, growing smaller, smaller, smaller... until it
is a tiny dot compared to the enormity of the Alien
vessel.

206   INT. BRIDGE - VIEWER (O)                                   206

We are coming alongside the mid-section of the Alien
vessel, now so huge that only a small section of it
now completely fills main viewer frame.

SULU
One hundred kilometers...

KIRK
Hold relative position here...

Kirk's voice is blotted out by a DEAFENING, SHRILL-
ING SOUND, accompanied by a multi-hued point of LIGHT
which EXPLODES into BLINDING INTENSITY, obscuring
everything for an instant. Overlapping this action,
we HEAR:

COMPUTER'S VOICE

Continues.

The BLINDING LIGHT FADES and in its lace we SEE a
strange "entity" shocking us with its frightening
appearance and its ugly-sounding THROBBING HUM of
power. It is about seven feet tall and resembles a
"blob" of raw energy in shifting patterns and colors
of deep, ugly hues of upper spectrum violet. Yet,
it looks strangely alive. At the end of the "tendril"
(of light) is an "eye" (a small multi-colored device)

209   CREW REACTIONS -- ELEVATORS IN B.G. (O)                    209

The bridge crew reacting hard, shocked and shaken --
the THROBBING SOUND of the Alien thing intensifies
as it begins to move across the bridge. Suddenly, in
b.g., an elevator door snaps oen and two SECURITY
MEN burst onto the bridge, phasers drawn. Chekov
shouts warningly at the Men:

CHEKOV
No weapons...!

But Chekov is too late: First Security Man FIRES --
the BLAST harmlessly absorbed by the Probe which emits
a SCREECHING nerve-grating SOUND --- sends out a SMALL
WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT which instantly envelopes First
Security Man in a PURPLE GLOW (of implosion). Second
Security Man has almost lifted his phaser -- but now
carefully, slowly is moving his hand away from his
weapon.

210   CLOSER - THE SECURITY MEN (O)                              210

PURPLE GLOW FADES, the First Security Man has simply
vanished.

210A   FULL SHOT - BRIDGE                                        210A

Chekov, like the others, horrified, flips a switch
and the COMPUTER-VOICE ("Intruder Alert") goes OFF.
At the same time Chekov speaks into his intercom:

CHEKOV
Security... do not send further
teams!

The Probe is sending out snake-like tendrils to the
various consoles on the bridge.

These tendrils lash out in a cobra-strike movement,
the tendril-head seeming to enter into the console
affected -- at which time all monitors and instrument
lights there come ON as if the Probe is "reading"
each console function. The crew carefully stays clear
of the tendrils.

Spock has risen, moving to Kirk's side as he slowly
brings his tricorder up, very carefully extracting
its tiny sensor and aiming it at the probe.

CHEKOV
(shaken)
No intruder readings on other
decks, Captain...
(to Spock)
Can that be one of their crew?

SPOCK
(quiet)
A probe from their vessel...
(to Kirk)
A plasma-energy combination...

Meanwhile, the probe is now hovering near Chekov who
sits frozen, fists clenched, jaw tight.

DECKER
Don't interfere with it...!

CHEKOV
Absolutely, I will not interfere!

210B   ANGLE INCLUDING SPOCK'S CONSOLE (O)                       210B

as the "probe" withdraws an energy-tendril from one
bridge station and "inserts" it into another console.

KIRK
No one interfere...! It doesn't
seem interested in us -- only
the ship...!

Kirk's words are never completed as suddenly all the
energy tendrils withdraw from all consoles and a
larger, more powerful-looking tendril lashes out,
snaking into the science console complex.

210C   CLOSER ON SCIENCE CONSOLE                                 210C

Where, also immediately, all the console and computer
lights are suddenly flashing wildly, rapidly --

-- There is an incredibly fast EXCHANGE OF HIGH-PITCHED
BEES -- the computer obviously in unauthorized commu-
nication with the probe!

KIRK
Computer off!

DECKER
It's taken control of the
computer...!

KIRK
It's running our records!
Starfleet strength, Earth
defenses...

As Decker moves to the main power control, Spock now
steps in, his Vulcan strength easily brushing Kirk and
Decker aside. Spock clasps his fists above his head,
brings it down in a SHATTERING BLOW on the console. It
splits open! As the bridge lights dim even more, and
as the science console shorts itself out -- and off,
Decker confronts Spock:

DECKER
We could have cut it off at the
main computer...

SPOCK
This served the purpose.

Kirk has been giving Spock a puzzled look -- Spock now
turns abruptly, and:

210D   ANOTHER ANGLE (O)                                         210D

as Spock, in stepping back, accidentally brushes the
probe's energy tendril -- a FLASH OF LIGHT at the
contact point sends Spock sinning under the rail and
to the floor near Ilia. The probe's energy-tendril
has withdrawn from the darkened science console, hov-
ers high over the dazed Spock as if angrily seeking
the reason for the break in its computer contact.
Spock starts to rise.

ILIA
Mr. Spock, don't move...!

Decker steps toward her, AD LIBBING a grim "Ilia...!"
But he has no chance as:

220   CLOSER ON ILIA (O)                                         220

The Probe hovers over her, its whole mass seemingly
about to envelope her with a single tendril extended
toward her, somehow freezing her into immobility -
and then the entire Probe DISSOLVES IN A BLINDING
FLASH OF WHITE, obscuring Ilia. Almost instantly
the WHITE FLASH FADES -- but Ilia has vanished -- her
tricorder clattering to the deck.

DECKER

KIRK
Forcefields, full remaining

Appropriate ALARM KLAXONS, and COMPUTER VOICES begin
SOUNDING, and all this is lost in a SUDDEN SHRILLING

the energy patterns are prominent on the viewer --
and then the PATTERNS VANISHED and the SHRILL SOUND
FADES -- and:

intricate details of the incredible Alien design.

236   INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING VIEWER (O)                         236

as Difalco arrives on the run, and Decker AD LIBS to
her, "Assume Navigator's station, Chief...!" Difalco,
bewildered, wants to ask what happened, but no time,
and she quickly sits at the post, begins orienting
herself. Meanwhile, Decker has begun an Executive
Officer's bridge circuit, assisting with various con-
soles. Kirk is glancing toward Spock who continues
concentrating on the Viewer, striving to comprehend
the myriad of thoughts he is sensing from he Aliens.
McCoy also arrives on the bridge, takes in the chaotic
scene, watches the Viewer grimly.

239   EXT. ENTERPRISE AND V'GER (S)                              239

At the forward end of the giant, an odd-shapped "iris"
begins opening menacingly. And it is frighteningly
obvious that the tractor beam is pulling the Enterprise
to the opening.

240   INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING VIEWER (O)                         240

showing the unusual "iris" now almost fully open as
Enterprise is drawn closer, closer -- through the
"iris" we now SEE (some of) V'ger's interior: a dark
void relieved only by strange flickering glows of dis-
tant ENERGY FIELD PATTERNS.

The crew reacts with understandable awe, apprehension,
curiosity, as:

DECKER
Captain, suggest a maximum phaser
strike directly at the beam might
weaken it just enough for us to
break free --

Spock replies for Kirk: quickly, as though to make his
point convincingly:

SPOCK
Break free to where, Commander...?
(to Kirk)
Any show of resistance would not
only be futile, Catain...

240XA   ACROSS SPOCK TO KIRK (DECKER AND McCOY IN B.G.)          240XA

as Kirk reacts somewhat curiously to Spock's remark,
but it is Decker who articulates it:

DECKER
(troubled; suspicious)
We don't know that, Mr. Spock.
Why are you opposed to trying?

Before Spock can reply:

UHURA
They're pulling us inside...!

All face the Viewer again, react, with McCoy who has
been observing all these reactions now galvanized
into action:

McCOY
(to Chekov)
Medical observers to all decks!

And he hurries toward the elevators, CAMERA WITH HIM
a moment, then SWINGING BACK TO:

240A   PAST KIRK TO VIEWER (O)                                   240A

Kirk staring at the viewer -- the "iris" now fully open
so that the exterior of V'ger is no longer visible --
and all we can SEE is the monstrous void dead ahead,
which is looming faster and larger before our eyes.
And now we are inside.

244   EXT. ENTERPRISE AND V'GER - AT THE "IRIS" (S)              244

Enterprise now being pulled past the opening -- into
the ship proper. Now we can SEE that the dark void
is actually a vast chamber, dimly and intermittently
lit by POWERFIELDS appearing and vanishing along the
vessel's inner walls, which are miles away in the
distance. And here and there in the chamber gigantic
ENERGY DISPLAYS erupt briefly with a certain symmetry
that suggests they must be part of V'ger's ower or
control systems.

245   INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING VIEWER (O)                         245

Kirk peering awed at the Viewer, the incredible sight
of the chamber -- suddenly glances up to see that
Spock is standing beside him -- Decker nearby, turns
to Spock:

DECKER
(to Spock)
Why bring us inside? Not to
destroy us; they could have
done that outside.

KIRK
They could have many ways of
destroying things, Mr. Decker.

SPOCK
(peering at Viewer)
Something about us puzzles them...
perhaps even concerns them.

ANOTHER, the reality of the situation etched into
each face. Then:

Kirk rises, goes to Spock's station.

249   INT. V'GER ENTRANCE CHAMBER - ENTERPRISE (S)               249

The Enterprise moving slowly forward in this vastness,
its running lights merely specks of light, candles in
the darkness. In the distance those occasional ERUPT-
ING POWER DISPLAYS in distant locations, sizes, shapes
and patterns.

250   INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (O)                    250

showing another persective of the above, and further
away GLOWING ENERGY FIELDS dimly illuminating the alien
ship's walls -- miles away. Strange semi--solid LIGHT
SHAPES (some are "sensor-bee" swarms) traverse the dark-
ness in random directions. But in the distance ahead,
there seems to be an opening to another chamber.

SULU
(of Viewer)
Something ahead, sir; looks
like another area...
(reacts)
It's closing up...!

Sulu is indicating what appears to be a lace-bulwark of
POWERFIELD PATTERNS closing off the "chamber" in the
distance ahead. Kirk, from the Science Station calls
out:

KIRK
Hold station...!

SULU

Thrusters at station keeping...

251   ANGLE EMPHASIZING SPOCK                                    251

at his Science consoles, working rapidly, shifting from
one set of controls to another. Now he hits a master
control -- his console monitors FLASH, then go dark.

SPOCK
Captain...

Spock brings a monitor IMAGE ON again, indicates a
(Povill) pattern showing a line hitting something,
then reversing direction.

SPOCK
(continuing)
All scans are being reflected
back, Captain. Our sensors are
useless.

251A   ACROSS THEM TO THE MAIN VIEWER                            251A

Kirk reacts with disappointment, indicates the main
viewer.

KIRK
Have you been able to analyze
any of this...?

SPOCK
(voice increasingly
reverential)
I believe the light flares to be
energy fields -- undoubtedly part
of the vessel's inner mechanism.
A technology so incredibly
sophisticated that I cannot --

Reacting to a console reading:

CHEKOV

Quarters...!

KIRK
(to Chekov)
Have a security team meet me at
Deck Four main elevator!

A moment's reaction from all at this, Kirk hurrying
toward elevator, calling:

KIRK
(continuing)
Take the conn, Mr. Decker:
Hold present position...
(gesturing Spock
to join him)
Spock...

And Spock rises, joins Kirk and they hurriedly exit,
the CAMERA SWINGING BACK to Decker, his perplexed con-
cern (because of Ilia).

254A   INT. ILIA'S CABIN - THE SONIC SHOWER                      254A

Where we SEE, behind the translucent stall door, what
is unmistakably the form of the NUDE FEMALE.

255   INT. ILIA'S CABIN - KIRK                                   255

entering, Spock slightly behind him - and one Security
Guard. Kirk glances around the room, now glances at
the shower area and reacts as he sees the NAKED FORM.
The others react similarly, even Spock cannot help re-
pressing an expression of surprise. A moment's uncer-
tainty as Kirk peers at them, then he steps to the
stall door, hesitates another instant -- then slides
the door open.

(NOTE: Arrange lighting for bizarre, mysterious effect.)

Kirk's eyes cannot believe what he is seeing:

255A   "ILIA"                                                    255A

standing in the sonic mist, naked but for a small
multi-colored button embedded in her throat. As she
looks at Kirk -- and the others -- the men peer back
at her, speechless.

"ILIA"
I have been programmed by V'ger
to observe and record normal
functioning of the carbon-based
units infesting USS ENTERPRISE.

Kirk peers at her another nonplussed moment, then leans
into the shower to touch a control, his eyes fixed on
the lovely body behind the mist. He punches in a three
digit code. Immediately a HUMMING SOUND emanates from
the shower stall, Kirk closing the door, but 'Ilia"
remaining inside.

256   ACROSS KIRK AND THE OTHERS TO THE SHOWER STALL             256

The HUMMING SOUND just now reaching a gentle crescendo
-- through the translucent door you can see COLORS
ENVELOPING "ILIA'S" FORM. And now the SOUND STOPS.
"Ilia", attired in a leisure robe, steps from the stall,
into the room. She stands facing Kirk, her face impas-
sive, eyes unblinking. He looks her back a moment,
then glances at Spock, who is gazing at "Ilia" in abso-
lute fascination. Kirk addresses her:

KIRK
Who is...'V'ger'...?

"ILIA"
V'ger is that which programmed me.

KIRK
Is V'ger the Captain of the alien
vessel?

256A   ANGLE ON THE DOOR - McCOY                                 256A

rushing in, concerned:

McCOY
Jim, what's --

At the sight of 'Ilia", McCoy's words die in his throat
-- and his trained eyes have instantly told him some-
thing is awry. He unslings his tricorder, aims the
sensor unit at "Ilia". As he reads his instruments, his
face reveals the results (incredulity, fascination).
Meanwhile, from the start:

"ILIA"
V'ger is that which seeks the
Creator.
McCOY
(of "Ilia")
Jim, this is a mechanism...!

Kirk stares at McCoy, then at "Ilia" and realizes that
"Ilia" is indeed non-human. And quickly:

KIRK
Where is Lt. Ilia?

"ILIA"
That unit no longer functions.
I have been given its form to
more readily communicate with
the carbon-based units infesting
Enterprise.

SECURITY GUARD
"Carbon-based units"...?

McCOY
(drily)
Humans, Ensign Lang: us.
(continues tricorder
exam, increasingly
impressed)

KIRK
(to "Ilia")
Why does V'ger travel to
the third planet of the
solar system directly
ahead?

"ILIA"
V'ger travels to the third
planet to find the Creator.

Stunned, disbelieving reactions as all four attempt to
digest this -- Spock gazing at "Ilia" with even more
rapt fascination. Kirk, bewildered, addresses the
others:

KIRK
Find the Creator? What Creator?
Whose...!?
(to "Ilia")
What does V'ger want of the
'Creator'... ?

"ILIA"
To join with him.

256B   FAVORING SPOCK                                            256B

suddenly alert, addressing "Ilia":


SPOCK
Join with the Creator... ? How?

"ILIA"
V'ger and the Creator will become
One.

SPOCK
Who is the Creator?

McCOY
(worried)
Mr. Spock, be careful.

"ILIA"
The Creator is that which created
V'ger.

KIRK
Who is V'ger?

"ILIA"
V'ger is that which seeks the
Creator.

Another moment of total exasperation, frustration, during
which "Ilia" seems to be waiting politely, patiently for
any further questions. When none are forthcoming:

"ILIA"
(continuing; pleasant,
bland)
I am ready to commence my
observations.

SPOCK
(fast; to McCoy)
Doctor, a thorough examination
of this probe might provide some
insight into those who manufactured
it, and how to deal with them.

McCOY
Let's get her to sickbay.

And he grasps "Ilia's" arm to escort her. But is as
though he has seized cast iron: immovable. McCoy is
thrown off balance merely by 'Ilia's" remaining sta-
tionary. She ignores McCoy, addresses Kirk:

"ILIA"
I am programmed to observe and
record normal functioning
procedures of the carbon-based
units.

256B   Kirk glances at McCoy, who is totally bemused, but then   256B
Kirk quickly responds to "Ilia":

KIRK
The examination is a normal
function.

"ILIA"
(a beat)
You may proceede.

McCOY
(carefully)
Thank you.

257   CLOSE SHOT OF EXAMINING ROOM VIEWER (O)                    257

Kirk, Spock and Chekov -- standing over "ILIA" who lies
prone on the table, the physicians moving the scanner
over her.

McCOY
(from the start;
indicating)
... micro-miniature hydraulics,
sensors, molecule-sized multi-
processor chips... and look at
this...

In the b.g., Decker enters, grimly observes the proceed-
ings.

CHAPEL
(impressed)
An osmotic micro-pump... here
and here. Even the smallest
body functions are exactly
duplicated.
(traces with finger
on screen)
And every exocrine system is
here, too --

Chapel breaks off abruptly, noticing "Ilia" is peering
intently -- almost with a glimmer of recognition -- at
Decker. Slightly disconcerted, Chapel continues:

CHAPEL
(continuing)
-- even eye moisture.

"ILIA"
(peering at Decker)
Deck -- er.

257A   FAVORING SPOCK                                            257A

as everyone reacts to "Ilia's" utterance of Decker's
name. It seems to make the deepest impression on
Spock, confirming something he has suspected.

SPOCK
(to "Ilia")
Interesting. Not 'Decker-unit'?

"Ilia" continues peering at Decker with just a hint
of a puzzled frown, a glimmer of distant recognition.
It's the first time we've seen her expression look
anything but cool and bland. This results in the
quizzical rising of one of Spock's eyebrows.

258   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              258

McCoy's examination now turns "Ilia" away from the
others. Spock quickly catches Kirk's and Decker's
attention, indicates an adjoining door -- they fol-
low him out of the room.

259   INT. McCOY'S OFFICE                                        259

as Kirk, Spock and Decker enter, the door snapping
shut -- and Spock touching the electronic lock to
secure them. He faces the others:

SPOCK
Captain... this probe may be a key
a key to the Aliens.

DECKER
It's a programmed mechanism,
Mr. Spock...

SPOCK
We have just seen that its body
duplicates our navigator in
precise detail. Suppose that
beneath its programming, the
real Ilia's memory patterns are
duplicated with equal precision.

KIRK
They had a pattern to follow...

SPOCK
(nods)
... they may have followed it
too precisely.

KIRK
(comprehending)
Ilia's memory, her feelings of
loyalty, friendship, obedience...
might all be there.

259A   ANGLE ON DECKER                                           259A

also comprehending, and not liking it one bit as Spock
and Kirk are both turning their attention to him.

SPOCK
Exactly.
(to Decker)
And you did have a 'relationship'
with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.

DECKER
That probe in there -- in a
different form now -- is the
same thing that killed Ilia!

KIRK
Commander, we're locked in an
alien vessel, six hours from
Earth orbit, our only contact
with our captors is the probe.
If we can control it, persuade
it, use it in some way...

Interrupted by the SOUND of someone trying to open the
locked door behind them. Then a METAL RIPPING SOUND
as they whirl to see:

260   MEDICAL OFFICE DOOR                                        260

with the METAL BUCKLING, TEARING -- and a single
hand slicing the steel door like paper. It is the
"Ilia" probe, her face absolutely impassive, her
whole manner incongruously benign. (Behind her, a
startled McCoy, Chapel and Chekov.) "Ilia" speaks
flatly, blandly.

"ILIA"
I have recorded enough here.
(motions to Kirk)
You will now assist me further.

Kirk exchanges a quick glance with Spock. Then:

KIRK
(indicating Decker)
The Decker-unit can assist you
with much greater efficiency...

"Ilia" has seemed about to object -- but now her eyes
hold on Decker. Then she nods.

KIRK
(continuing)
Carry on with your assignment,
Mr. Decker.

260A   ANOTHER ANGLE - ACROSS DECKER TO THE SMASHED DOOR         260A
(AND "ILIA")

as Decker looks at "Ilia" who stands at the torn door.
You can read Decker's mind: I'm supposed to persuade
that?! He turns back, finds Kirk's eyes on him.
Decker nods.

DECKER
Aye, sir.

"Ilia" and a reluctant Decker EXIT.

260B   EMPHASIZING SPOCK                                         260B

looking very troubled as they watch Decker and "Ilia"
leave. Kirk notices.

KIRK
Spock? Concerned about his
chances?

SPOCK
I am uneasy with that being
our only hope of more information.

Spock EXITS.

261    INT. V'GER - THE ENTERPRISE                                261

floating in the vast, eerie, alien chamber -- sporadic
FLASHES OF ENERGY, erupting now and then. Various
other EFFECTS. OVER this, Kirk's VOICE:

KIRK (V.O.)
Captain's Log. Stardate 7414.1.
Our best estimates place us some
four hours from Earth. No
significant Ilia memory patterns
within the alien probe. This
remains our only means of contact

CAMERA MOVES PAST him to FIND:

263   SPOCK                                                      263

His face fixed with grim determination, walking quietly
with obvious intent not to attract the Tech's attention.
Now he steals up behind the TECH -- and in an instant
has applied a Vulcan nerve pinch. The Tech slumps over
his console.

264   INT KIRK'S CABIN - VIEWER MONITOR                          264

Kirk watching this -- and with him is McCoy. They
continue watching a troubled beat, as:

DECKER
(of pictures)
All these vessels were called
"Enterprise".

"Ilia" is giving the pictures a very interested look
as we HEAR in Kirk's cabin:

UHURA'S INTERCOM VOICE

Uhura at her console, struggling to hear the signal.

KIRK'S INTERCOM VOICE

(Spock is conspicuously absent.)

UHURA
A faint signal from Starfleet,

Thank you.

267   INT. RECREATION DECK                                       267

Decker and "Ilia", the Rec Deck unoccupied but for a
pair of wary SECURITY GUARDS at a very discreet dis-
tance. They are near the pictures of the five Enter-
prises, which should be FEATURED in this SHOT, as
Decker waves his hand about the huge room.

DECKER
The carbon units use this area
for recreation...
(carefully)
What type of recreation does the
crew aboard your vessel enjoy...?

268   CLOSER TWO SHOT (PICTURES O.S.)                            268

As "Ilia" moves on into the room, Decker follows:

"ILIA"
The words 'recreation' and 'enjoy'
have no meaning to my programming.

Decker peers at the lovely android with frustration --
and no little pain, for she is after all the exact
replica of Ilia. She pays not the slightest attention
to Decker's reaction, and begins walking about the Rec
Deck taking in (and, clearly, transmitting all images
to V'ger) the sights. They are near a game area (elec-
tronic games), and now Decker points to one game,
switches it on -- presses button to activate its
LIGHTS and SOUNDS. "Ilia" watches interestedly as
Decker operates the game.

DECKER
Ilia 'enjoyed' this game... she
nearly always won --

And he demonstrates again, as "Ilia" steps to the
device, deftly hits some buttons -- and for just an
instant she turns to Decker with a momentary glimmer
of recognition.

269   INT. KIRK'S CABIN - GROUP WATCHING THE MONITOR             269

McCoy watching with special interest:

McCOY
(approving)
Good! He's using audial-visual
association.

But the words are not out of McCoy's mouth when "Ilia"
says:

"ILIA"
This device serves no purpose.

She steps away from the game; Decker's disappointment
is evident. So is everyone elses.

KIRK
Damn...!

McCOY
(nods grimly)
She needs something else:
something much more personal to
stimulate memory patterns. Something
with a more emotional tie.

Kirk reacts to this, reflective.

270   INT. REC DECK  FULL ON DECKER AND "ILIA"                   270

Decker waving back toward the general area of the
Enterprise pictures.

DECKER
The crews of the previous
Enterprises were also carbon units.
In what way is the life form in
your vessel different?

"ILIA"
Carbon units are not true life
forms... Do those images repre-
sent how Enterprise has evolved
into its present form?

DECKER
(hoping he's struck
a responsive chord)
Yes.

"ILIA"
Carbon units have clearly retarded
Enterprise's proper evolvement.

DECKER
(controlling surprise)
What is Enterprise's proper
evolvement?

"ILIA"
Enterprise should not require
the presence of carbon units.

And with this she moves off, observing other Rec Deck
objects. Decker moves with her; then:

DECKER
(carefully)
Enterprise would be unable to
function without carbon units.

"ILIA"
More data concerning this functioning
is necessary before carbon units can
be patterned for data storage.

271   ACROSS "ILIA" TO DECKER                                    271

as he reacts to this ominous note; he stops abruptly.

DECKER
What does that mean?

"ILIA"
(stopping; almost
pleasantly)
When my examination is complete,
the carbon units will be reduced
to data patterns.

This has been delivered with chilling blandness, and
she stands facing Decker, almost as though waiting for
him to thank her. He thinks fast now.

DECKER
Within you are memory patterns of
a carbon unit. If I can help you
revive these patterns; you could
understand our functions better.

"ILIA"
That is logical. You may procede.

272   ON DECKER                                                  272

realizing the difficult task ahead; the pain he will
suffer.

273   INT. V'GER - ANGLE UP TOWARD ENTERPRISE (M)                273

The ship stationary in the chamber as now we SEE an
exterior hatch sliding fully open. Up through the
hatch a circular airlock door opens -- and a tiny
figure in a thruster spacesuit emerges, steps into
space, slowly floats down through the hatch and under
the Enterprise saucer section. In this and subsequent
VIEWS we will SEE that on the rear pack of his thruster
spacesuit is a FLASHING STROBE LIGHT which regularly
EMITS the identifying SIGNAL of this particular suit.
(By which Kirk will be able to see Spock's position
even from several miles away.)

274   CLOSER ON THE SPACESUITED FIGURE (M)                       274

MOVING TOWARD the CAMERA until the features behind
the face mask are clearly identifiable: Spock, his
face set in the same grim, determined expression, as
he touches his spacesuit transmitter control.

SPOCK
Computer, commence recording.
Captain Kirk -- this message
will detail my attempt to
contact the aliens...

275   INT. BRIDGE                                                275

Kirk ENTERING, crossing Uhura as she calls:

UHURA
Starfleet signals, sir, growing
in strength...
(listening intently)
They -- have Intruder on their
monitors -- it's decelerating --
powerfield cloud beginning to
dissipate...

SULU
Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons
indicate Intruder on a course
into Earth orbit...

CHEKOV
(interrupting)
Sir! Airlock four has been opened;
a thruster suit is reported missing!

KIRK
(reacts knowingly)
Spock...!
(to navigator)
Get a fix on his position!

276   INT. V'GER - MED. ON SPOCK                                 276

His features now set into an almost trance-like expres-
sion as he concentrates on the thought emanations.
Then we SEE his head turn, he peers off -- then he
moves his thruster controls. We SEE the small blue
jets of his thrusters -- his spacesuit figure begins
to move off in the direction he was concentrating
upon.

277   ANOTHER ANGLE - SPOCK                                      277

His thrusters moving him across V'ger's vast chamber
then dropping down into a deep "trough"-like area
which stretches into the distance ahead of him. A
cloud of CRYSTAL FORMS (Kirk's entrapment) become
visible to one side but Spock passes them at some dis-
tance and does not attract them.

We can SEE more clearly now the point on the inner wall
of the trough toward which Spock is heading. It is an
unusual combination of GLOWING FORCEFIELDS which seem
to mark this point of the vessel as of some importance.
(Here, also, we will become aware of "sensor-bee"
swarms, intermittently darting toward this same wall
from all points of the chamber.)

278   INT. AIRLOCK AREA                                          278

SHOWING Kirk in a thruster spacesuit, helmet being
readied by AIRLOCK TECHNICIANS. McCoy is also here,
arguing with Kirk:

KIRK
(from the start)
... I don't want him stopped, Bones;
I want him to lead me to whatever's
out there...!

McCOY
And if that 'whatever' has taken
over his mind....?
KIRK
Then he'll have still led me to
it, won't he?

And Kirk steps into the airlock door, hits a control --
it begins sliding closed behind him.

279   INT. V'GER - ANGLE UP TOWARD ENTERPRISE                    279

UP THROUGH the circular airlock door as it slides open
-- and Kirk's tiny spacesuited figure floats down
clear of the saucer.

280   CLOSER ON KIRK                                             280

SEEING his face through the spacesuit faceplate as he
scans the darkness.

SULU'S VOICE
Bridge, Captain. We make Spock
as 26 Mark 345 degrees off ship's
axis.

During which, Kirk spots something.

281   KIRK'S POV                                                 281

Spock's STROBE blinker at a mile or so distance,
nearing V'ger's inner walls.

282   ANGLE ON KIRK                                              282

KIRK
I have him in sight.

During which, Kirk touches his thruster controls and
blue thruster jet propels him off in the direction
indicated. His thrusters come on for a longer period
of time as he accelerates to the higher speed necessary
to overtake Spock...

283   INT. ILIA'S QUARTERS                                       283

The DOOR SNAPPING open, and "Ilia", McCoy and Decker
entering. Then CAMERA REVEALS Chapel already inside,
looking through some female adornments she's found
there.

CHAPEL
I remember Lt. Ilia once mentioning
that she wore this...

DECKER
(reacting; tight)
... when we met.

Clearly this is very painful to Decker. Meanwhile,
Chapel hands the Deltan headband to "Ilia".

CHAPEL
(gently)
Put it on.

"Ilia" hasn't the slightest idea what to do with the
headband, holds it, runs her fingers over the jewels
and feathers embedded into it. Chapel takes it from
her, places it on 'Ilia's" head, now switches on the
light illuminating the dressing table mirror -- stands
behind her with Decker, both watching apprehensively.

284   ANGLE ON "ILIA"                                            284

studying her image in the mirror, her face totally
blank a moment, but then breaking into a bemused
frown -- as though trying to remember. And:

CHAPEL
(helpfully)
Ilia...

DECKER
(quiet; urging)
On Delta... remember...?

And it seems that "Ilia" does remember. She peers at
her image, then sets the headband into its exact
proper position. Then she turns and looks at them
with recognition.

"ILIA"
(haltingly)
Dr. Chapel...

285   ACROSS CHAPEL TO DECKER                                    285

as Chapel smiles, pleased, and looks at Decker who
stares at "Ilia" nonplussed. This is Ilia coming
alive!

"ILIA"
(to Decker)
"Will..."

And she touches his hand, runs her own hand over it,
and smiles.

Decker is completely overwhelmed, struggles for words
and looks to McCoy for some kind of help. McCoy
realizes Decker is losing himself in fantasy.

McCOY
(gently reminding)
Commander... this is a mechanism...

Decker is startled, and for another slit-second he's
lost -- but then he realizes the reality, and what he
should do:
DECKER
(gently; but urgingly)
Ilia, help us make direct contact
with V'ger...

"ILIA
I... cannot.

Decker looks at "Ilia's" hand still resting on his.
Then:

DECKER
Then tell us who V'ger is; where
he's from... W need your help.

For another moment "Ilia" continues smiling at Decker,
holding his hand. Then, abruptly, the smile vanishes
-- the hand is released. Clearly, she's again the
probe, as:

"ILIA"
Why have two carbon units entered
V'ger...?

Decker glances at McCoy, who shakes his head almost
imperceptibly: he doesn't know. But Decker has an
obvious reply:

DECKER
They want to make contact with
V'ger...
(trying to revive
"Ilia's" memory again;
touches her hand)
Ilia...

"Ilia" peers at him blankly, allows him to continue
touching her hand, but obviously it means nothing to
her.

DECKER
(continuing;
distressed,
to "Ilia")
Does V'ger object to the presence
of the two carbon units?

"ILIA"
The carbon units are of no
consequence; V'ger will determine
their purpose.

McCOY
Their purpose is to survive.

"ILIA"
That is also V'ger's purpose.

Decker's face reflects his bemusement:

DECKER
You said V'ger's purpose was to
find and join with the Creator.

"ILIA"
That is how V'ger will survive.

286   ON DECKER                                                  286

as now, the bemusement changes to just the slightest
enlightenment.

"ILIA"
I wish to continue my observations.

287   INT. V'GER - KIRK MANEUVERING WITHIN THE CHAMBER           287

Kirk but a small object, thruster jets occasionally
spurting as he guides himself deeper into the trench
as he continues forward progress in the direction he
saw Spock taking.

288   CLOSER ON KIRK                                             288

So we can SEE his face (through the plate), as he looks
ahead into the distance toward Spock.

289   KIRK'S POV (O)                                             289

Spock's STROBE signal closer and Spock's tiny space-
suited figure now becoming dimly visible as he moves
steadily toward the GLOWING FORCEFIELDS of the inner
wall.

290   ON KIRK                                                    290

His attention fixed on Spock, he never notices until
an instant too late an O.S. object; quickly he hits a
thruster control, and we SEE the MANEUVERING JET turn
him to the side as:

291   WIDER ANGLE - KIRK AND THE BLOB FORMATION (O)              291

A swarm of strange-looking translucent crystal-like
FORMS on a collision course with Kirk. (NOTE: They
were traveling randomly, and are not deliberate ob-
structions. However, Kirk's nearness now has attracted
them and the swarm of them heads in his direction.
Kirk tries to avoid them; he hits a second MANEUVERING
JET -- but he overcompensates, and spins straight into
the intercepting swarm of them.

292   MED. SHOT - KIRK (O)                                       292

as the nearest crystal forms WHIP INTO SHOT, adhering
to Kirk's spacesuit. He hits full MANEUVERING JETS
now, seems to make some escape, but still more forms
WHIP IN, adhere.

KIRK
Bridge...!

293   INT. BRIDGE - EMPHASIZING HELM                             293

All eyes anxiously on the O.S. main viewer.

KIRK'S VOICE
... stand by, I may be in trouble...

Sulu hits the viewer magnification control.

294   ANGLE TO MAIN VIEWER (M)                                   294

As the distant STROBE FLASHES of Kirk's spacesuit are
MAGNIFIED CLOSER, pulling Kirk into MEDIUM LONG SHOT.
We can SEE the details of the swarm of forms adhering.
But we can SEE that Kirk's spacesuit is now about half
covered with them!

294A   REVERSE ANGLE                                             294A

Expressions of bridge crew to reflect the horror of
what they're seeing as:

SULU
Your phaser, Captain...!
Use your phaser...!

KIRK'S VOICE
(transmitter, weak)
Can't... reach... phas --
(transmission breaks
off in heavy STATIC)

CHEKOV
Airlocks two and four --
prepare to launch rescue
teams!
(glancing at viewer)
Chief Lang! Get them out
there! Fast!

SULU
Mr. Spock, the Captain is in
trouble, directly behind you --
three hundred meters!
(beat)
Mr. Spock!

Looks of distress are exchanged.

295   INT. V'GER - SPOCK                                         295

Spock's spacesuited figure MOVING TOWARD the CAMERA,
as we HEAR:

KIRK'S VOICE
(weak; STATIC)
... Spock...! ... need help...!
... trapped...!

No indication at first that Spock has heard; his face
set with determination, his eyes fixed on his destin-
ation: the inner wall.

KIRK'S VOICE
(continuing; weakening;
STATIC)
... pressure on me...! ... can't
move...! Spock...!

296   ON SPOCK - CLOSE                                           296

as Kirk's VOICE STOPS -- and all that is heard now
is the HEAVY STATIC crackling ominously. Spock's
expression flickers, then he hits reverse thruster
JETS, stops -- he turns to glance at the inner wall,
then his thrusters turn him so he can look back the
way he came from. But he cannot resist Kirk's call;
he suddenly hits his thruster controls, then JETS
FLARE, and:

297   WIDER ANGLE - SPOCK                                        297

as thruster JETS accelerate him back toward Kirk.

298   INT. BRIDGE - VIEWER (M)                                   298

showing Kirk's spacesuit completely covered, encased
in the blob. Kirk is no longer moving. But in the
distance, facing toward him is Spock!

299   INT. V'GER - KIRK AND SPOCK                                299

with Spock in the near distance, heading TOWARD the
CAMERA. As he approaches Kirk, Spock brings out his
phaser. Now he hits the controls for the REVERSE JETS --
he slows RAPIDLY as he approaches Kirk's now complete-
ly encased spacesuit. Spock makes a quick phaser
adjustment.

300   ANGLE ON SPOCK AND KIRK'S ENCASED SPACESUIT (O) (S)        300

Spock levels the phaser carefully. FIRES. The PHASER
BEAM strikes the blob form -- it SHATTERS, the pieces
DISINTEGRATING.

301   INT. V'GER - SPOCK AND KIRK                                301

facing each other while hovering in space.

KIRK
Bridge, cancel rescue teams.
(hard)
Spock, what in the hell are you
doing out here!

SPOCK
I am seeking answers, Captain.

KIRK
(with insight)
Answers to what, Spock? Our
dilemma -- or your personal one?

Spock does not immediately reply, peers at Kirk through
the faceplate a long beat, then abruptly looks away,
points off into the distance:

302   ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING INNER WALL (O)                   302

We can SEE what appear to be SPARKLING GLOBULES OF
LIGHT darting toward the inner wall in the distance,
then disappearing there. (We'll SEE other swarms
occasionally too, coming from different directions --
they will later be identified as "sensor swarms" on
closer examination.)

SPOCK
(pointing)
Captain, I believe there we will
find an indication of whoever --
or whatever -- is aboard this
vessel...

Kirk weighs alternatives, then pushes his thruster
controls and begins moving in the direction Spock
indicated.

Their thruster jets flash, propel them toward the
point on the inner wall.

303   INT. V'GER - AT INNER WALL                                 303

The most prominent area of the vast inner wall -- the
patterns on the wall here seem to GLOW with life.
The spacesuited figures of Kirk and Spock ENTER SCENE,
gliding slowly toward what seems to be the central
part of theses patterns.

304   CLOSER ON KIRK AND SPOCK                                   304

as they approach and then we SEE the brief REVERSE
THRUSTERS and then forward momentum stops; motionless.
Then Spock sees something, indicates.

305   LONG ANGLE TO INCLUDE SENSOR SWARM (O)                     305

Now, we SEE that they are tiny, multi-colored points
of FLASHING LIGHT -- almost like swarms of bees.
They approach the inner wall at this central point
and seem to "disappear" through the orifice.

306   KIRK AND SPOCK - ANOTHER "SWARM" APPROACHING (O)           306

This "sensor swarm" has been coming from a direction
that will take them close past Kirk and Spock. Then,
as it passes, Spock reaches out quickly, grabs.
He turns to Kirk, his hand closed on something.

307   CLOSE ON KIRK AND SPOCK (AGAINST "TUBE" WALL)              307

Spock opens his hand, retaining a hold on something
with his fingers. He brings it up to Kirk's face mask
-- it's a tiny SENSOR, its multi-colors flashing as it
tries to escape from Spock's fingers. And in this CLOSE
VIEW, we SEE that this is a SENSOR very much like the
one we've seen earlier embedded in the Ilia-probe's
throat hollow. Then Spock releases it and it darts
to join the sensor swarm near the opening of the inner
wall.

308   KIRK AND SPOCK'S POV (O)                                   308

From this closer distance, we SEE that an opening ap-
pears in the wall, admits the sensor swarm, then closes
immediately.

309   BACK TO SHOT                                               309

Kirk and Spock exchange a look. Their thruster JETS
ignite briefly, moving them in that direction.

310   INT. V'GER - KIRK AND SPOCK (O)                            310

closely approaching the inner wall now, timing their
movements to coincide with the arrival of another
"swarm" -- the wall begins OPENING. The "swarm"
through, the wall begins CLOSING -- but Spock and
Kirk slip in before it closes.

311   INT. "MEMORY CAVE" - SPOCK AND KIRK                        311

The wall closing behind them, they are safely inside.
But as they stop their forward momentum, their eyes
widen with awe and surprise at what they are seeing:

311A   WHAT THEY SEE (M)                                         311A

The long "cave" chamber with its row of huge MEDIATOR
BALLS extending into the distance. To one side, the
gleaming CRYSTAL MEMORY WALL.

311B   KIRK AND SPOCK                                            311B

as Spock makes a quick analysis and estimate of what
they are seeing. Then, he takes out his tricorder
again, propels himself toward the memory crystals.
Kirk follows.

311C   AT MEMORY CRYSTAL                                         311C

as Spock adjusts his tricorder through several readings.

SPOCK
It would appear that the atomic
arrays of these crystals store
information. A remarkably
efficient system.

KIRK
(indicates)
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect
that data, carry it here.

SPOCK
(nods; indicates)
New crystals: they must contain
the most recent data obtained --

And Spock touches one of these new crystals (it will be
shinier, more pulsating than the others): ANOTHER

RAPID
PROFUSION OF FAINT IMAGES, but this time including a
pattern-like image of Klingons, Klingon vessels (the
ones destroyed by the Cloud), and obvious Starfleet
personnel -- and the Epsilon 9 station. Also, a

pattern
of the Security Guard killed by the probe. And Ilia.

KIRK
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station
... and Ilia!! They seem to be
more than just images...

SPOCK
(agreeing)
Exact patterns. The energy bolt
that hit them wasn't simply a
weapon -- it dematerialized them,
stored them. But why?

And he turns and begins moving on, studying the wall,
consulting his tricorder.

312   ACROSS THEM TO ANOTHER SECTION OF THE WALL                 312

Spock inspecting this area at which the "newer" crystals
are PULSATING and GLOWING, and which appears to be a
termination of the Crystal area, continuing on and dis-
appearing through the wall.

KIRK
If this is their ship's data
banks, where is the crew? Or
is their entire ship automated?

SPOCK
Captain, I do not believe there
is a crew -- or that this is a
vessel as such.

A beat, as Kirk reacts incredulously.

SPOCK
(continuing)
I am almost certain now that all
of this is V'ger -- I believe
that we are inside a life form,
a living machine.

Spock turns his spacesuit, turns his tricorder out to-
ward the Mediator Balls, takes a reading in that di-
rection. Then a glance to Kirk.

SPOCK
I must attempt mindmeld with it,
Captain.

Spock touches his spacesuit controls; the THRUSTER
JETS move him out toward the Mediator Balls.

KIRK
(warningly)
Spock...

313   ANGLE AT MEDIATOR BALL                                     313

Spock reaching the Ball, halts his momentum and removes
one gauntlet, baring his hand. Stretching the bare
hand toward a part of it which looks strangely "alive."
The very power generated from this area is clearly
affecting Spock's hand. Meanwhile, Kirk has used his
THRUSTERS to join him.

KIRK
Spock, if you're right, its mind
may be enormous...

But Spock pays him no attention, his entire being now
focused on the PULSATING GLOW of the "alive" area --
the CAMERA MOVING IN CLOSER TO Spock, as he forces his
hand toward that surface, closer, closer.

314   KIRK                                                       314

watching, almost mesmerized. Torn between wanting to
pull Spock away from the wall -- and knowing that
Spock must go through with it. For everyone's sake.

315   CLOSER ON SPOCK                                            315

preparing for the ordeal, moving his hand to the "liv-
ing area," the invisible force even stronger -- but
Spock's strength unwavering, and now he touches the
surface -- and it FLARES WITH STRANGE ENERGY at the
touch. And at the same moment Spock' body convulses
as if tens of thousands of volts of electricity are
charging through him.

316   CLOSE ON SPOCK'S FACE                                      316

as he begins to shudder with the shock, the CAMERA
CONTINUES INTO EXTREME CLOSE-UP as we SEE Spock's mouth
open -- he SCREAMS. CAMERA INTO EXTREME CLOSE SHOT OF
SPOCK'S EYES.

317   CAMERA ZOOM - THROUGH SPOCK'S EYES                         317

MUSIC IN AND UP as we travel through ABSTRACT IMAGES
(per Con Pederson discussion). Symbolizing V'ger's
incredible and complex store of mechanistic knowledge,
these IMAGES suggest patterns of atoms, molecules,
galaxies, dimensions of the universe beyond human
knowledge or comprehension. It takes only fifteen or
twenty seconds, but seems to span aeons, taking us
through micro-infinity and macro-infinity.

DISSOLVE TO :

318   INT. DISPENSARY - SPOCK'S EYES                             318

CAMERA BRIDGING BACK OUT THROUGH SPOCK'S EYES AND INTO
ANGLE ON SPOCK'S FACE as he lies in a sickbay bed. His
eyes are open; he is staring straight ahead as if in a
catatonic state, completly unaware of his surroundings.
Then Doctor Chapel leans INTO SCENE, moving a medical
scanner over the brain area.

CHAPEL
Now scanning pons area at spinal
nerve fiber connection...

319   ANGLE ON McCOY AND KIRK                                    319

McCoy at a console, watching readings he is getting
from Chapel's scanner. Kirk watches McCoy anxiously.

McCOY
Indications of some neurological
trauma--the power pouring through
that mind-meld must have been
staggering...

Before Kirk can reply, they HEAR a LAUGH! An abrupt,
harsh, bitter laugh.

320   ACROSS THEM TO SICKBAY                                     320

as all whirl to the patient area where it is obviously
Spock who has just laughed -- but there is no indication
of laughter from him now. A startled Chapel has stepped
back away from the bed. Spock seems to be attempting
to focus, orient himself as Kirk and McCoy hurry to the
bedside.

SPOCK
(quiet)
Jim...

And Spock reaches out a hand weakly., takes a surprised
Kirk's hand in his. McCoy exchanges a surprised glance
with Kirk, as Spock -- clutching Kirk's hand in friend-
ship and need -- struggles to summon strength to speak.

SPOCK
(continuing)
This simple feeling...
(looks at Kirk)
... is so far beyond V'ger's
comprehension.

321   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              321

with Kirk and McCoy exchanging another surprised
glance (at Spock's emotion), with McCoy gesturing Kirk
not to question it.

KIRK
(gently)
Were you right? Spock? V'ger
is a living machine...?

SPOCK
(nodding)
A life form of its own; a
conscious, living entity.

CHAPEL
(reacting)
A living machine...?!

McCOY
(to Chapel)
We're living machines, too: protein
mechanisms.

Kirk nods at McCoy.

KIRK
And it considers the Enterprise a
living machine: that's why the
probe refers to our ship as an
entity.

CHAPEL
If it thinks our ship is alive
what does it think we are?

McCOY
(dryly)
An 'infestation' -- bacteria...
microbes.

322   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              322

as Spock turns to Kirk.

SPOCK
I saw V'ger's planet: a planet
populated by living machines.
Unbelievable technology.
(pained)
V'ger has knowledge that spans this
universe.
And... in all this order... all
this magnificence, V'ger feels
no awe...no delight... no beauty...
(a beat; exhausted)
I should have known...

Kirk waits for Spock to continue, but Spock seems too
weak.

KIRK
Know what, Spock? What?

But Spock falls back, exhausted -- and McCoy gently
tugs at Kirk, AD-LIBBING, "Let him rest, Jim..."
Kirk shrugs McCoy away, addresses Spock:

KIRK
(continuing)
What should you have known?

SPOCK
(weak)
No meaning... No hope...
(summoning strength)
And, Jim, no answers...!
Jim, it's looking for answers
itself!

KIRK
What answers?

SPOCK
'Is this all I am? Is there not
more?'

Just then an INTERCOM SIGNAL:

UHURA'S VOICE
A faint signal from Starfleet,
sir! Intruder Cloud has been
located on their outer monitors
for past twenty-seven minutes...
dissipating rapidly as it approaches.

Immediately, Sulu's voice:

SULU'S VOICE
Starfleet reports forward velocity
has slowed to sub-warp speed! We
are three minutes from Earth's
orbit!-

KIRK
(into intercom)
I'll be right there...
(to Chapel; crisp)
I need Spock on the bridge.

323   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              323

as Chapel urns to a MED TECH, AD LIBS an order,
"Dalaphaline, twenty cc's..." As the Tech quickly sets
the hypo-injector, and hands it to Chapel - and she
injects Spock, the hypo emitting a fast, QUIET HISS --
Kirk gazes at Spock just an instant as Spock breathes
deeply, the drug clearly strengthening him. Chapel
and the Tech help Spock from the bed, as Kirk addresses
McCoy:

KIRK
A machine planet...? Sending a
machine to Earth looking for its
Creator...?

McCOY
God.

Kirk looks at him, then at Spock -- on his feet now --
then at McCoy again:

KIRK
'To find the Creator,' the probe
said. Find God...?

McCOY
Isn't that what we're all trying
to do...?
(dryly)
All us machines...?

Kirk stands facing him another moment, then whirls
and steps to the monitor, flips some buttons, and
peaks into his communicator.

KIRK
Mr. Chekov, Commander Decker's
present location?

CHEKOV'S VOICE
He... they... are in Engineering,
sir.

KIRK
(into intercom)
I want to make a ship's announcement.
But it's to be heard only in
Engineering.

UHURA'S VOICE
Ready, Captain.

KIRK
(voice amplified)
This is the Captain speaking. It
appears that the alien ship...
V'ger... is NOT a manned vessel...

324   ENGINEERING                                                324

SHOWING Scott (at his console) listening to Kirk's
words -- and facing Decker and "Ilia" who are just
about to leave Engineering. (In b.g. the Engine core
GLOWS the appropriate color, and there is a SOFT
HUM of IDLE POWER.) Kirk's VOICE continues:

KIRK'S VOICE
(amplified)
It is a living entity...! A machine
life form. We are attempting to
ascertain its intentions. All
personnel will maintain yellow alert
status!

325   CLOSER ON DECKER AND "ILIA"                                325

The probe bland as usual, but Kirk's words seem to
have strangely elated Decker; he says to her:

DECKER
A machine...! Then it had to be
programmed. By whom...?

"ILIA"
By the Creator.

DECKER
(probing)
To join, and become One with the
Creator?

"ILIA"
To learn all that is learnable;
to deliver all collected data to
the Creator on the third planet.
That is the programming.

326   INCLUDE SCOTT                                              326

just now confronting them, regarding "Ilia" with open
disapproval.

SCOTT
Well, sir, now what about all that?
A living entity, the Captain says...
entity... A living thing...!

Decker really hasn't heard Scott; he's gazing at "Ilia,"
attempting to digest what she's just said. But quickly:

DECKER
Thank you, Scotty...

He moves to leave.

SCOTT
(dourly)
Your welcome, sir.

Now Decker and "Ilia" move toward the exit, Scott gaz-
ing after them glaringly, watching "Ilia's" every
move. Suddenly, almost into the corridor, "Ilia" turns
and looks back at the engine room. She addresses
Decker, but load enough for Scott to overhear:

"ILIA"
There is no logical reason for
carbon units to control Enterprise's
power systems.

SCOTT
(to "Ilia")
Lassie, if I were functioning
'logically,' right now I'd be
showing you the inside of our
scrap metal compactor!

327   INT. BRIDGE                                                327

Kirk with McCoy and Spock, who although somewhat shaky,
is clearly more alert. They are just assuming their
stations.

UHURA
We're now locked into Starfleet's
transceivers; Admiral Nogura has
received your reports, sir.

328   ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWER (O)                                 328

Kirk pausing halfway to his chair to study the viewer
on which is appearing an IMAGE of V'ger looming omi-
nously in orbit over Earth.

UHURA
The visual is a lunar monitor
relay, sir.

As they begin to study it, the IMAGE suddenly distorts and
is replaced by signal interference -- SIGNAL STATIC LINES
RUNNING ACROSS THE VIEWER SCREEN.
(Somewhat resembling the kind of high voltage interference
some-times seen on the television screen.)

UHURA
(continuing)
Heavy interference, sir -- it's
coming from here, inside the
intruder itself...

Uhura hits buttons and immediately from the speakers we
HEAR A SERIES OF CARRIER WAVE BEEPS. Spock looks up from
his console, listens to it.

SPOCK
Puzzling! The interference
appears to be a rather simple
carrier wave code signal...

UHURA
On an old style radio frequency,
sir...

329   PAST KIRK TO THE ELEVATOR                                  329

as the doors snap open and Decker and "Ilia" appear.
All eyes go to them as:

"ILIA"
(to Decker;
interrupting)
As I stated, V'ger calls to the
Creator.

DECKER
(nods; turns to Kirk)
V'ger is announcing that it has
arrived, sir -- that it's ready
to deliver the information it
was programmed to collect...

"ILIA"
'To learn all that is learnable.'

DECKER
(to Kirk)
It expects a return signal now,
ordering it to transmit that
information to the Creator.

UHURA
(whirling)
Sir! V'ger's signals have
stopped...

"ILIA"
(as if frightened)
Decker... The Creator has not
responded.

Kirk hears this, turning inquiringly toward her, but
Uhura interrupts:

UHURA
Picking up Starfleet again; a
lunar monitor relay...

330   ANGLE INCLUDING VIEWER (O)                                 330

as, indeed, the interference is fading and a new Main
Viewer IMAGE is appearing -- it shows V'GER IN EARTH
ORBIT with a strange looking OBJECT moving away from
V'ger. It is an ominous looking, HUGE SWIRLING GREEN
MASS -- it resembles the same green plasma-energy bolts
that destroyed the Klingons and Epsilon 9 -- and very
nearly the Enterprise. It is not a bolt now -- the mass
is much larger and appears much more deadly. A second
object has now formed and moves off, a third one begins
to appear. (Meanwhile, the first and second PLASMA-
ENERGY OBJECTS are moving off into the distance in
different direction.)

McCOY
My God! They're the same kind
of things that destroyed the
Klingons, Epsilon Nine...

SPOCK
(interrupting; from
science console)
These read as identical composition...
(turns to Kirk)
... however, Captain, they measure
several hundred times more
powerful!

KIRK
High mag, Mr. Sulu!

Sulu adjusts the viewer through several IMAGE MAGNI-
FICATIONS until we SEE the huge OMINOUS GREEN DEVICES
more clearly.

SULU
The third one is moving off too --
a fourth one is forming...

UHURA
(overlapping)
Urgent signal from Starfleet,
Captain!
(turns, shaken)
All Earth defense systems have
gone dead.

Kirk reacts hard at this. Uhura gets another message.

UHURA
(continuing)
Sir, Starfleet computes their
trajectories as moving toward
equidistant positions over Earth.

331   ANOTHER ANGLE - KIRK AND SPOCK                             331

exchanging significant glances.

SPOCK
From four equidistant positions,
Captain, a detonation would blanket
the entire surface of the planet.

DIFALCO
I plot them as reaching equidistant
positions in... twenty-nine
minutes, sir... mark!

332   ACROSS KIRK TO DECKER AND "ILIA"                           332

as Kirk vaults from his chair, strides to a handrail to
confront the "Ilia"-probe.

KIRK
Why...?!

"ILIA"
The carbon-units infection will
now be removed from the Creator's
planet.

KIRK
Why?!

"ILIA"
The Creator has not answered.

KIRK
The carbon-units are not
responsible for that.

"ILIA"
You infest and control Enterprise.
V'ger believes carbon-units interfere
with the Creator in the same manner.

SPOCK
(to Kirk)
Then V'ger believes the Creator to
be a machine too.

DECKER
(nods)
It seems we all imagine God in our
own image.

333   ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER - INCLUDING CHEKOV (O)                333

Three of the four OMINOUS SWIRLING GREEN OBJECTS have
all moved away from V'ger now, in different directions,
growing smaller in the distance. The fourth object is
holding position nearby, seeming to grow in size and
intensity.

334   ANGLE EMPHASIZING KIRK                                     334

as he throws a look toward Spock who is now in deep
meditation. Kirk turns and takes "Ilia's" shoulders
and carefully turns her to face him.

McCOY
'... similar life forms...?'
Jim, V'ger's saying the Creator
is a machine...!

DECKER
(grimly amused)
Of course: we all create God
in our own image.

Kirk peers at Decker a moment, ingesting this thought.
Then he addresses "Ilia" again, this time with emotion:
after all, he is pleading for the survival of the
entire planet:

KIRK
V'ger! If we are lesser beings,
we are still, like you, living.
And because we are alive, we --
like you -- wish to survive.
You must not destroy --

Kirk pauses abruptly: "Ilia" is regarding him blandly,
stonily -- not the slightest reaction or response;
clearly Kirk's plea is being ignored.
Kirk draws in his breath to continue, realizes the
futility, turns helplessly to Spock.

335   ACROSS KIRK TO SPOCK                                       335

who has been listening intently, with near fascination
-- an idea forming in his mind. Quickly, he steps
down to Kirk:

SPOCK
(quiet, terse)
Captain...
(reaches Kirk)
Treat V'ger as you would... a
child.

336    FAVORING KIRK                                             336

startled at this, not sure he's heard correctly.

KIRK
Child...!?

SPOCK
Yes, Captain, a child: evolving
into adulthood -- learning, searching
-- instinctively needing.

DECKER
(intrigued)
Needing what...?

McCOY
Spock, this 'child' is about
to eliminate all life on Earth;
how do we teach it that that's
'wrong'? With a spanking...!?

Spock peers at McCoy almost sadly, then replies to
Decker.

SPOCK
It doesn't know what it needs,
Comm          ander...
(to Kirk)
It does not know.

Kirk says nothing, looks at Spock who is awaiting a
reaction; then Kirk glances at "Ilia" -- his brain
is racing, struggling to reach a decision. And then:

KIRK
(abruptly to
"Ilia")
The carbon--units-know-why-the
Creator-has-not-responded.

McCOY
(shocked)
Jim...!

DECKER
(to "Ilia,"
urgingly)
Ilia... we can help V'ger
find what it needs --

"Ilia" studies Decker just a bland beat, then turns
to Kirk:

"ILIA"
(to Kirk, hard)
Disclose the information.

KIRK
(cool, calm)
Not until V'ger withdraws the
devices orbiting the third planet.

"ILIA"
KIRK UNIT! DISCLOSE THE
INFORMATION!

Kirk studies her a moment, then decides to press his
bet:

KIRK
(to "Ilia," almost
pleasant)
No.
(then to crew
commandingly)
Secure all stations. Clear
the bridge.

A moment where all are startled at this order -- but
no time for questions as just then the ship is ROCKED
BY A FURIOUS POWERFUL ERUPTION NEARBY within V'ger.

DECKER
(amplified)
Bridge to all decks,secure
your stations.

McCOY
Your child is having a
tantrum, Spock.

SULU
Clear the bridge, Captain...?

KIRK
That was the order, Mr. Sulu:
Clear the bridge.

Just then another ERUPTION -- the ship is ROCKED AGAIN.

337   INT. INSIDE V'GER - THE ENTERPRISE                         337

rocked about by the furious powerfields -- with
frightening displays of ray energy.

338   INT. BRIDGE                                                338

as all react to the powerful blasts, holding on to
railings, etc, at the same time attempting to secure
their stations for the evacuation. The DAMAGE REPAIR
TECHNICIAN leaves his station, crossing to exit.

DAMAGE TECH.
(leaving bridge;
to Captain)
Severe stress on engine pylons,
sir.

"ILIA"
(to Kirk; flat)
V'ger requires the information.

Kirk merely looks at her, then to the evacuating crew:

KIRK
Bridge secure all stations!
Move out!

McCOY
Jim, what the hell kind of
strategy is this...?

Meanwhile, Decker has crossed to Chekov's now abandoned
console, checks it.

DECKER
All ship's functions going to
automatic, Captain.

339   ANGLE ON KIRK                                              339

turning to confront "Ilia":

KIRK
If V'ger destroys the Enterprise,
the information V'ger requires
will also be destroyed.

339A   INCLUDING VIEWER                                          339A

as LIGHT SHOW outside perceptically recedes, and simul-
taneously the ROCKING CEASES. At the same time, "Ilia"
is saying:

"ILIA"
It is illogical to withhold
required information.

Kirk does not reply to this, turns away to observe
the withdrawing crew. Most are out; only Spock,
Decker and McCoy remain behind -- with McCoy on his
way. The bridge lighting dims, and now Kirk looks at
Spock, who nods approvingly; clearly Spock is the only
person who seems to comprehend what Kirk is doing, and
why. As Kirk now moves toward the exit, and the lights
are dimmed even further:

"ILIA"
(almost polite)
Kirk-unit, why do you not
disclose information?

KIRK
Because V'ger is going to
destroy all the carbon units
on the third planet.

"ILIA"
They have repressed the Creator.

KIRK
The information will not be
disclosed.

And, gesturing the others ahead of him, Kirk starts
toward the bridge elevator. "Ilia" calls after him:

"ILIA"
(almost a plea)
V'ger needs the information.

340   AT THE ELEVATORS                                           340

Decker and McCoy about to enter, Spock and Kirk just
behind -- all stopping abruptly now at "Ilia's" state-
ment. The very tone of her voice is enough for them
to realize they have made a very telling point. Kirk
follows fast:

KIRK
Then V'ger must withdraw its
orbiting devices.

"ILIA"
V'ger will comply if the carbon
units disclose the information.

341   ANGLE ON McCOY                                             341

wryly reacting to this:

McCOY
It learns fast, doesn't it...?

342   ACROSS McCOY TO KIRK AND SPOCK                             342

as Kirk looks at Spock, Kirk's whole expression convey-
ing the obvious question: "What the hell do we do now?"
But Spock is ready with an answer:

SPOCK
Captain, the vessel -- V'ger --
obviously operates from a
central brain complex...

Spock allows the sentence to hang, as he and Kirk
eye each other significantly, the CAMERA SWINGING
OVER TO KIRK so we can perceive that to Kirk this
idea has an even greater significance.

KIRK
(to Spock)
The orbiting devices would be
controlled from the point,
then...?

SPOCK
Precisely.

Kirk nods grimly, faces "Ilia" again; this time
he's playing for all the stakes.

KIRK
The carbon units' information
cannot be disclosed to V'ger's
probe... only to V'ger directly.

343   ANOTHER ANGLE - REACTIONS                                  343

all wait with hushed expectancy, all eyes on "Ilia"
who seems momentarily in some internal communication.

She turns away from Kirk and steps forward looking at
the Main Viewer.

McCOY
(indicating
viewer)
Jim...!

344   PAST THEM TO VIEWER                                        344

the image of the chamber in which the Enterprise is
imprisoned. But now, toward the chamber-end, where
further passage had previously been barred by the lace-
work energy barriers -- an OPENING APPEARS. And at
the same time there is a GENTLE LURCHING EFFECT, and:

DECKER
Forward motion, Captain...!

SPOCK
A tractor beam...

"Ilia" steps down from the platform and into the well
where she is closer to the viewer.

DECKER
Captain, what's the next move?

KIRK
The question is, Mr. Decker, is
there a next move...

345   INT. V'GER - THE ENTERPRISE                                345

moving through the chamber, pulled by the invisible
tractor beam, toward the OPENING -- toward the next
chamber which, from this POV seems even larger,
more forbidding.

346   INT. BRIDGE                                                346

as the four officers step down onto the bridge, Spock
hurrying to his science station, Kirk to the center
seat.

KIRK
Resume duty stations, Mr. Decker.

As Kirk attends to his console, Deck is at an
intercom:

DECKER
(into intercom,
voice amplified)
All personnel resume stations...!

At the same time the lights are brightening -- and
members of the bridge crew begin returning. All this
time there is an ever increasing sense of movement.
Kirk glances at Decker:

KIRK
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my
bluff is being called.

DECKER
I'm afraid our hand is pretty
weak, Captain.
(slight smile)
But it's the only game in town.

Kirk reacts, pleased, a split beat at Decker's "our"
hand, and goes on:

Kirk throws him a look of appreciation, then, abruptly
his manner changes as he addresses Chekov:

KIRK
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices
activate?

CHEKOV
They reach final position in...
Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.

KIRK
(a beat; then into
intercom)
Engineering...

347   INT. ENGINEERING - SCOTT                                   347

at his console, a female engineering technician (CHIEF
ROSS) nearby, the usual engine room ambience in the
b.g., as:

SCOTT
Scott, here, sir.

348   INT. BRIDGE - KIRK WITH AN ANGLE ON SPOCK                  348

as Kirk hesitates, glances around at the crew -- now
all having resumed their stations -- and then grimly
looks at "Ilia" who still remains at the rail.

KIRK
(into intercom,
eyes on "Ilia")
Mr. Scott, be prepared to execute
Starfleet order two zero zero
five.

Hearing this, Spock whirls around -- peers incredulously
at Kirk. He appears for a moment to be incensed at
Kirk's words. Then he realizes and understands Kirk's
position and turns, sadly resigned, back to his work.

349   INT. ENGINEERING                                           349

as Scott, too, hears this, but his reaction is of grim
acceptance. Not so Chief Ross; she is horrified.

SCOTT
(with a glance at
Ross, into intercom)
When, Captain?

KIRK'S INTERCOM VOICE
On my command.

SCOTT
(somberly, into
intercom)
Aye, sir.

And Scott hits buttons on his console, now moves to
step from his station, nearly collides with Ross, who
clearly is bravely struggling to maintain her poise
and dignity:

ROSS
Why has the Captain ordered self-
destruct, sir?

SCOTT
(a beat; gently)
I would say, lass, because he
thinks -- he hopes -- that when
we go up... we'll take V'ger
with us.

ROSS
Will we?

SCOTT
(with grim
satisfaction)
When that much matter and anti-
matter are brought together?
Oh, yes; we will, indeed.

350   EXT. ENTERPRISE - INT. V'GER                               350

The ship passing now through a chamber that is vastly
more active than anything we have previously seen.
Directly ahead appears to be an area that dispatches
powerfields; a tremendous volume of them seem to ema-
nate and converge there. The medium from which the
ship moves appears almost solid, to the point where it
seems incredible that the ship can be pulled through
it at all. The entire chamber pulses with machine-
like, alien life. This should even be evidenced in the
booming POWERFIELD LIGHTENING BOLTS as they course in
ever more frighteningly close proximity to the ship as:

350A   INT BRIDGE - INCLUDING THE VIEWER                         350A

The crew all watching the awesome spectacle of V'ger's
interior (on the viewer) as the Enterprise is being
pulled toward the brain complex. All are somewhat sub-
dued, for all realize how their journey will end -- but
at the same time they also realize there is no other
way. The CAMERA PANS, catching facial reactions -- as,
in the b.g., we HEAR a constant flow of AD-LIBBED crew
comments:

CHEKOV
Twenty-five minutes to device
activation, sir.

ALT. (Twenty-two)
ALT. (Eighteen)

UHURA
Starfleet has been apprised of
our situation, Captain.

SULU
Tractor beam remains constant...

DIFALCO
We are seventeen kilometers inside
the vessel...

351   ANGLE ON SPOCK                                             351

His back to the viewer, the angle does not reveal his
facial features, but we can discern him struggling to
contain his feelings.

352   WIDER ANGLE (INCLUDE KIRK, McCOY, AND DECKER)              352

Kirk's back to Spock as he watches the viewer, Kirk
now turning toward Spock.

KIRK
Spock... Spock...

Spock does not respond, then Kirk reacts with momentary
annoyance, then realizes Spock is totally distracted.
Kirk peers at him a moment, then suddenly rises and
steps up to:

353   SPOCK'S STATION - KIRK AND SPOCK (McCOY IN B.G.)           353

as Kirk arrives, with Spock still facing away from
him, clearly distracted.

KIRK
(starts)
Mr. Spock -- I think...

Spock moves to face him, turning fully INTO the CAMERA
so we can see now, just under Spock's eye:

A tear! Welling fom the eye, rolling down his cheek.
Kirk is speechless a moment, glances at McCoy who has
also witnessed this phenomenon, and started toward
Spock; but Kirk gestures McCoy to stay back, as he
addresses Spock:

KIRK
(quiet, feeling)
Not for us?

SPOCK
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.

Spock pauses as Kirk peers incredulously at him, then
continues:

SPOCK
(continuing)
I weep for V'ger, as I would for
a brother -- far more knowledgeable
than I -- and yet one step behind.

354   ANGLE ON McCOY AND DECKER                                  354

Listening, McCoy's face reflecting concern; Decker's
face compassion and understanding, with Decker step-
ping closer to Spock, as Spock continues:

SPOCK
As I was -- when I came aboard...
so is V'ger now: empty, incomplete.
Searching. Logic and knowledge are
not enough.

McCOY
(with empathy)
Spock, are you saying that you
found, what you needed -- but V'ger
hasn't?

SPOCK
Has not, Doctor -- and now, because
of what we are planning... will not...

KIRK
(almost hard)
There is no alternative.

DECKER
(gently pressing)
Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need
to fulfill itself?

SPOCK
V'ger has begun to understand the
true limits of our universe,
thereby realizing the existence
of other dimensions. To fulfill
itself it must evolve to a
higher dimension; V'ger believes
this can be achieved only by
joining with the Creator.

SPOCK (ALTERNATIVE)
Each of us, at some time in our
life, turns to someone, a father,
a brother, a God and asks 'Why
am I here?' 'What was I meant
to be?' V'ger hopes to touch its
Creator to find its answers.

355   ACROSS KIRK TO DECKER                                      355

as Decker reacts with sudden, almost evangelical en-
lightenment, as Kirk Says:

KIRK
(understanding)
'Is this all that I am? Is there
nothing more?

ON DIFALCO

reacting to the (O.S.) viewer, AD-LIBBING a terse:

DIFALCO
Captain...!

PAST KIRK AND SPOCK TO THE VIEWER

where another opening is suddenly visible -- another
chamber. But the violent and color energy effects of
the previous chambers are no longer evident. Instead,
the entire chamber appears beautifully symmetrical,
with a strange, subdued glow, which increases as we
move closer.

SPOCK
(flat)
Captain, I believe that is our
destination.

356   EXT. ENTERRISE - INT. V'GER - NEAR THE "ISLAND"            356
COMPLEX

This enormous chamber resembles a hemisphere, laced
throughout with dazzling energy patterns, not at all
ominous, but quite lovely in effect. As the Enterprise
continues forward motion, now ahead you will to SEE a
small "island." Floating in the exact center of the
hemisphere, the "island" seems alive with PULSING LIGHT,
with more of the lovely and delicate ENERGY FORMS and
COLORS. On the "island," vague at this distance, ap
pears to be a "solid" matter form.

357   INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING VIEWER                             357

The "island" looming larger in the distance. And the
Enterprise (as evidenced from the viewer) perceptibly
slowing. Kirk just resuming his command chair, as:

SULU
Forward motion slowing, Captain...!

Kirk says nothing a moment, studies the viewer -- and
then:

KIRK
(into intercom)
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?

SCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE
(somber)
We're ready, sir.

KIRK
(into intercom)
Thank you, Scotty. Stand by.

358   ACROSS KIRK TO McCOY                                       358

as Kirk turns from the intercom and glances at McCoy.
Between them a total look of understanding.

359   EXT. ENTERPRISE (INT. V'GER)                               359

The Enterprise approaching the edge of the "island" --
slowing, but still quite clearly being pulled by the
tractor beam. The "solid matter" in the "island" cen-
ter still obscured by the STRANGE LIGHT GLOW emanating
from that area. The Enterprise is now nearly at the
"island" edge.

360   INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING VIEWER                             360

as all watching "island" loom closer and closer.

CHEKOV
Tractor beam strength lessening,
Captain.

KIRK
(into intercom)
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.

SPOCK
(fast)
Captain, the orbital device will     (ALT.)
not be triggered for twenty-two      (nineteen...)
minutes...                           (fifteen...)

KIRK
The point...
(Your)

SPOCK
(eying "Ilia";
carefully)
The point is, Captain, twenty-two    (ALT.

should
minutes. We could have that much      loop "19"  
more time...                                 "15")

Kirk glances at the Viewer, the oncoming "island," then
at Spock:

KIRK
(shakes head, no)
(ALT: "19",)    (Mr. Spock), if we do not provide
(     "15  )    V'ger with certain information, we
won't have twenty-two seconds; the
plan must be implemented upon arrival.

DECKER
Captain, we can't be sure that our...
move... will actually save Earth.

KIRK
No!

Decker's last word is interrupted by an almost gentle
BUMP -- and on the Viewer all perceptible motion has
stopped. At the same time:

SULU
Forward motion stopped, Captain.

CHEKOV
Tractor beam is released.

361   INT. INSIDE V'GER - THE ENTERPRISE AT THE "ISLAND"         361

The ship's sauce leading edge holding position at
the "island" edge as though docked.

362   INT. BRIDGE  "ILIA"                                        362

watching the (O.S.) Viewer.

"ILIA"
(indicating viewer)
V'ger...

363   INCLUDING THE VIEWER  KIRK AND THE OTHERS                  363

all very silent a moment, gazing at the sight. Now
Kirk glances at the people around him: on his command
their lives are about to end. Nothing is said; no
time for it, no inclination to articulate the obvious.
No need to.

KIRK
(into intercom:
with finality)
Mr. Scott...

364   ANGLE ON CHEKOV                                            364

reacting to a console reading with surprise.

CHEKOV
Captain... I read an oxygen and
gravity envelope forming outside
the Enterprise...!

UHURA
Sir, I have located the source
of V'ger's radio signal: (it's)
directly ahead.

SPOCK
That transmitter is a vital link
between V'ger and the Creator.
(its)

DECKER
(urging)
(ALT. "18",)   We have twenty-one minutes. Captain,
(.... "14" )   we can still save V'ger... and ourselves.

All this has caused Kirk to vacillate, but he still
believes his course of action is the proper one, as:-

"ILIA"
The carbon units will now provide
V'ger the required information.

"Ilia" is moving toward the elevator, turning to face
the others as she says this. Kirk remains frozen, his
hand on the intercom button. He glances at McCoy, as
though seeking advice. McCoy peers at him blandly,
levelly; Kirk must follow his own instinct.

365   FAVORING KIRK                                              365

gazing at "Ilia," then at Spock, his brain racing, con-
sidering all the possibilities, options. He glances
at the anxious faces awaiting his decision: a possible
twenty-two more minutes of life -- or instant death.
Another beat as he decides. Then:

KIRK
(into intercom)
Mr. Scott... we're holding off;
there may be a chance...
(rises, gestures
Spock and McCoy)
Spock, Bones...

He starts for elevator.

366   PAST DECKER TO KIRK                                        366

as Kirk strides toward the elevator, joining McCoy and
Spock.

KIRK
Mr. Decker... I will contact you
every five minutes. Otherwise...
inform Mr. Scott immediately.

DECKER
(calls after him)
Captain... I'd like to go along...

Kirk studies Decker a beat -- there is something com-
pelling about Decker's manner -- a certain sense of
absolute necessity. Kirk seems about to deny the re-
quest, then turns to Sulu:

KIRK
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn...

And Kirk leaves; Decker, his face reflecting a strange,
almost eager gratification, hurries after him.

KIRK
V'ger plans to literally meld
to reduce both itself and the
Creator to patterns...

SPOCK
... and then to reassemble itself
combined with the Creator. The
most certain way of obtaining
all the Creator's answers.

A sudden STORM OF LIGHT AND STRANGE SOUND. In the
midst of it, Kirk finds a SHAFT OF LIGHT very much
centering on him. He sees "Ilia" watching him with
none of their "former navigator" in her expression
now. Kirk hesitates, gathering his thoughts:

KIRK
(to "Ilia")
Our data is being prepared.

"ILIA"
Answer!

KIRK
We will answer and present proof
of our answer when it is ready!

Kirk's words lead to a suggestion of FRUSTRATION in the
STORM OF LIGHT AND SOUND around them.

KIRK
(continuing)
V'ger, we will bring the Creator
to you! Here!

367   ANGLE EMPHASIZING "ILIA" AND DECKER                        367

as he moves to her:

DECKER
We need only a few more minutes.
Believe me...

Decker has reached out to touch her -- the probe spins
at his touch -- the move knocks Decker from his feet,
tumbling, a hard fall. Then the robe looks at him
lying there -- just the slightest softening of her
features now.

368   EMPHASIZING DECKER                                         368

slowly turning to face the probe again.

DECKER
Ilia, believe me... the Creator
will appear!

369   EMPHASIZING "ILIA"                                         369

as she meets Decker's look, her expression softening
still more. The STORM OF LIGHT and SOUND begins to
subside a bit. She moves to him and he gets to his feet.

UHURA'S INTERCOM VOICE
Enterprise to Captain...

370   INT. BRIDGE                                                370

Uhura with Sulu and Chekov there.

UHURA
Problem, Captain: the response
signal is not in our records.
Voyager Six was sent out by Earth's
"United States Subdivision.' The
code was probably...

371   INT. VOYAGER SIX SITE                                      371

as Uhura continues:

UHURA'S INTERCOM VOICE
... kept secret to keep Voyager's
data from rival subdivisions.

McCOY
That's preposterous! They
wouldn't have kept scientific
data from one another.

CHEKOV'S INTERCOM VOICE
We are now checking with Starfleet
Archives, Captain. Stand by.

372   ANGLE ON DECKER AND "ILIA"                                 372

Kirk, Spock and McCoy are standing some distance from
them (out of hearing). The probe is clearly moving
into still closer touch with Lt. Ilia's memory patterns
as Decker takes her hand.

DECKER
And when V'ger melds? What will
happen to you?

"ILIA"
It will... take me from you...

373   KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY                                      373

McCoy is looking at Kirk with an incredulous expression
on his face.

McCOY
And when it realizes what the
Creator is...?

KIRK
There's no way to know. V'ger
expected it to be a machine --
some single entity.
(indicates entire
site)
All of us here may be reduced
into patterns...

SPOCK
That seems to be what it has
planned -- to have the Creator
physically present here.

McCOY
(small smile)
The God it captures is going to
be a hell of a disappointment.

374   DECKER AND "ILIA"                                          374

at the side of Voyager Six, Decker in the midst of
twisting a wing-nut which releases a hatch which swings
open. Decker peers inside while "Ilia" waits.

375   KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY                                      375

Decker and "Ilia" at the old capsule in b.g. as Kirk
looks that way.

KIRK
Commander...

We SEE Decker look up at Kirk's call, then ignore him
and go back to inspecting inside the access hatch. At
this moment, from Kirk's communicator, a SIGNAL.

KIRK
(continuing;
into communicator)
Kirk here.

UHURA'S INTERCOM VOICE
We now have the response code,
sir.

KIRK
Stand by. Transmit it on my
orders.

The three of them exchange looks -- Kirk, Spock and
McCoy exchanging a silent moment of friendship and
resignation. Then Kirk lifts his communicator again:

KIRK
(continuing)
Enterprise... transmit.

376   DECKER AND "ILIA"                                          376

catching Decker in the midst of pressing a control on
his tricorder. Both he and "Ilia" are watching Kirk
and the others closely. Now Decker looks down at the
tricorder's face. He nods:

DECKER
Recording...

377   KIRK, SPOCK AND McCOY                                      377

still waiting. They continue to wait. McCoy shifts
uncomfortably, throws Kirk a puzzled glance. Kirk
finally lifts his communicator.

KIRK
Enterprise, are you transmitting?

UHURA'S INTERCOM VOICE
Affirmative, Captain. For some
time now.

KIRK
Confirm code and transmitting
frequency.

CHEKOV'S INTERCOM VOICE
Both signal and frequency
confirmed, sir.

DECKER
(calling)
Captain Kirk!

378   VARIOUS ANGLES                                             378

as the others turn to Decker and "Ilia."

DECKER
(continuing)
The fault is here, sir, not in
the transmission.
(indicating into
hatch)
The antenna leads have been
disconnected. V'ger never
intended to accept a transmitted
signal.

KIRK
Capture God! In order to
retrieve V'ger's data, the
Creator has to physically come
here!...

DECKER
And plug the signal directly into
the circuitry at this...
(indicates into
access)
... point here, Captain. It
should pick up even a tricorder
playback.

KIRK
(lifting communicator)
Enterprise, I want that signal
again. Transmit!

Then Kirk touches a control on his tricorder exactly
as Decker did earlier. Then he looks up, reacts as
he sees Decker holding his own tricorder up -- and a
smile playing on Decker's face.

379   ACTION ANGLE                                               379

as Kirk suddenly pivots, races toward Decker -- but he
passes too close to the "Ilia"-probe. It sends him
spinning back, tumbling to his knees.

380   AT KIRK                                                    380

as KIRK starts up to scramble to his feet but Spock has
stepped in, putting a hand on Kirk's shoulder and re
straining him.

SPOCK
Jim... he wants it.

DECKER
You got the Enterprise, it's
what you wanted. This is what
I want.
(smiles)
But, Jim...
(now very seriously)
... I'm the right choice for this
mission.

And then Decker shoves the tricorder into the access
hatch.

381   VARIOUS EFFECTS SHOTS - DECKER BEING FUSED - V'GER         381
TRANSCENDING (S)

For just an instant nothing happens -- and then a
BLINDING SHAFT OF LIGHT STRIKES Decker. The color
becomes BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER, begins spiraling through
the room. "Ilia" stes toward Decker, is caught in the
LIGHT, and instantly VANISHES in a BRILLIANT WHITE GLOW.

We SEE Decker seeming to grow larger -- as if his
molecular pattern is expanding. A SPECTACULAR SERIES
OF VISUALS., THE SPIRALING LIGHT enveloping the entire
area.

All this emanating from Decker's body, becoming LARGER
-- also BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER until now it is almost
transparent. And the SPIRALING now expanding in all
directions, and the room itself starting to dissolve,
vanishing into nothingness -- and all commencing to
slip into the new dimension.

Kirk, Spock and McCoy stand transfixed another instant.
Around them, V'ger seems to be TRANSFORMING INTO BRIL-
LIANT, LOVELY PATTERNS. They all turn and race into
the complex in the direction of their vessel.

382   EXT. EARTH ORBIT - AN ENERGY BOLT (S)                      382

It too seems to be flowering into loveliness, brilliant,
graceful patterns as they seem to slip through to another
dimension, vanishing.

383   EXT. V'GER - FULL SHOT                                     383

The "FLOWERING" EFFECT now spreading outward, V'ger's
massive shape becoming a spiraling pattern of twisting,
graceful shapes and brilliant colors -- a transcendence
into another dimension.
And then all of that is left is a shimmering, jewel-like
point of light -- and then it too fades -- and reveals
there in the blue-black of space, the U.S.S. Enterprise.

384   INT. BRIDGE - INCLUDING THE VIEWER (O)                     384

which shows now only space and its familiar star
patterns. All gaze at the viewer, awed at what they've
seen and undergone. They exchange looks silently, no
one wanting to be the first to try to comment on some-
thing which is beyond mere words. We HEAR an ELEVATOR
DOOR, Scott and Chapel ENTER the bridge and stand
silently watching.

McCOY
Well, it certainly has been...
interesting.

KIRK
Spock, we were its answer!

SPOCK
(nods)
Yes, Captain. It needed our
mortality, the fear of it, our
struggle against it, our fears,
our dreams...

KIRK
... and the 'foolish' emotions
which drive us?

SPOCK
(looks at Kirk; then)
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase
-- 'the divine restlessness of
the human spirit.'

McCOY
Spock... you're quoting poetry?

Spock's cold look at McCoy is interrupted by:

UHURA
Starfleet signal, Captain!
Return to orbital dockyard for
inspection.

KIRK
Ignore that signal.
(to Scott)
Shall we give the Enterprise a
proper shakedown, Mr. Scott?

SCOTT
(suddenly beaming)
I'd say it's time for that, I
would, sir.
(toward Spock)
We can have you back on Vulcan
in four days, Mr. Spock.

SPOCK
(coolly)
I have no business on Vulcan,
Engineer.

Kirk and Spock exchange a look -- then Kirk turns to
the helm.

KIRK
Ahead Warp One, Mr. Sulu.

DIFALCO
Heading, sir?

KIRK
(taking center seat;
indicates generally)
Out there.  Thataway.

SPOCK
(nods gravely)
A most logical choice, Captain.

Then the trace of a smile comes over Spock's face.

385   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE (S)                                385

Planet Earth in the distance, and receding in size as
the starship heads out the other direction.

FADE OUT.

Episode VI
RETURN OF THE JEDI

Luke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine in an
attempt to rescue his friend Han Solo from the clutches of the vile
gangster Jabba the Hutt. Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE
has secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even
more powerful than the first dreaded Death Star. When completed, this
ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of Rebels
struggling to restore freedom to the galaxy...

PAN DOWN to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star, its massive
superstructure curling away from the completed section like the arms of
a giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast, floats the small,
green moon of ENDOR.

An Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the massive armored
space station, followed by two zipping TIE fighters. A small Imperial
shuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and hustles toward the
Death Star.

2    INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT
The shuttle captain makes contact with the Death Star.

SHUTTLE CAPTAIN
Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting
our approach. Deactivate the security shield.

DEATH STAR CONTROLLER (filtered VO)
The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have
confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to
proceed.

SHUTTLE CAPTAIN
We're starting our approach.

3    INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

Operators move about among the control panels. A SHIELD OPERATOR hits
switches beside a large screen, on which is a display of the Death
Star, the moon Endor, and a bright web delineating the invisible
deflector shield.

A control officer rushes over to the shield operator.

OFFICER
Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.

OPERATOR
Yes, sir.

The control officer moves to a view port and watches as the Imperial
shuttle lands in the massive docking bay. A squad of Imperial
stormtroopers moves into formation before the craft.

4    INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY

The DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, a tall, confident technocrat,
strides through the assembled troops to the base of the shuttle ramp.
The troops snap to attention; many are uneasy about the new arrival.
But the Death Star commander stands arrogantly tall.

The exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a WHOOSH, revealing only
darkness. Then, heavy FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. From this
black void appears DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH. Vader looks over the
assemblage as he walks down the ramp.

JERJERROD
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your
presence.

VADER
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you
back on
schedule.

The commander turns ashen and begins to shake.

JERJERROD
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.

VADER
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.

JERJERROD
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.

VADER
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.

JERJERROD
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.

VADER
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.

JERJERROD  (aghast)
The Emperor's coming here?

VADER
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your
apparent lack of progress.

JERJERROD
We shall double our efforts.

VADER
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as
I am.

5    EXT ROAD TO JABBA'S PALACE - TATOOINE

A lonely, windswept road meanders through the desolate Tatooine
terrain. We HEAR a familiar BEEPING and a distinctive reply before
catching sight of ARTOO-DETOO and SEE-THREEPIO, making their way along
the road toward the ominous palace of Jabba the Hutt.

THREEPIO
Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and
poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.

Artoo whistles timidly.

THREEPIO
Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this
Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit.

The two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.

THREEPIO
Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.

6    EXT JABBA'S PALACE - GATE

Threepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then timidly
knocks on the iron door.

THREEPIO  (instantly)
There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master
Luke.

A small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery mechanical
arm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops out and inspects
the two droids.

STRANGE VOICE
Tee chuta hhat yudd!

THREEPIO
Goodness gracious me!

Threepio points to Artoo, then to himself.

THREEPIO
Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.

The eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then the
eye zips back into the door. The hatch slams shut. Artoo beeps his
concern.

THREEPIO
I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go.

Artoo beeps his reluctance as Threepio turns to leave. Suddenly the
massive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic SCREECH. The
robots turn back and face an endless black cavity. The droids look at
one another, afraid to enter.

Artoo starts forward into the gloom. Threepio rushes after his stubby
companion. The door lowers noisily behind them.

THREEPIO
Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should
rush into all this.

Artoo continues down the corridor, with Threepio following.

THREEPIO
Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!

7    INT JABBA'S PALACE - HALLWAY

The door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark
passageway. The frightened robots are met by two giant, green GAMORREAN
GUARDS, who fall in behind them. Threepio glances quickly back at the
two lumbering brutes, then back to Artoo. One guard grunts an order.
Artoo beeps nervously.

THREEPIO
Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my!
Oh! Oh, no.

Walking toward them out of the darkness is BIB FORTUNA, a humanlike
alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.

BIB
Die Wanna Wanga!

THREEPIO
Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master,
Jabba the Hutt.

Artoo lets out a series of quick beeps.

THREEPIO  (cont)
...and a gift.
(thinks a moment, then to Artoo)
Gift, what gift?

Bib shakes his head negatively.

BIB
Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.

Bib holds out his hand toward Artoo and the tiny droid backs up a bit,
letting out a protesting array of squeaks. Threepio turns to the
strange-looking alien.

THREEPIO
He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.

Bib thinks about this for a moment.

THREEPIO
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort
of things.

Bib gestures for the droids to follow.

BIB
Nudd Chaa.

The droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness, trailed
by the two guards.

THREEPIO
Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.

8    INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM

The throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque CREATURES
ever conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio seem very small as
they pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber. Light shafts
partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna crosses the
room to the platform upon which rests the leader of this nauseating
crowd: JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of the galactic underworld is a
repulsive blob of bloated fat with a maniacal grin. Chained to the
horrible creature is the beautiful alien female dancer named OOLA. At
the foot of the dais sits an obnoxious birdlike creature, SALACIOUS
CRUMB. Bib whispers something in the slobbering degenerate's ear. Jabba
laughs horribly, at the two terrified droids before him. Threepio bows
politely.

THREEPIO
Good morning.

JABBA
Bo Shuda!

The robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose-skinned
villain.

THREEPIO
The message, Artoo, the message.

Artoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head,
creating a hologram of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over ten
feet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space gangsters.

LUKE
Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke
Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are
powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally
powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's
life.
(Jabba's crowd laughs)
With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which
will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant
confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift:
these two droids.

Threepio is startled by this announcement.

THREEPIO
What did he say?

LUKE  (cont)
... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.

THREEPIO
This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.

Luke's hologram disappears.

Jabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in Huttese.

JABBA  (in Huttese subtitled)
There will be no bargain.

THREEPIO
We're doomed.

JABBA  (in Huttese subtitled)
I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he
is.

Jabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the throne.
Hanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw him last, is a
carbonized HAN SOLO.

THREEPIO
Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.

9    INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR

One of Jabba's Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio down a dank,
shadowy passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of unspeakable
creatures bounce off the cold stone walls. Occasionally a repulsive arm
or tentacle grabs through the bars at the hapless droids. Artoo beeps
pitifully.

THREEPIO
What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did?
He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!

A large tentacle wraps around Threepio's neck. He manages to break
free, and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor.

10   INT BOILER ROOM

The door slides open, revealing a room filled with steam and noisy
machinery. The guard motions them into the boiler room, where they are
met by a tall, thin humanlike robot named EV-9D9. Behind the robot can
be seen a torture rack pulling the legs off a screaming baby work
droid. A second power droid is upside down.  As smoking branding irons
are pressed into his feet, the stubby robot lets out an agonized
electronic scream. Artoo and Threepio cringe as the guard grunts to EV-
9D9.

NINEDENINE
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?

THREEPIO
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...

NINEDENINE
Yes or no will do.

THREEPIO
Oh. Well, yes.

NINEDENINE
How many languages do you speak?

THREEPIO
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can
readily...

NINEDENINE
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got
angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.

THREEPIO
Disintegrated?

NINEDENINE  (to a Gamorrean guard)
Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining
bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.

The guard shoves Threepio toward the door.

THREEPIO  (disappearing)
Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!

Artoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. Then he beeps
angrily.

NINEDENINE
You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have
need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in
nicely.

The poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured
electronic scream.

11   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM

The court of Jabba the Hutt is in the midst of a drunken, raucous
party. Sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as Oola and a
fat female dancer perform in front of Jabba's throne.

Jabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in his eye beckons
Oola to come and sit with him. She stops dancing and backs away,
shaking her head. Jabba gets angry and points to a spot next to him.

JABBA
Da Eitha!

The lovely alien shakes her head again and screams.

OOLA
Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...

Jabba is furious and pulls her toward him, tugging on the chain.

JABBA
Boscka!

He pushes a button and, before the dancer can flee, a trap door in the
floor springs open and swallows her up. As the door snaps shut, a
muffled growl is followed by a hideous scream. Jabba and his monstrous
friends laugh hysterically and several revelers hurry over to watch her
fate through a grate.

Threepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of Han
Solo, but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen. An
unnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering. On the far side of the
room, the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow the approach of two
guards followed by BOUSHH, an oddly cloaked bounty hunter, leading his
captive, Han Solo's copilot, CHEWBACCA THE WOOKIEE.

Bib takes his place next to his disgusting master, and whispers into
his ear, pointing at Chewbacca and the bounty hunter. Jabba listens
intently, then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster and speaks a
greeting in a strange, electronically processed tongue (Ubese).

BOUSHH  (in Ubese subtitled)
I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.

THREEPIO
Oh, no! Chewbacca!

JABBA  (in Huttese subtitled)
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

Jabba lets out a loud, long, blood-curdling laugh and turns to
Threepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys.

THREEPIO
Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!

Jabba continues speaking, as Threepio nervously translates. Boushh
listens, studying the dangerous creatures around the room. He notices
BOBA FETT standing near the door.

THREEPIO
Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the
reward of twenty-five thousand.

BOUSHH  (in Ubese subtitled)
I want fifty thousand. No less.

Jabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid off the
raised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. Boushh adjusts his
weapon as Jabba raves in Huttese and Threepio struggles back onto the
throne. The disheveled droid tries to compose himself.

THREEPIO
Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?
(to Boushh)
Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.

The bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand. Threepio
looks at it, then looks at Jabba, then back to the bounty hunter. The
droid is very nervous and Jabba is getting very impatient.

THREEPIO
Because he's holding a thermal detonator.

The guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the
room. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the
bounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a tense hush. Jabba
stares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across
his vast mouth and he begins to laugh.

JABBA  (in Huttese subtitled)
This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.

Jabba continues.

THREEPIO
Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.

Bib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his
reaction. Boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator and it goes
dead.

BOUSHH
Zeebuss.

THREEPIO
He agrees!

The raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and
applause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca
growls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as a
skiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and dancing
girls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the loudly
appreciative creatures.

Boushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the
scene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across
the room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts slightly, cradling
his weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance.

12   INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR AND CELL

Gamorrean guards lead Chewie down the same hallway we saw before. When
a tentacle reaches out at the Wookiee, Chewie's ferocious ROAR echoes
against the walls and the tentacle snaps back into its cell in terror.
It takes all the guards to hurl Chewie roughly into a cell, slamming
the door behind him. Chewie lets out a pathetic howl and bangs on the
iron door.

13   EXT JABBA'S PALACE

The palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset. On the road in
front, a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out for a desert
rodent and burps in satisfaction.

14   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

Silence. The room is deserted, only the awful debris of the alien
celebration giving mute witness to the activity here before. Several
drunk creatures lie unconscious around the room, snoring loudly.

A shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the perimeter of
the room and is revealed to be Boushh, the bounty hunter. He picks his
way carefully through the snoring, drunken monsters.

Han Solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the wall, his
coffin-like case suspended by a force field. The bounty hunter
deactivates the force field by flipping a control switch to one side of
the coffin. The heavy case slowly lowers to the floor of the alcove.

Boushh steps up to the case, studying Han, and then turns to the
controls on the side of the coffin. He activates a series of switches
and, after one last hesitant look at Han, slides the de-carbonization
lever. The case begins to emit a sound as the hard shell covering the
contours of Han's face begins to melt away. The bounty hunter watches
as Han's body is freed of its metallic coat and his forearms and hands,
previously raised in reflexive protest, drop slackly to his side. His
face muscles relax from their mask of horror. He appears quite dead.

Boushh's ugly helmet leans close to Han's face listening for the breath
of life. Nothing. He waits. Han's eyes pop open with a start and he
begins coughing. The bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn.

BOUSHH
Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.

Han touches his face with his hand and moans.

BOUSHH
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.

HAN
I can't see.

BOUSHH
Your eyesight will return in time.

HAN
Where am I?

BOUSHH
Jabba's palace.

HAN
Who are you?

The bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head,
revealing the beautiful face of PRINCESS LEIA.

LEIA
Someone who loves you.

HAN
Leia!

LEIA
I gotta get you out of here.

As Leia helps her weakened lover to stand up, the relative quiet is
pierced by an obscene HUTTESE CACKLE from the other side of the alcove.

HAN
What's that? I know that laugh.

The curtain on the far side of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba the
Hutt, surrounded by Bib and other aliens. He laughs again, and his
gross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee.

HAN
Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I
got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.

Jabba laughs.

JABBA  (in Huttese subtitled)
It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but
now you're Bantha fodder.

HAN
Look...

JABBA  (cont Huttese subtitled)
Take him away!

The guards grab Han and start to lead him away.

HAN
Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here.
Don't be a fool!

Han is dragged off, as Lando quickly moves forward and attempts to lead
Leia away.

JABBA  (in Huttese subtitled)
Bring her to me.

Jabba chuckles as Lando and a second guard drag the beautiful young
princess toward him. Threepio peeks from behind a monster and quickly
turns away in disgust.

LEIA
We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...

JABBA  (in Huttese subtitled)
I'm sure.

Inexorably her lovely face moves to within a few inches of Jabba's ugly
blob of a head, and Leia turns away in disgust.

LEIA
Ugh!

THREEPIO
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.

15   INT DUNGEON CELL

The heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks open. A
guard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell and the door
slams shut behind him, leaving only a thin sliver of light from a crack
in the door. Han is trying to collect himself when suddenly a growl is
heard from the far side of the cell. He jumps back against the cell
door and listens.

HAN
Chewie? Chewie, is that you?

The shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward Han, lifting
him off the ground with a big hug that carries them into the light,
revealing Chewie.

HAN
Ah! Chew--Chewie!

The giant Wookiee barks with glee.

HAN
Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?

Chewie barks an excited blue streak.

HAN
Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less
rescue anybody.

Chewie barks a reply.

HAN
A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets
delusions of grandeur.

Chewie growls insistently. He holds Han to his chest and pets his head.

HAN
I'm all right, pal. I'm all right.

16   INT MAIN GATE AND HALL - JABBA'S PALACE

Noisily, the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding LIGHT
and reveal the silhouetted figure of LUKE SKYWALKER. He is clad in a
robe similar to Ben's and wears neither pistol nor laser sword. Luke
strides purposefully into the hallway. Two giant guards move to block
Luke's path. Luke halts.

Luke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who immediately
lower their spears and fall back. The young Jedi lowers his hand and
moves on down the hallway.

Bib Fortuna appears out of the gloom. He speaks to Luke as they
approach each other, but Luke doesn't stop and Bib must reverse his
direction and hurry alongside the young Jedi in order to carry on the
conversation. Several other guards fall in behind them in the darkness.

LUKE
I must speak with Jabba.

Bib answers in Huttese, shaking his head in denial. Luke stops and
stares at Bib; he raises his hand slightly.

LUKE
You will take me to Jabba now!

Bib turns in hypnotic response to Luke's command, and Luke follows him
into the gloom.

LUKE
You serve your master well.

Bib responds.

LUKE
And you will be rewarded.

17   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM

Jabba is asleep on his throne, with Leia lying in front of him.
Salacious sits by Jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. Leia is now
dressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs from a
manacle necklace at her throat to her new master, Jabba the Hutt.
Threepio stands behind Jabba as Bib comes up to the gangster slug.

THREEPIO
At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.

BIB
Master.

Jabba awakens with a start and Bib continues, in Huttese.

BIB
...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.

JABBA  (in Huttese subtitled)
I told you not to admit him.

LUKE
I must be allowed to speak.

BIB  (in Huttese subtitled)
He must be allowed to speak.

Jabba, furious, clobbers Bib and shoves him away.

JABBA  (in Huttese subtitled)
You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.

Luke stares hard at Jabba.

LUKE
You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.

JABBA  (in Huttese subtitled)
Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.

LUKE
Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either
profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not
to underestimate my powers.

Jabba's laugh is mean and loud. Threepio attempts to warn Luke about
the pit.

THREEPIO
Master Luke, you're standing on...

JABBA  (in Huttese subtitled)
There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.

Luke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies
into Luke's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as Jabba raises his
hand.

JABBA
Bascka!

The floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the hapless guard into
the pit. The pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the ceiling. Jabba
laughs and his courtiers join in. Leia starts forward but is restrained
by a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks at
him and he shakes his head "no."

18   INT RANCOR PIT

Luke and the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a chute into the
dungeonlike cage. Luke gets to his feet as the guard yells hysterically
for help. A crowd gathers up around the edge of the pit as the door in
the side of the pit starts to RUMBLE open. The guard screams in panic.
Luke looks calmly around for a means of escape.

THREEPIO
Oh, no! The Rancor!

At the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged
RANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and tries
futilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him.

The Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to scramble, the
Rancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws. A few
screams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The audience cheers
and laughs at the guard's fate.

The monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes away just
ahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of
an earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings him up to his
salivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges the bone in the
monster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. The monster bellows in
rage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an
avalanche.

The monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who squeezes
into a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the monster to the
holding cave beyond. On the far side of the holding cave is a utility
door--if only he can get to it. The Rancor spots Luke and reaches into
the crevice for him. Luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it
down on the Rancor's finger.

19   HOLDING TUNNEL - RANCOR PIT

The Rancor lets out a loud howl as Luke makes a run for the holding
cave. He reaches the door and pushes a button to open it. When he
succeeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him and safety. Beyond
the gate two guards look up from their dinner. Luke turns to see the
monster heading for him, and pulls with all his might on the gate. The
guards move to the gate and start poking at the young Jedi with spears,
laughing.

Luke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to reach for
him. Suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up the wall.
As the Rancor moves in for the kill, Luke picks up a skull from the
cave floor and hurls it at the panel. The giant overhead door comes
crashing down on the beast's head, squashing it like a sledgehammer on
an egg.

A startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. There's consternation
at this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba, who is actually turning
red with anger. Leia cannot suppress her joy. Jabba utters harsh
commands to his guards and they hurry off.

JABBA  (in Huttese subtitled)
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.

21   INT RANCOR PIT

The Rancor KEEPERS have come into the cage and are examining their dead
beast. One of them breaks down and weeps. The other glares menacingly
at Luke, who is unworried. Several guards rush into the holding tunnel
and take Luke away.

22   INT THRONE ROOM

The crowd of creepy courtiers parts as Han and Chewie are brought into
the throne room, and other guards drag Luke up the steps.

LUKE
Han!

HAN
Luke!

LUKE
Are you all right?

HAN
Fine. Together again, huh?

LUKE
Wouldn't miss it.

HAN
How are we doing?

LUKE
The same as always.

HAN
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?

Luke looks to Leia.

LEIA
I'm here.

Threepio is standing behind the grotesque gangster as he strokes Leia
like a pet cat. Several of the guards, including Lando, bring Luke from
the other side of the room. Boba is standing behind Jabba.

Threepio steps forward and translates for the captives.

THREEPIO
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed
that you are to be terminated immediately.

HAN
Good, I hate long waits.

THREEPIO
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of
Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

HAN  (to Luke)
Doesn't sound so bad.

THREEPIO
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as
you are slowly digested over a thousand years.

HAN
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?

Chewie barks his agreement.

LUKE
You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever
make.

Jabba cackles evilly at this.

As the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room, a loud cheer
rises from the crowd. Leia and Chewie exchange concerned looks, but
Luke Skywalker, Jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile.

23   EXT TATOOINE SEA - SKIFF

Jabba's huge SAIL BARGE moves above the desert surface accompanied by
two smaller Skiffs. One of the skiffs glides close, revealing Luke,
Han, and Chewie -- all in bonds -- surrounded by guards, one of whom is
Lando in disguise.

HAN
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a
big light blur.

LUKE
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.

HAN
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.

LUKE
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.

HAN
Oh... great!

24   INT BARGE OBSERVATION DECK

Jabba the Hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity ship. His
entire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and having a good time.
Leia is watching her friends in the skiff when the chain attached to
her neck is pulled tight and Jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to
him.

JABBA  (in Huttese subtitled)
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

Threepio wanders among the Sail Barge aliens, bumping into a smaller
droid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place. The stubby
droid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles.

THREEPIO
Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?

Artoo beeps a quick reply.

THREEPIO
Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous.
They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!

Artoo whistles a singsong response.

THREEPIO
Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.

25   EXT SARLACC PIT

The convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. The Sail Barge stops to one
side of the depression, as does the escort skiff. But the prisoner's
skiff moves out directly over the center and hovers. At the bottom of
the deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous-lined hole, surrounded by
thousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is the SARLACC. A plank is
extended from the edge of the prisoner's skiff. Guards release Luke's
bonds and shove him out onto the plank above the Sarlacc's mouth.

26   EXT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK

Jabba and Leia are now by the rail, watching. Threepio leans forward
and the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. As Threepio steps
up to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm and the motley array of
intergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's voice is amplified across
loudspeakers.

THREEPIO
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die
honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba
the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.

27   EXT SKIFF

Han steps forward arrogantly and begins to speak.

HAN
Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get
no such pleasure from us. Right?

Chewie growls his agreement.

LUKE
Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.

Lando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as Luke shoots a quick look
of conspiracy to him.

28   INT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK

The assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as Artoo zips
unnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck. Jabba's laughter subsides as
he speaks into the comlink.

JABBA  (in Huttese subtitled)
Move him into position.

Jabba makes a thumbs-down gesture. Leia looks worried.

29   EXT BARGE - UPPER DECK

Artoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the pit.
Below, in the skiff, Luke is prodded by a guard to the edge of the
plank over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks up at Artoo, then gives a
jaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been waiting for. A flap
opens in Artoo's domed head.

JABBA  (in Huttese subtitled)
Put him in.

30   EXT SKIFF - PLANK

Luke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the
bloodthirsty spectators. But, before anyone can even perceive what is
happening, he spins around and grabs the end of the plank by his
fingertips. The plank bends wildly from his weight and catapults him
skyward. In midair he does a complete flip and drops down on the end of
the plank in the same spot he just vacated, but facing the skiff. He
casually extends an open palm and -- his lightsaber, which Artoo has
sent arcing toward him, drops into his hand.

With samurai speed, Luke ignites it and attacks the guard who prodded
him off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming overboard. The
other guards swarm toward Luke. He wades into them, lightsaber
flashing. Lando struggles with another guard at the back of the skiff.

31   EXT SARLACC PIT

A bewildered guard lands in the soft, sandy slope of the pit, and
begins sliding. He claws desperately as a Sarlacc tentacle grabs him
and pulls him screaming into the viscous mouth.

32   INT SAIL BARGE

Jabba watches this and explodes in rage. He barks commands, and the
guards around him rush off to do his bidding. The scuzzy creatures
watching the action from the window are in an uproar.

33   EXT SKIFF

Luke knocks another guard off the skiff and into the waiting mouth of
the Sarlacc. He starts to untie Chewie's bonds.

LUKE
Easy, Chewie.

At that moment, the deck gunmen on the barge unleash a series of blasts
from a big cannon on the upper deck. Lando is tossed from the deck of
the rocking skiff. He manages to grab a rope, and dangles desperately
above the Sarlacc pit.

LANDO
Whoa! Whoa! Help!

34   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE

With two swift strides, the dangerous Boba Fett ignites his rocket
pack, leaps into the air, and flies from the barge down to the skiff.

35   EXT SKIFF

Boba lands on the skiff and starts to aim his laser gun at Luke, who
has freed Han and Chewie from their bonds. But before Boba can fire,
the young Jedi spins on him, lightsaber sweeping, and hacks the bounty
hunter's gun in half.

Immediately, the skiff takes another direct hit from the barge's deck
gun. Shards of skiff deck fly. Chewie and Han are thrown against the
rail.

HAN
Chewie, you okay? Where is he?

The Wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain.

HAN
I'm okay, pal.

For a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires a
cable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in a strong
cable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from
the wrist down.  Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight
up to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable
and stands free.

Another blast from the Barge's deck gun hits near Boba and he is
knocked unconscious to the deck, next to where Lando is hanging.

LANDO
Han! Chewie?

HAN
Lando!

Luke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets
him. The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their weapons, moves
in on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the incoming second skiff. The young
Jedi leaps into the middle of the second skiff and begins decimating
the guards from their midst.

Chewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to Han,
guiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of the guards.
Han searches the deck as Chewie barks directions; finally he grabs hold
of the spear.

Boba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. He looks over at the
other skiff, where Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba raises his
arm, and aims his lethal appendage.

Chewie barks desperately at Han.

HAN
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?

The space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his hand
whacks squarely in the middle of Boba's rocket pack.

The impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba blasts
off, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing against the
side of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the pit. He screams
as his armored body makes its last flight past Lando and directly into
the mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The Sarlacc burps. Chewie growls a
weak congratulations to Han.

36   INT SAIL BARGE

Leia turns from the spectacle outside, leaps onto Jabba's throne, and
throws the chain that enslaves her over his head around his bulbous
neck. Then she dives off the other side of the throne, pulling the
chain violently in her grasp. Jabba's flaccid neck contracts beneath
the tightening chain. His huge eyes bulge from their sockets and his
scum-coated tongue flops out. The Exalted Hutt's huge tail spasms
through its death throes and then slams down into final stillness. Leia
struggles to free herself of her bondage.

37   EXT SKIFF

Luke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards' skiff, as Han
extends his spear downward to Lando, who is still dangling precariously
from a rope on the prisoner's skiff.

HAN
Lando, grab it!

LANDO
Lower it!

HAN
I'm trying!

A major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. Han
and almost everything else on board slides overboard. The rope breaks,
and Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit. Luckily, Han's foot
catches on the skiff railing and he dangles above Lando and the pit.
The wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit
from the deck gun rocks the skiff violently.

HAN
Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.

Chewie grabs hold of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han
extends the spear toward Lando, who is clutching to the side of the
pit.

HAN
Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!

Luke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the deck
gun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the
skiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail
Barge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up
the hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his
head. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks
the helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit.

The injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling Han, who
is in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate Lando. The Baron
has stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the Sarlacc pit by
lying very still. Every time he tries to reach for Han, the loose sand
moves him closer to his final reward.

HAN
Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!

Another blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let
go of the spear.

LANDO
Hold it! Whoa!

Again Han extends the spear toward Lando.

HAN
Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.

Lando screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly
around his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit.

HAN
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.

LANDO
No, wait! I thought you were blind!

HAN
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.

LANDO
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!

Han adjusts his aim as Lando lowers his head, and the fuzzy-eyed pirate
fires at the tentacle. Direct hit. The tentacle releases Lando, and
Chewie starts to pull them on board the skiff.

HAN
Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!

38   EXT UPPER DECK

The deck gunners have Chewie and the desperate dangling human chain in
their gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention:
Luke, standing before them like a pirate king, ignites his lightsaber.
The deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young
Jedi has demolished them. Immediately, Luke turns to see two more
gunners (who have been uncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge)
racing for him, firing their laser pistols.

39   INT SAIL BARGE - OBSERVATION DECK

Leia is struggling against her chains in desperation as Artoo zips
through the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue; the stubby
little droid extends a small laser gun and blasts the chain apart.

LEIA
Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.

Artoo and Leia race for the exit, passing Threepio, who is kicking and
screaming as Salacious Crumb, the reptilian monkey- monster picks out
one of the golden droid's eyes.

THREEPIO
Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!

Artoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a scream,
crashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio (with his eye
dangling from a wire) hurry off.

40   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE

Luke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded by
guards and fighting like a demon. Leia emerges onto the deck as Luke
turns to face another guard.

LUKE  (to Leia)
Get the gun! Point it at the deck!

Leia turns toward the barge cannon, climbs on the platform, and swivels
the gun around.

LUKE
Point it at the deck!

A laser blast hits Luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in pain,
but manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the
guards. He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. He
flexes the hand; it still works.

Near the rail of the upper deck, Artoo and Threepio steady themselves
as Threepio gets ready to jump. Artoo beeps wildly.

THREEPIO
Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.

Artoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself,
tumbling toward the sand.

Luke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun, which she
has brought around to point down at the deck.

LUKE
Come on!

Luke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. He gathers
Leia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun. The gun
explodes into the deck as Luke and Leia swing out toward the skiff.

41   EXT SKIFF

Han leans panting against the rail as Chewie helps Lando onto the deck.
Luke and Leia land on the skiff with flair.

LUKE
Let's go! And don't forget the droids.

LANDO
We're on our way.

The Sail Barge is exploding in stages in the distance. Half of the huge
craft is on fire.

42   EXT SAND DUNE

Threepio's legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed. Next
to it, Artoo's periscope is the only thing above the sand. The skiff
floats above them and two large electromagnets dangle down on a wire.
With a loud CLANG, both droids are pulled
from the sand.

43   EXT DUNE SEA

The little skiff skips around the burning Sail Barge, which continues
its chain of explosions. As the skiff sails off across the desert, the
barge settles to the sand and disappears in one final conflagration.

44   EXT DUNE SEA - LANDING AREA

A ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the ROAR, we HEAR
THE VOICES of our heroes. They emerge slowly from the veil of sand,
pressing on against the wind. First come Artoo and Threepio, followed
by Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Lando come into view, each
supporting one side of the towering Chewbacca, who hobbles from his
wound.

Soon, they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing sand. It
is the Millennium Falcon and, parked beside it, Luke's trusty X-wing
and a two-seated Y-wing. They must shout to be heard.

HAN
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!

LEIA
That's all any of us can see.

HAN  (blinking)
Then I guess I'm getting better.

As soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the Falcon, the wind
dies down to something more describable as a severe weather condition.
Threepio hits a switch, and the gang-plank lowers with a HUM.

HAN  (turning to Luke)
I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.

LUKE  (shrugging it off)
I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.

HAN
No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest
thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide
awake nothing!

Luke nods, as Chewie growls affectionately at the young Jedi warrior,
mussing his hair like a proud uncle. And Leia warmly hugs him.

LUKE  (moving to his ship)
I'll see you back at the fleet.

HAN
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?

LUKE
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.

Luke and Artoo take off in their spacecraft.

HAN
(looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's
betrayal and subsequent aide)
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.

LANDO
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the
rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.

LEIA
He means "You're welcome."

LANDO
Come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball.

44A  EXT SPACE ABOVE TATOOINE

The desolate yellow planet fills the screen, Luke's X-wing appears and
peels off to the left. A moment later, the FALCON appears as a dot and
grows huge, to roar directly over the CAMERA.

45   INT X-WING - COCKPIT

Luke is at the controls, with Artoo attached behind him outside the
canopy. Luke speaks into his comlink to the others, in the MILLENNIUM
FALCON.

LUKE
I'll meet you back at the fleet.

LEIA  (over comlink)
Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.

LUKE
I will.

HAN  (over comlink)
Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.

A message from Artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front of
Luke. He smiles at the monitor and speaks to Artoo, as he pulls a black
glove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand.

LUKE
That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a
promise to keep... to an old friend.

46   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR AND ENDOR

A Super Star Destroyer and several ships of the Imperial Fleet rest in
space above the half-completed Death Star and its green neighbor,
Endor. Four squads of TIE fighters escort an Imperial shuttle toward
the Death Star.

47   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO DOCKING BAY

Lord Vader strides down the hallway, accompanied by a very nervous
Death Star commander.

48   INT DOCKING BAY - DEATH STAR

Thousands of Imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth
docking bay. Vader and the officer walk to the landing platform, where
the shuttle is coming to rest.

The shuttle's ramp lowers and the Emperor's Royal Guards come out and
create a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops move to rigid attention
with a momentous SNAP.

Then, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears. He is a
rather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame slowly makes its way
down the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. He wears a hooded cloak
similar to the one Ben wears, except that it is black. The Emperor's
face is shrouded and difficult to see, except for his piercing yellow
eyes. Commander Jerjerrod and Darth Vader kneel to him. The Supreme
Ruler of the galaxy beckons to the Dark Lord.

EMPEROR  (to Vader)
Rise, my friend.

Vader rises and falls in next to the Emperor as he slowly makes his way
along the rows of troops. Jerjerrod and the other commanders stay
kneeling until the Supreme Ruler and Vader, followed by several
Imperial dignitaries, pass by; only then do they join in the
procession.

VADER
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.

EMPEROR
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.

VADER
Yes, my Master.

EMPEROR
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does,
you must bring him
before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the
dark side of the
Force.

VADER
As you wish.

EMPEROR
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.

He laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of Imperial
troops.

49   EXT YODA'S HOUSE - DAGOBAH

Once again, Artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp environs of
the swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. He beeps
disconsolately to himself and turns to look at Yoda's cottage. Warm
yellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to fight the gloom.

50   INT YODA'S HOUSE

The tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen floor of
the cottage. Our view travels up the stick to the small green hand that
clutches it, and then to the familiar face of YODA, THE JEDI MASTER.
His manner is frail, and his voice, though cheerful, seems weaker.

YODA
Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?

Luke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and, indeed, his look
has been woeful. Caught, he tries to hide it.

LUKE
No... of course not.

YODA  (tickled, chuckles)
I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak.
(Points a crooked finger)
When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?

Yoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed.

YODA
Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.

Yoda sits himself on his bed, with great effort.

LUKE
Master Yoda, you can't die.

YODA
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me
and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the
Force.

LUKE
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.

YODA
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.

Yoda sighs, and lies back on his bed.

LUKE
Then I am a Jedi?

YODA  (shakes his head)
Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then,
only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.

Luke is in agony. He is silent for a long moment, screwing up his
courage. Finally he is able to ask.

LUKE
Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?

Yoda's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. An odd, sad smile
creases his face. He turns painfully on his side, away from Luke.

YODA
Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.

Luke watches him, each moment an eternity.

LUKE
Yoda, I must know.

YODA
Your father he is.

Luke reacts as if cut.

YODA
Told you, did he?

LUKE
Yes.

A new look of concern crosses Yoda's face.  He closes his eyes.

YODA
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...

LUKE
Unfortunate that I know the truth?

Yoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth.

YODA   (gathering all his strength)
No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your
training. Not
ready for the burden were you.

LUKE
Well, I'm sorry.

YODA
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger,
fear, aggression.
The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever
will it dominate your
destiny.

He beckons the young Jedi closer to him.

YODA
Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor,
or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I
(cough),
the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your
family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke...
(with great effort)
There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.

He catches his breath. A shiver runs through the ancient green
creature, and he dies. Luke stares at his dead master as he disappears
in front of his eyes.

51   EXT DAGOBAH SWAMP - X-WING

Luke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. Artoo beeps a greeting,
but is ignored by his depressed master. Luke kneels down, begins to
help Artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes his head dejectedly.

LUKE
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.

BEN  (OS)
Yoda will always be with you.

Luke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI.

LUKE
Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?

The ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp.

LUKE
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.

BEN
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be
Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your
father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a
certain point of view.

LUKE  (turning away, derisive)
A certain point of view!

BEN
Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend
greatly on our own
point of view.

Luke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment.

BEN
I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it
certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened
to your father was my fault.

Ben pauses sadly.

BEN
Anakin was a good friend.

Luke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a
stump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to offer his comforting presence.

BEN
When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was
amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to
train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well
as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the
galaxy.

Luke is entranced.

LUKE
There's still good in him.

BEN
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be
done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.

LUKE
I can't do it, Ben.

BEN
You cannot escape your destiny.

LUKE
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.

BEN
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience
was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value
of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you
could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been
prepared.

LUKE
But I had to help my friends.

BEN  (grinning at Luke's indignation)
And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved
little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.

LUKE  (with sadness)
I found out Darth Vader was my father.

BEN
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side
- the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest
door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what
he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're
no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now,
you must face Darth Vader again!

LUKE
I can't kill my own father.

BEN
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.

LUKE
Yoda spoke of another.

BEN
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.

LUKE
But I have no sister.

BEN
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your
father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were
to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the
reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.

LUKE
Leia! Leia's my sister.

BEN
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They
do you credit.
But they could be made to serve the Emperor.

Luke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this.

BEN  (continuing his narrative)
When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your
mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep
you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you
to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia
to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.

Luke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the tale.

BEN  (attempting to give solace with his words)
The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in
that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew
she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power,
since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family
continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster
father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of
course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the
corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a
vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she
was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had
always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became
desperate.

Luke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is suddenly protective of his
sister.

LUKE
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.

BEN
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have,
Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your
family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy
Vader!

52   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET

The vast Rebel Fleet stretches as far as the eye can see. Overhead a
dozen small Corellian battleships fly in formation. Fighters and
battlecruisers surround the largest of the Rebel Star Cruisers, the
HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE.

53   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM

Hundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled in
the WAR ROOM. WEDGE is among them. In the center of the room is a
holographic model depicting the half-completed Imperial Death Star, the
nearby Moon of Endor, and the protecting deflector shield.

MON MOTHMA, the leader of the Alliance, enters the room. She is a stern
but beautiful woman in her fifties. Conferring with her are several
military leaders, including GENERAL MADINE and ADMIRAL ACKBAR (a
salmon-colored Mon Calamari). Lando moves through the crowd until he
finds Han and Chewie, standing next to Leia and the two droids.

Han peers at Lando's new insignia on his chest, and is amused.

HAN
Well, look at you, a general, huh?

LANDO
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the
battle of Taanab.

HAN  (sarcastic)
Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I
didn't know they were
lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.

LANDO  (smiling)
I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.

HAN
Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable
one, remember?

Mon Mothma signals for attention, and the room falls silent.

MON MOTHMA
The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has
come.

This causes a stir. Mon Mothma turns to a holographic model of the
Death Star, the Endor moon and the protecting deflector shield in the
center of the room.

MON MOTHMA
The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location
of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon
systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial
Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is
relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that
the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the
construction of this Death Star.

A volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd. Han turns to Leia
as Chewie barks his amazement.

MON MOTHMA  (cont)
Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.

Admiral Ackbar steps forward and points to the Death Star's force field
and the Moon of Endor.

ACKBAR
You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor.
Although the weapon
systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does
have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield,
which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield
must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield
is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly
into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.

There's a concerned murmur.

ACKBAR  (cont)
General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack

Han turns to Lando with a look of respect.

HAN
Good luck.

Lando nods his thanks.

HAN
You're gonna need it.

ACKBAR
General Madine.

Madine moves center stage.

GENERAL MADINE
We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and
using a secret
Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the
shield generator.

The assembly begins to mumble among themselves.

THREEPIO
Sounds dangerous.

LEIA  (to Han)
I wonder who they found to pull that off.

GENERAL MADINE
General Solo, is your strike team assembled?

Leia, startled, looks up at Han, surprise changing to admiration.

HAN
Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.

Chewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers.  Han looks up at him.

HAN
Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.

Chewie waves that off with a huge GROWL.

HAN  (smiles)
That's one.

LEIA
Uh, General... count me in.

VOICE  (OS)
I'm with you, too!

They turn in that direction and peer into the crowd as there are more
cheers. The commanders part, and there at the back stands Luke. Han and
Leia are surprised and delighted.

Leia moves to Luke and embraces him warmly. She senses a change in him
and looks into his eyes questioningly.

LEIA
What is it?

LUKE  (hesitant)
Ask me again sometime.

Han, Chewie, and Lando crowd around Luke as the assembly breaks up.

HAN
Luke.

LUKE
Hi, Han... Chewie.

Artoo beeps a singsong observation to a worried Threepio.

THREEPIO
"Exciting" is hardly the word I would use.

54   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN DOCKING BAY

The Millennium Falcon rests beyond the stolen IMPERIAL SHUTTLE, which
looks anomalous among all the Rebel ships in the vast docking bay.
Chewie barks a final farewell to Lando and leads Artoo and Threepio up
the shuttle, crowded now with the Rebel strike team loading weapons and
supplies. Lando turns to face Han. Luke and Leia have said their good-
byes and start up the ramp.

HAN
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the
help you can get. She's
the fastest ship in the fleet.

LANDO
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take
good care of her.
She-she won't get a scratch. All right?

HAN  (looks at him warmly)
Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.

LANDO
Look, would you get going, you pirate.

Han and Lando pause, then exchange salutes.

LANDO
Good luck.

HAN
You, too.

Han goes up the ramp. Lando watches him go and then slowly turns away.

55   INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT

Luke is working on a back control panel as Han comes in and takes the
pilot's seat. Chewie, in the seat next to him, is trying to figure out
all the Imperial controls.

HAN
You got her warmed?

LUKE
Yeah, she's comin' up.

Chewie growls a complaint.

HAN
No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed
her, Chewie.

Leia comes in from the hold and takes her seat near Luke.

Chewie barks and hits some switches. Han's glance has stuck on
something out the window: the Millennium Falcon. Leia nudges him
gently.

LEIA
Hey, are you awake?

HAN
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.

Chewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks longingly out at the
Falcon, too. Leia puts a hand on Han's shoulder.

LEIA  (softly)
Come on, General, let's move.

Han snaps back to life.

HAN
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready,
everybody?

LUKE
All set.

THREEPIO
Here we go again.

HAN
All right, hang on.

56   EXT SPACE - THE REBEL FLEET

The stolen Imperial shuttle leaves the main docking bay of the
Headquarters Frigate, lowers its wings into flight position, and zooms
off into space.

57   INT EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM

The converted control room is dimly lit, except for a pool of light at
the far end. There the Emperor sits in an elaborate control chair
before a large window which looks out across the half-completed Death
Star to the giant green moon of Endor.

Darth Vader, standing with other members of the Imperial council,
cautiously approaches his master. The ruler's back is to Vader. After
several tense moments, the Emperor's chair rotates around to face him.

VADER
What is thy bidding, my Master?

EMPEROR
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until
called for.

VADER
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?

EMPEROR
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young
Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go
out to the command ship and await my orders.

VADER
Yes, my Master.

Vader bows, then turns and exits the throne room as the Emperor walks
toward the waiting council members.

58   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR - MOON

There is a great deal of Imperial traffic in the area as construction
proceeds on the Death Star. Transports, TIE fighters, and a few Star
Destroyers move about. Now the huge Super Star Destroyer announces
itself with a low roar and soon fills the frame.

59   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT

Han looks back at Luke and Leia as Chewie flips several switches.
Through the viewscreen, the Death Star and the huge Super Star
Destroyer can be seen.

HAN
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty
quick, Chewie.

Chewie growls his agreement.

CONTROLLER  (over radio)
We have you on our screen now. Please identify.

HAN
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.

CONTROLLER  (over radio)
Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.

HAN
Transmission commencing.

Leia and Chewbacca listen tensely as the sound of a high speed
transmission begins.

LEIA
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.

HAN
It'll work. It'll work.

Chewie whines nervously. Luke stares at the Huge Super Star Destroyer
that looms ever larger before them.

LUKE
Vader's on that ship.

HAN
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep
your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep
your distance.

Chewie barks a question.

HAN
I don't know.  Fly casual.

LUKE
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.

HAN
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.

Chewie barks his worries as the Super Star Destroyer grows larger out
the window.

60   INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Lord Vader stands, back to us, staring out a window at the Death Star.
Now, some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn. After a moment
of stillness, he walks down the row of controllers to where ADMIRAL
PIETT is leaning over the tracking screen of the controller we've seen
earlier. Piett straightens at Vader's approach.

VADER
Where is that shuttle going?

PIETT  (into comlink)
Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?

PILOT VOICE    (HAN)   (filtered)
Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.

The Bridge Commander looks to Vader for a reaction.

VADER
Do they have a code clearance?

PIETT
It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them.

Vader looks upward, as he senses Luke's presence.

PIETT
Shall I hold them?

VADER
No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.

PIETT  (surprised)
As you wish, my lord.
(to controller)
Carry on.

Piett nods at controller, who switches on his comlink.

61   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT

The group waits tensely.

HAN
They're not goin' for it, Chewie.

CONTROLLER  (filtered)
Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately.
Follow your
present course.

Everyone breaths a sigh of relief. Everyone but Luke, who looks
worried. Chewie barks.

HAN
Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.

62   EXT SPACE - STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - ENDOR

The stolen Imperial shuttle moves off toward the green Sanctuary Moon.

63   EXT FOREST LANDING SITE - ENDOR

The stolen Imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moon's dark,
primeval forest, dwarfed by the ancient towering trees.

On an adjacent hill, the helmeted Rebel contingent makes its way up a
steep trail. Leia and Han are slightly ahead of Chewie and Luke. The
troops of the strike-team squad follow, with Artoo and Threepio
bringing up the rear. Artoo beeps.

Up ahead, Chewie and Leia reach a crest in the hill and drop suddenly
to the ground, signaling the rest of the group to stop. Han and Luke
crawl up to take a look.

THREEPIO
Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.

THEIR POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering
through bushes in the valley below. Their two ROCKET BIKES are parked
nearby.

LEIA
Shall we try and go around?

HAN
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.

Leia motions for the squad to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and Chewie
start quietly down.

64   EXT FOREST CLEARING - CAMPSITE

The four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not far
from the two Imperial scouts.

HAN
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.

LUKE
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.

HAN  (grins)
Hey... it's me.

Han and Chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the scouts.
Luke and Leia exchange smiles.

Han sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the scout
whirls, knocking Han into a tree. The scout shouts for his companion.

SCOUT  1
Go for help! Go!

The second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off, but Chewie
gets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the scout to
crash into a tree. Han and Scout  1 are in a rousing fistfight.

LUKE  (sarcastic)
Great. Come on.

Luke starts for the scuffle, followed by Leia with her laser pistol
drawn. As they run through the bushes, Leia stops and points to where
two more scouts are sitting on their speeder bikes, with an unoccupied
bike parked nearby.

LEIA
Over there! Two more of them!

LUKE
I see them. Wait, Leia!

But Leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike. She
starts it up and takes off as Luke jumps on the bike behind her.

LUKE  (pointing to the controls)
Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!

Luke and Leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely
avoiding two huge trees.

HAN
Hey, wait! Ahhh!

He flips the remaining scout to the ground.

65   EXT FOREST - THE BIKE CHASE

The two fleeing Imperial scouts have a good lead as Luke and Leia
pursue through the giant trees at 200 miles an hour, the fire from
their bike's laser cannon hitting harmlessly near the moving targets.

LUKE
Move closer!

Leia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer
through a narrow gap in the trees. One of the bikes SCRAPES a tree,
slowing the scout.

LUKE
Get alongside that one!

Leia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that their
steering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to the back of
the scout's, grabs the Imperial warrior around the neck, and flips him
off the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke gains control of the bike
and follows Leia, who has pulled ahead. They tear off after the
remaining scout.

LUKE
Get him!

The speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two swing
into pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their laser
cannon. The two Rebels look behind them just as Luke's bike takes a
glancing hit.

LUKE  (indicating the one ahead)
Keep on that one! I'll take these two!

With Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into
the braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as
they zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into forward and
starts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a
manner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted
out of control. It explodes against a tree trunk.

The scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into
turbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.

FAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom
through the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and
rises out of sight.

The scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia
dives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes
a glancing hit.

Leia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches
down, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has
blasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike
explodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion.
But when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a
giant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a
conflagration.

ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout continue
their weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The
scout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a
bridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top
and crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a
wide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside
him makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all
his might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able
to make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the
scout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are
moving as one.

Another big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and
dives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's
explodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find
Luke.

Luke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and
opens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and
begins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it
appears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant,
Luke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty
slash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling,
it rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire.

66   EXT SCOUT CAMPSITE - FOREST

Han, Chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad, wait
anxiously in the clearing. Artoo's radar screen sticks out of his domed
head and revolves, scanning the forest. He beeps.

THREEPIO
Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!

Han, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.

Luke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. He's
too tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and looks around.

HAN
Luke! Where's Leia?

LUKE  (concerned)
What? She didn't come back?

HAN
I thought she was with you.

LUKE
We got separated.

Luke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets up wearily.

LUKE
Hey, we better go look for her.

Han nods, and signals to a Rebel officer.

HAN
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.

LUKE
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.

Luke, Chewie, Han, and the droids move off in one direction as the
squad proceeds in another.

THREEPIO
Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do.

They move off into the woods.

THREEPIO  (to Artoo)
And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!

67   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE

A strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly into
view. The creature is an EWOK, by the name of WICKET. He seems somewhat
puzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess groans; this
frightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again. Leia sits up
and stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She tries to figure out where
she is and what has happened. Her clothes are torn; she's bruised and
disheveled.

The Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he holds in a
defensive position. Leia watches him as he circles warily and begins
poking her with the sharp point of the spear.

LEIA
Cut it out!

She stands up, and the Ewok quickly backs away.

LEIA
I'm not gonna hurt you.

Leia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains of
her speeder bike, then sits down, with a sigh, on a fallen log.

LEIA
Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here
is.

She puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness from
her fall. She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and pats the log
beside her.

LEIA
Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.

Wicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy. Leia
pats the log again.

LEIA
I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.

More growls and squeaks from the little bear creature.

LEIA
All right. You want something to eat?

She takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him.
Wicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves cautiously
toward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok language.

LEIA
That's right. Come on. Hmmm?

Sniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits on the
log beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps
back, startled again. He runs along the log, pointing his spear at her
and chattering a blue streak. Leia holds out the helmet to him.

LEIA
Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery
little thing, aren't you?

Reassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log, coming
to investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to
sniff the air. He looks around warily, whispering some Ewokese warning
to Leia.

LEIA
What is it?

Suddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log
next to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the log, hiding
behind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while Wicket disappears
underneath the log. Another shot, and still no sight of anyone in the
forest. Then Leia senses something and turns to find a large IMPERIAL
SCOUT standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head. He reaches
out his hand for her weapon.

SCOUT  l
Freeze!  Come on, get up!

She hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the foliage
in front of the log.

SCOUT  1
Go get your ride and take her back to base.

SCOUT  2
Yes, sir.

The second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched under the
log, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the leg. The scout
jumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down at Wicket, puzzled.
Leia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his laser pistol,
and the second scout, now on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and
hits the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's
bike, which flies end over end and explodes. The forest is quiet once
more. Wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards
Leia with new respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking
around all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into the
dense foliage.

LEIA
Come on, let's get outta here.

As they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks and
tugs at Leia to follow him.

68   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO EMPEROR'S TOWER

Darth Vader walks down the corridor to the Emperor's Tower and private
elevator. The Emperor's private guard steps in Vader's path.

GUARD
Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.

VADER
(raising his gloved hand to the two guards and choking them with the
Force)
The Emperor will see me, now!

GUARD
(repeating Vader's command)
The Emperor will see you, now.

69   INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Two red Imperial Guards stand watch at the elevator as the door opens
to reveal Vader. Vader enters the eerie, foreboding throne room. It
appears to be empty. His footsteps echo as he approaches the throne. He
waits, absolutely still. The Emperor sits with his back to the Dark
Lord.

EMPEROR
I told you to remain on the command ship.

VADER
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.

EMPEROR  (no surprise)
Yes, I know.

VADER  (after a beat)
My son is with them.

EMPEROR  (very cool)
Are you sure?

VADER
I have felt him, my Master.

EMPEROR
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are
clear, Lord
Vader.

Vader knows what is being asked.

VADER
They are clear, my Master.

EMPEROR
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.

VADER  (skeptical)
He will come to me?

EMPEROR
I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will
come to you and
then you will bring him before me.

VADER  (bows)
As you wish.

The Dark Lord strides out of the throne room.

70   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE

Han, Luke, Chewie, and the two droids are spread out as they move
through the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw Leia.
Luke finds Leia's helmet, picks it up with an expression of concern.

HAN  (OS)
Luke! Luke!

Luke runs with the helmet to where Han has found the charred wreckage
of a speeder bike in the grass.

THREEPIO
Oh, Master Luke.

LUKE
There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.

He tosses the helmet to Han.

THREEPIO
I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.

HAN  (gravely)
I hope she's alright.

Chewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off
through the foliage.

HAN
What, Chewie? What? Chewie!

The others rush to keep up with the giant Wookiee. As he scoots along,
Artoo whistles nervously.

71   EXT FOREST - DENSE FOLIAGE

The group has reached a break in the undergrowth. Chewie walks up to a
tall stake planted in the ground. There is a dead animal hanging from
it.

HAN
Hey, I don't get it.

The rest of the group joins the Wookiee around the stake.

HAN  (cont)
Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.

Chewie can't resist. He reaches toward the meat.

LUKE
Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!

Too late. The Wookiee has already pulled the animal from the stake.
SPROOING! The group finds itself hanging upside down in an Ewok net,
suspended high above the clearing. Artoo lets out a wild series of
beeps and whistles, and Chewie howls his regret. Their bodies are a
jumble in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw from his mouth.

HAN
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.

LUKE
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this
thing.
(trying to free an arm)
Han, can you reach my lightsaber?

HAN
Yeah, sure.

Artoo is at the bottommost point in the net. He extends his cutting
appendage and begins slicing at the net. Han is trying to squeeze an
arm past Threepio to get at Luke's lightsaber. The net continues to
spin.

THREEPIO
Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-
op!!

Artoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the net,
crashing to the ground. As they regain their senses and sit up, they
realize they are surrounded by dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long
spear.

HAN
Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.

Han pushes the spear wielded by TEEBO out of his face and a second Ewok
warrior comes up to argue with Teebo. The spear returns to Han's face.
He grabs it angrily and starts to go for his laser pistol.

HAN
Hey!

LUKE
Han, don't. It'll be all right.

The Ewoks swarm through them and confiscate their weapons. Luke lets
them take his lightsaber. Chewie growls at the furry critters.

LUKE
Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.

Artoo and Threepio are just untangling themselves. Threepio gets free
of the net and sits up, rattled.

THREEPIO
Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!

When the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and chatter among
themselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue. The Ewok
nearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself before the droid. In
a moment, all the Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a puzzled
bark. Han and Luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder. The Ewoks
begin to chant at Threepio.

LUKE
Do you understand anything they're saying?

THREEPIO
Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million
forms of
communication.

HAN
What are you telling them?

THREEPIO
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive
dialect.  But
I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

Chewbacca and Artoo think that's very funny. Han and Luke exchange
"what next?" looks.

HAN
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?

THREEPIO
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.

HAN
Proper?!

THREEPIO
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.

Han moves toward Threepio threateningly.

HAN
Why, you--

Several Ewoks' spears are thrust in Han's face at the affront to their
god. The Ewoks move in to protect their god and Han is surrounded by a
menacing circle of spears, all aimed at him. He holds up his hands
placatingly.

HAN
My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.

72   EXT FOREST - SERIES OF SHOTS

A procession of Ewoks winds through the ever-darkening forest. Their
prisoners - Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo - are tied to long poles and
wrapped in vines, cocoonlike.

Each pole is carried on the shoulders of several Ewoks. Behind the
captives, Threepio is carried on a litter, like a king, by the
remaining creatures.

73   EXT FOREST WALKWAY - MOON FOREST

The procession moves along a shaky, narrow, wooden walkway, high in the
giant trees. It stops at the end of the walkway, which drops off into
nothingness. On the other side of the abyss is a village of mud huts
and rickety walkways, attached to the giant trees. The lead Ewok takes
hold of a long vine and swings across to the village square; the other
Ewoks follow suit.

74   EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE

The procession winds its way into the village square. Mother Ewoks
gather their babies up and scurry into their huts at the sight of the
newcomers. The group stops before the largest hut.

Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo are still bound to their poles. Han is
placed on a spit above what looks like a barbecue pit and the others
are leaned against a tree nearby. Threepio's litter throne is gently
placed near the pit. He watches with rapt fascination. Han, Luke, and
Chewie are less than fascinated.

HAN
I have a really bad feeling about this.

Chewie growls his concern.

Suddenly all activity stops as LOGRAY, the tribal Medicine Man, comes
out of the big hut. He examines the captives carefully, goes to join
Threepio, whose throne has been placed on an elevated platform. A
larger, gray-haired Ewok, CHIEF CHIRPA, is examining Luke's lightsaber
with great curiosity.

Logray speaks to Threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks, pointing
to the prisoners tied to the stakes. The Ewoks begin filling the pit
under Han with firewood.

HAN
What did he say?

THREEPIO
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the
main course at a
banquet in my honor.

The drums start beating, and all the furry heads turn to the large hut.
Leia emerges, wearing an animal-skin dress. She sees what's happening
at the same moment the prisoners see her.

HAN and LUKE
Leia!

As she moves toward them, the Ewoks block her way with raised spears.

LEIA
Oh!

THREEPIO
Your Royal Highness.

Artoo and Chewie chime in with their welcome. Leia looks at the
assembled Ewoks and sighs.

LEIA
But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free.

Threepio talks to Chirpa and Logray, who listen and shake their heads
negatively. The Medicine Man gestures toward the prisoners and barks
some orders. Several Ewoks jump up and pile more wood on the barbecue
with vigor. Leia trades frantic looks with Luke and Han .

HAN
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.

LUKE
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry
and use your magic.

THREEPIO
But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly --

LUKE
Just tell them.

Threepio speaks to the Ewoks. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray steps
forward and challenges Threepio. Luke closes his eyes and begins to
concentrate.

THREEPIO
You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...

Now the litter throne, with Threepio sitting upon it, rises from the
ground. At first Threepio doesn't notice and keeps talking.

THREEPIO
... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear!
Oh!

The Ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. Now Threepio
begins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool, with Threepio
calling out in total panic at his situation.

THREEPIO
Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help!
Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!

Chief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and
release the bound prisoners. Luke and Han enfold Leia in a group
embrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo beeping up at
him, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to the ground.
Logray orders the little droid cut down. Artoo crashes to the ground.
When the Ewoks set him upright, the little droid is fighting mad. Artoo
beeps a blue streak at the nearest Ewok, and begins pursuing him,
finally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. The
Ewok jumps two feet in the air and runs away, screaming. A small group
of Ewoks surround the giant Wookiee, scratching their heads and
marveling at his height.

THREEPIO
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.

LUKE
Thanks, Threepio.

THREEPIO  (still shaken)
I...I never knew I had it in me.

75   INT CHIEF'S HUT - COUNCIL OF ELDERS

A glowing fire dances in the center of the spartan, low-ceilinged room,
creating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. Along one side, a
group of ten Ewok elders flank Chief Chirpa, who sits on his throne.
The Rebels sit along the walls of the hut, with Threepio between the
two groups and Wicket and Teebo off to one side.

Threepio is in the midst of a long, animated speech in the Ewok's
squeaky native tongue. The Ewoks listen carefully and occasionally
murmur comments to each other. Threepio points several times at the
Rebel group and pantomimes a short history of the Galactic Civil War,
mimicking the explosion and rocket sounds, imitating Imperial walkers.
Throughout the long account, certain familiar names are distinguishable
in English: Princess Leia, Artoo, Darth Vader, Death Star, Jedi, Obi-
Wan Kenobi. Artoo begins beeping excitedly at Threepio.

THREEPIO
Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.

Threepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader, Han
Solo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the present time.

At the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then nod in
agreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement.

The drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great cheer
and screeches.

HAN
What's going on?

LEIA
I don't know.

Luke has been sharing the joy with smiling visage, but now something
passes like a dark cloud through his consciousness. The others do not
notice.

THREEPIO
Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.

Several of the little teddy bears run up and hug the Rebels.

HAN
Just what I always wanted.

Chewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an Ewok, while Wicket
clings to Han's leg.

HAN  (chuckles)
Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie.
(to Wicket)
Thank you. Okay.

THREEPIO
He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield
generator.

Chewie barks. Luke has drifted to the back of the hut. Now he wanders
outside into the moonlight. Leia notices and follows.

HAN
Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try
and get our weapons back.

Han pulls Threepio back as he keeps trying to translate.

HAN  (cont)
And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.

76   EXT EWOK VILLAGE - NIGHT

The walkway is deserted now. The windows of the little huts glow and
flicker from the fires inside. The sounds of the forest fill the soft
night air. Luke has wandered away from the Chief's hut and stands
staring up at the Death Star. Leia finds him like that.

LEIA
Luke, what's wrong?

Luke turns and looks at her a long moment.

LUKE
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?

LEIA
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.

LUKE
What do you remember?

LEIA
Just...images, really. Feelings.

LUKE
Tell me.

LEIA
(a little surprised at his insistence)
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.
(looks up)
Why are you asking me all this?

He looks away.

LUKE
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.

LEIA
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?

LUKE
Vader is here...now, on this moon.

LEIA  (alarmed)
How do you know?

LUKE
I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near.
That's why I have to go.
(facing her)
As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.
(beat)
I have to face him.

Leia is distraught, confused.

LEIA
Why?

Luke moves close and his manner is gentle. And very calm.

LUKE
He's my father.

LEIA
Your father?

LUKE
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I
don't make it back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.

Leia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it.

LEIA
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and
could never have.

LUKE
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to
use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has
it...I have it...and...my sister has it.

Leia stares into his eyes. What she sees there frightens her. But she
doesn't draw away. She begins to understand.

LUKE
Yes. It's you Leia.

LEIA
I know. Somehow...I've always known.

LUKE
Then you know why I have to face him.

LEIA
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave
this place. I wish I could go with you.

LUKE
No, you don't. You've always been strong.

LEIA
But, why must you confront him?

LUKE
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to
the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I
have to try.

They hold each other close and look at each other, brother and sister.

Leia holds back her tears as Luke slowly lets her go and moves away. He
disappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village. Leia, bathed
in moonlight, watches him go as Han comes out of the Chief's hut and
comes over to her. Leia is crying, her body trembling. He realizes only
now that she is crying.

HAN
Hey, what's goin' on?

Leia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes.

LEIA
Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.

HAN  (angry)
Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?

She looks up at him, struggling to control herself.

LEIA
I...I can't tell you.

HAN  (loses his temper)
Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?

LEIA
I...

HAN
Ahhh...

He starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to her.

HAN
I'm sorry.

LEIA
Hold me.

Han gathers her tightly in his protective embrace.

77   EXT FOREST - IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM

An Imperial shuttle floats down from the Death Star and lands
gracefully on the huge platform.

Now, an Imperial walker approaches the platform from the darkness of
the forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military - looks
particularly offensive in the midst of this verdant beauty.

78   EXT IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM - LOWER DECK

Darth Vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the platform, into
an elevator, and appears on a ramp on a lower level. He walks toward
another ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a commander with Luke,
in binders, at their center. The young Jedi gazes at Vader with
complete calm.

COMMANDER
This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I
believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct
a further search of the area.

The commander extends his hand, revealing Luke's lightsaber.

COMMANDER
He was armed only with this.

Vader looks at Luke, turns away and faces the commander, taking the
lightsaber from the commander's hand.

VADER
Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his
companions to me.

COMMANDER
Yes, my Lord.

The officer and troops withdraw. Vader and Luke are left standing alone
in the oddly tranquil beauty of the place. The sounds of the forest
filter in upon them.

VADER
The Emperor has been expecting you.

LUKE
I know, father.

VADER
So, you have accepted the truth.

LURE
I've accepted the truth that you were once Anakin Skywalker, my father.

VADER  (turning to face him)
That name no longer has any meaning for me.

LUKE
It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there
is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is
why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your
Emperor now.

Vader looks down from Luke to the lightsaber in his own black- gloved
hand. He seems to ponder Luke's words.

VADER  (indicating lightsaber)
I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.

Vader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming,
brilliant blade.

VADER
Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has
foreseen.

They stand for a moment, the Vader extinguishes the lightsaber.

LUKE
Come with me.

VADER
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

Luke steps close to Vader, then stops. Vader is still.

VADER
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.

LUKE
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.

VADER
If that is your destiny.

LUKE
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict
within you. Let go
of your hate.

VADER
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature
of the Force. He is
your master now.

Vader signals to some distant stormtroopers. He and Luke stand staring
at one another for a long moment.

LUKE
Then my father is truly dead.

79   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING SHIELD GENERATOR

Han, Leia, Chewbacca, the droids, Wicket, and another Ewok scout,
PAPLOO, hide on a ridge overlooking the massive Imperial shield
generator. At the base of the generator is an Imperial landing
platform. Leia studies the installation.

LEIA
The main entrance to the control bunker's on the far side of that
landing platform. This
isn't gonna be easy.

HAN
Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily
guarded than this.

Wicket and Paploo are chattering away in Ewok language. They speak to
Threepio.

LEIA
What's he saying?

THREEPIO
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.

80   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET

The vast fleet hangs in space near a blue planet. A giant Rebel Star
Cruiser is up at the front, but now the Millennium Flacon roars up to a
spot ahead of it, tiny in comparison.

81   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando is in the pilot seat. His alien copilot, NIEN NUNB, takes some
getting used to in the familiar environs of the Falcon's cockpit. Lando
speaks into his comlink.

LANDO
Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for.

ACKBAR  (VO)
Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates.

Lando turns to his weird copilot.

LANDO
Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down
on time...
(to himself)
or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time.

The copilot flips some switches and grunts an alien comment.

ACKBAR  (VO)
All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark.

LANDO
All right. Stand by.

He pulls a lever, and the stars outside begin to streak.

82   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET

We are treated to an awesome sight: first the Millennium Falcon, then
Ackbar's Star Cruiser, then, in large segments, the huge fleet ROARS
INTO HYPERSPACE. And disappears.

83   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING CONTROL BUNKER

Han, Leia, Chewie, the droids, and their two Ewok guides, Wicket and
Paploo, have reunited with the Rebel strike squad. The entire group is
spread through the thick undergrowth. Below them is the BUNKER that
leads into the generator. Four Imperial scouts, their speeder bikes
parked nearby, keep watch over the bunker entrance. Chewie growls an
observation, and Paploo chatters away to Han in Ewok language.

HAN
Back door, huh? Good idea.

Wicket and Paploo continue their Ewok conversation.

HAN  (cont)
It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble.

LEIA
Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm.

HAN  (with self-confident grin)
Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

Threepio explains what is going on to Wicket and Paploo. The Ewoks
chatter a moment between themselves. Then Paploo jumps up and scampers
into the underbrush.

Threepio asks Wicket where Paploo went and is given a short reply.

THREEPIO
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!

LEIA
Quiet.

THREEPIO
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.

LEIA
Oh, no.

84   EXT BUNKER - ENTRANCE

Paploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the Imperial
scouts are lounging. He silently swings his furry ball of a body onto
one of the scout's speeder bikes and begins flipping switches at
random. Suddenly, the bike's engine fires up with a tremendous ROAR.
Paploo grins and continues flipping switches. The scouts leap up in
surprise.

85   EXT RIDGE

Han, Leia and company watch in distress. Chewie barks.

HAN  (sighs)
There goes our surprise attack.

86   EXT BUNKER

The Imperial scouts race toward Paploo just as his speeder zooms into
motion. Paploo hangs on by his paws and shoots away into the forest.

SCOUT
Look! Over there! Stop him!

Three of the Imperial scouts jump on their rocket bikes and speed away
in pursuit. The fourth watches them go from his post at the door.

87   EXT RIDGE

Han, Leia, and Chewie exchange delighted looks.

HAN
Not bad for a little furball. There's only one left. You stay here.
We'll take care of this.

Han and the Wookiee nod at each other and slip down toward the bunker.
Threepio moves to stand next to Wicket and Artoo.

THREEPIO
I have decided that we shall stay here.

88   EXT FOREST

Paploo sails through the trees, more lucky than in control. It's scary,
but he loves it. When the Imperial scouts pull within sight behind him
and begin firing laser bolts, he decides he's had enough. As he rounds
a tree, out of their sight, Paploo grabs a vine and swings up into the
trees. A moment later, the scouts tear under him in pursuit of the
still-flying, unoccupied bike.

89   EXT BUNKER

Han sneaks up behind the remaining Imperial scout, taps him on the
shoulder and lets the scout chase him behind the bunker into the arms
of the waiting Rebel strike team. Han returns to the front, and taps
out a pattern on the bunker door's control panel. Everyone stands out
of sight, police-style, as the door opens. Han and Leia peek inside. No
sign of life. The group enters the bunker silently, leaving one lookout
behind.

90   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM

The elevator opens. Vader and Luke enter the room alone. They walk
across the dark space to stand before the throne, father and son side
by side beneath the gaze of the Emperor. Vader bows to his Master.

EMPEROR
Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you.

Luke peers at the hooded figure defiantly. The Emperor then looks down
at Luke's binders.

EMPEROR
You no longer need those.

The Emperor motions ever so slightly with his finger and Luke's binders
fall away, clattering to the floor. Luke looks down at his own hands,
free now to reach out and grab the Emperor's neck. He does nothing.

EMPEROR
Guards, leave us.

The red-cloaked guards turn and disappear behind the elevator.

EMPEROR  (to Luke)
I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call
me Master.

LUKE
You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me as you did my father.

The Emperor gets down from his throne and walks up very close to Luke.
The Emperor looks into his eyes and, for the first time, Luke can
perceive the evil visage within the hood.

EMPEROR
Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it is you who are
mistaken...about a great many things.

VADER
His lightsaber.

Vader extends a gloved hand toward the Emperor, revealing Luke's
lightsaber. The Emperor takes it.

EMPEROR
Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know
your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with
you.

LUKE
You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.

The Emperor laughs.

EMPEROR
Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.

Luke looks up sharply.

EMPEROR
Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.

Vader looks at Luke.

LUKE
Your overconfidence is your weakness.

EMPEROR
Your faith in your friends is yours.

VADER
It is pointless to resist, my son.

The Emperor turns to face Luke.

EMPEROR  (angry)
Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design.
(indicates Endor)
Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon...

Luke reacts. The Emperor notes it.

EMPEROR  (cont)
...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who
allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It
is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my
best troops awaits them.

Luke's look darts from the Emperor to Vader and, finally, to the sword
in the Emperor's hand.

EMPEROR
Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when
your friends arrive.

91   INT BUNKER - MAIN CONTROL ROOM

Han, Leia, Chewie, and the Rebel strike team storm through a door and
enter the main control room, taking all of the personnel prisoner.

HAN
All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie.

The Rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from their panels.
Leia glances at one of the screens on the control panel.

LEIA
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.

HAN
Charges!  Come on, come on!

Outside, Threepio watches nervously in the bushes as several more
controllers and stormtroopers run into the bunker, leaving guards at
the door.

THREEPIO  (to Wicket)
Oh, my! They'll be captured!

Wicket chatters in Ewok language, and then takes off full steam into
the forest.

THREEPIO
Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.

Inside the bunker, Han looks up from setting charges as an Imperial
commander enters.

COMMANDER
Freeze! You Rebel scum.

Han and Leia spin, to find dozens of Imperial weapons trained on them
and their cohorts. A poised force of Imperial troops surround them.
Even more pour into the room, roughly disarming the Rebel contingent.
Han, Leia, and Chewie exchange looks. They're helpless.

92   EXT SPACE - ENDOR, DEATH STAR, REBEL FLEET

The Death Star and its Sanctuary Moon hang distant in space as the
Rebel fleet comes out of hyperspace with an awesome roar. The
Millennium Falcon and several Rebel fighters are at the front as the
space armada bears down on its target.

93   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando flips switches, checks his screen, and speaks into the radio.

LANDO
All wings report in.

WEDGE
Red Leader standing by.

GRAY LEADER
Gray Leader standing by.

GREEN LEADER
Green Leader standing by.

WEDGE
Lock S-foils in attack positions.

94   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

From the bridge of the Rebel Headquarters Frigate, Admiral Ackbar
watches the fighters massing outside his viewscreen.

ACKBAR
May the Force be with us.

95   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando looks worriedly at his alien copilot, Nien Nunb, who points to
the control panel and talks to Lando.

LANDO
We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up
or down. Well, how
could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming.

Lando shoots a concerned look out at the approaching Death Star as the
implications of what he's just said sink in. He hits a switch on his
comlink.

LANDO
Break off the attack! The shield is still up.

RED LEADER  (VO)
I get no reading. Are you sure?

LANDO
Pull up! All craft pull up!

The Falcon turns hard to the left. Out the window the stars and the
Death Star move off right.

96   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR SHIELD

The Falcon and the fighters of Red Squad veer off desperately to avoid
the unseen wall.

97   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

Alarms are screaming and lights flashing as the huge ship changes
course abruptly. Other ships in the fleet shoot by outside as the
armada tries to halt its forward momentum.

ACKBAR
Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close to holding sector MV-7.

A Mon Calamari controller turns away from his screen and calls out to
Ackbar, quite excited. The Admiral rushes over to the controller.

CONTROLLER
Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.

On the screen can be seen the moon, Death Star, and the massive
Imperial fleet. Ackbar moves to the comlink.

ACKBAR
It's a trap!

LANDO  (over comlink)
Fighters coming in.

There is much excitement on the bridge as the attack begins.

The Millennium Falcon and several squads of Rebel fighters head into an
armada of TIE fighters. The sky explodes as a fierce dogfight ensues in
and around the giant Rebel cruisers.

REBEL PILOT
There's too many of them!

LANDO
Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire away from the cruisers.

WEDGE
Copy, Gold Leader.

The battle continues around the giant cruisers.

98   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM

Through the round window behind the Emperor's throne can be seen the
distant flashes of the space battle in progress.

EMPEROR
Come, boy. See for yourself.

The Emperor is sitting in his throne, with Vader standing at his side.
Luke moves to look through a small section of the window.

EMPEROR
From here you will witness the final destruction of the Alliance, and
the end of your insignificant Rebellion.

Luke is in torment. He glances at his lightsaber sitting on the armrest
of the throne. The Emperor watches him and smiles, touches the
lightsaber.

EMPEROR
You want this, don't you? The hate is swelling in you now. Take your
Jedi weapon. Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it. Give in to
your anger. With each passing moment, you make yourself more my
servant.

Vader watches Luke in his agony.

LUKE
No!

EMPEROR
It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You, like your father, are now
mine!

99   EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

Han, Leia, Chewie, and the rest of the strike team are led out of the
bunker by their captors. The surrounding area, deserted before, is now
crowded with two-legged Imperial walkers and hundreds of Imperial
troops. The situation looks hopeless.

STORMTROOPER
All right, move it! I said move it! Go on!

From the undergrowth beyond the clearing comes a wild series of beeps
and whistles.
And --

THREEPIO
Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?

BUNKER COMMANDER
Bring those two down here!

STORMTROOPER
Let's go!

Artoo and Threepio are standing near one of the big trees. As six
Imperial stormtroopers rush over to take them captive, the two droids
duck out of sight behind the tree.

THREEPIO
Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?

STORMTROOPER
Freeze! Don't move!

THREEPIO
We surrender.

The stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids waiting
quietly to be taken. As the Imperial troops move to do that, however, a
band of Ewoks drops down from above and overpowers them.

THREEPIO
Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.

In a nearby tree, an Ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds the EWOK
ATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Ewoks throw their
fuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled stormtroopers and
their awesome two-legged walkers. Biker scouts dart about blasting
Ewoks, only to be crushed by a volley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the
trees above.

In the confusion of the battle, Han and Leia break away and dive for
the cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them. Han goes
to the bunker door control panel.

LEIA
The code's changed. We need Artoo!

HAN
Here's the terminal.

LEIA  (into comlink)
Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away.

Artoo and Threepio are hiding behind a log as the battle ragesaround
them. Suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a series of
whistles and shoots off across the battlefield. Threepio, panicked,
runs after him.

THREEPIO
Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo?
No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!

Biker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away at the
little Ewoks as the furries scurry for cover.

A group of Ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position. They
fire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers. The walker turns
and heads for the catapult, blasting away with both guns. The Ewoks
abandon their weapons and flee in all directions. Just as the walker
moves in to stomp the catapult, Ewoks drop vines restraining two huge
logs that swing down and smash thewalker's head flat.

A line of Ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a walker's
foot. As the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are dragged
behind.

Two speeder bikes chase Ewoks through the underbrush. As the scouts
round a tree, they are knocked off their bikes by a vinetied between
two trees.

100  EXT SPACE

The Falcon and other Rebel fighters are engaged in a ferocious combat
with Imperial TIE fighters, the battle raging around thecruisers of the
Rebel armada.

101  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT
Lando is in radio communication with the pilots of the other Rebel
squads.

LANDO
Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!

WEDGE
Red Three, Red Two, pull in!

RED TWO
Got it!

RED THREE
Three of them coming in, twenty degrees!

WEDGE
Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical
frigate.

Lando steers the Falcon through a complete flip, as his crew fires at
the TIEs from the belly guns.

NAVIGATOR
Pressure's steady.

The copilot Nien Nunb chatters an observation.

LANDO
Only the fighters are attacking.  I wonder what those Star Destroyers
are waiting for.

102  EXT SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET

The giant Imperial Star Destroyer waits silently some distance from the
battle. The Emperor's huge Super Star Destroyer rests in the middle of
the fleet.

103  INT SUPER STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Admiral Piett and two fleet commanders watch the battle at the huge
window of the Super Star Destroyer bridge.

COMMANDER
We're in attack position now, sir.

PIETT
Hold here.

COMMANDER
We're not going to attack?

PIETT
I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He has something special
planned for them. We only need to keep them from escaping.

104  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

The Emperor, Vader, and a horrified Luke watch the aerial battle
fireworks out the window and on the viewscreens. Another Rebel ship
explodes against the protective shield.

EMPEROR
As you can see, my young apprentice, your friends have failed. Now
witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle
station.
(into comlink)
Fire at will, Commander.

Luke, in shock, looks out across the surface of the Death Star to the
Rebel fleet beyond.

105  INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM

Controllers pull back on several switches. Commander Jerjerrod stands
over them.

JERJERROD
Fire!

106  INT DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER

A button is pressed, which switches on a panel of lights. A hooded
Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. A huge beam of
light emanates from a long shaft. Two stormtroopers stand to one side
at a control panel.

107  EXT DEATH STAR

The giant laser dish on the completed half of the Death Star begins to
glow; Then a powerful beams shoots out toward the aerial battle.

108  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE

The air is thick with giant ships. In among them, Rebel X-wings
dogfight with Imperial TIE fighters. Now an enormous Rebel cruiser is
hit by the Death Star beam and is blown to dust.

The Millennium Falcon roars over CAMERA, followed closely byseveral TIE
fighters.

109  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

The ship is buffeted by the tremendous explosion of the Rebel cruiser.
Lando and his copilot are stunned by the sight of the Death Star
firepower.

LANDO
That blast came from the Death Star! That thing's operational!
(into comlink)
Home One, this is Gold Leader.

110  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

Ackbar stands amid the confusion on the wide bridge and speaks into the
comlink.

ACKBAR
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.

LANDO
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.

ACKBAR
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel
firepower of that magnitude.

LANDO
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.

111  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

Artoo and Threepio make it to the door, as Han and Leia provide cover
fire.

THREEPIO
We're coming!

HAN
Come on! Come on!

THREEPIO
Oh, Artoo, hurry!

The little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer arm. A
large explosion hits near Artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally
landing on his feet. The stubby astrodroid's head is spinning and
smoldering. Suddenly there is a loud SPROOING and Han and Leia turn
around to see Artoo with all his compartment doors open, and all of his
appendages sticking out; water and smoke spurt out of the nozzles in
his body. Han rushes to the terminal, as Threepio rushes to his wounded
companion.

THREEPIO
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?

HAN
Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.

LEIA
I'll cover you.

Ewoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the
stormtroopers, divebombing their deadly adversaries.  One is hit in the
wing with laser fire and crashes. A walker lumbers forward, shooting
laser blasts at frantic Ewoks running in all directions.  Two Ewoks are
struck down by laser blasts.  One tries to awaken his friend, then
realizes that he is dead.

112  EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR

The Rebel fleet continues to be picked off, from one side by the Death
Star's deadly beam, from the other by the rampaging Imperial Star
Destroyers.

113  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando steers the Falcon wildly through an obstacle course of floating
giants. He's been yelling into the comlink.

LANDO  (desperately)
Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star
Destroyers at point-
blank range.

ACKBAR
At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers.

LANDO
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might
just take a few of
them with us.

The Rebel cruisers move very close to the Imperial Star Destroyers and
begin to blast away at point-blank range. Tiny fighters race across the
giant surfaces, against a backdrop of laser fire.

The control tower of a Star Destroyer is under attack.

REBEL PILOT
She's gonna blow!

Y-WING PILOT
I'm hit!

The damaged Y-wing plummets toward the Star Destroyer, and crashes into
the control tower, exploding.

114  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Out of the window and on the view screens, the Rebel fleet is being
decimated in blinding explosions of light and debris. But in here there
is no sound of battle. The Emperor turns to Luke.

EMPEROR
Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not
survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will
die...as will your friends.

Luke's eyes are full of rage. Vader watches him.

EMPEROR
Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon!
Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark
side will be complete.

Luke can resist no longer. The lightsaber flies into his hand. He
ignites it in an instant and swings at the Emperor. Vader's lightsaber
flashes into view, blocking Luke's blow before it can reach the
Emperor. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to fight his
father.

115  EXT FOREST

The battle rages on. Stormtroopers fire on Ewoks with sophisticated
weapons while their furry little adversaries sneak up behind the
Imperial troopers and bash them over the head with large clubs.

A walker marches through the undergrowth blasting Ewoks as it goes. An
Ewok warrior gives the signal, and a pile of logs is cut loose. The
logs tumble under the walker's feet, causing it to slip and slide until
it finally topples over with a great crash.

A scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine. The other end
of the vine is tied to a tree, and the bike swings around in ever-
tightening circles until it runs out of rope and
crashes into the trees with a huge explosion.

Chewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers. Two Ewoks
cling to him. They land with a thud on the top of the lurching machine,
then hang on for dear life. One of the Ewoks peeks through the window.

WALKER PILOT  1
Look!

PILOT  2
Get him off of there!

The walker pilot opens the hatch to see what's going on. He is yanked
out and tossed overboard before he can scream. The two Ewoks jump into
the cockpit and knock the second pilot unconscious. The Ewoks are
thrown violently as the mighty machine careens out of control. Outside,
Chewie is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head into the hatch
with a series of angry barks. The Ewoks are too busy and frightened to
listen to the Wookiee's complaint. Chewie slips inside the walker.

Chewbacca's walker moves through the forest, firing laser blasts at
unsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other Imperial walkers. The
Ewoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps turn the tide of the
battle in their favor.

116  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

Han works furiously at the control panel; wires spark as he attempts to
hotwire the door. He motions to Leia, who is blasting away at some
stormtroopers.

HAN
I think I got it. I got it!

The three wires spark as the connection is made. With a LOUD WHOOSH, a
second blast door crashes down in front of the first.

Han frowns and turns back to the wires again. Leia exchanges shots with
stormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out in pain, her
shoulder hit by a laser blast.

THREEPIO
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?

HAN
Let's see.

LEIA
It's not bad.

STORMTROOPER  (OS)
Freeze!

They freeze.

THREEPIO
Oh, dear.

STORMTROOPER
Don't move!

Leia holds her laser gun ready, behind Han, out of view of the two
stormtroopers moving toward them. Han and Leia's eyes lock; the moment
seems suspended in time.

HAN
I love you.

Another shared look between them, as she smiles up at Han.

LEIA
I know.

STORMTROOPER
Hands up! Stand up!

Han stands up slowly and turns, revealing the gun in Leia's hand. She
disposes of the stormtroopers in a flash. As Han turns back toward
Leia, he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand before him,
its deadly weapons aimed right at him.

HAN  (to Leia)
Stay back.

The hatch on top of the walker opens and Chewie sticks his head out and
barks triumphantly.

HAN
Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea.

117  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Luke and Vader are engaged in a man-to-man duel of lightsabers even
more vicious then the battle on Bespin. But the young Jedi has grown
stronger in the interim, and now the advantage shifts to him. Vader is
forced back, losing his balance, and is knocked down the stairs. Luke
stands at the top of the stairs, ready to attack.

EMPEROR (laughing)
Good.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through
you.

Luke looks momentarily toward the Emperor, then back to Vader, and
realizes he is using the dark side. He steps back, turns off his
lightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his being.

VADER
Obi-Wan has taught you well.

LUKE
I will not fight you, father.

Vader walks back up the stairs to Luke.

VADER
You are unwise to lower your defenses.

Vader attacks, forcing Luke on the defensive. The young Jedi leaps in
an amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk overhead. Vader
stands below him.

LUKE
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the
conflict.

VADER
There is no conflict.

LUKE
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe
you'll destroy me
now.

VADER
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight,
then you will meet
your destiny.

Vader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports holding
the catwalk, then returns to Vader's hand. Luke tumbles to the ground
in a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under the Emperor's
platform. Vader moves to find him.

EMPEROR  (laughs)
Good.  Good.

118  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE

The two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at each
other in individual point-blank confrontations. A Star Destroyer
explodes. The Rebel victor limps away, its back half alive with a
series of minor explosions. The Rebel cruiser manages to move in next
to a second Star Destroyer before it explodes completely, taking the
Imperial Star Destroyer with it. The Falcon and several fighters attack
one of the larger Imperial ships.

LANDO
Watch out. Squad at .06.

REBEL PILOT
I'm on it, Gold Leader.

WEDGE
Good shot, Red Two.

LANDO
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.

119  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM

Controllers watch the main viewscreen on which a vague figure of an
Imperial walker pilot can be seen. There is a great deal of static and
interference.

HAN PILOT  (VO)
It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into
the woods. We
need reinforcements to continue the pursuit.

The controllers cheer.

CONTROL ROOM COMMANDER
Send three squads to help. Open the back door.

SECOND COMMANDER
Yes, sir.

120  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

As the door to the bunker opens and the Imperial troops rush out,
they're surprised to find themselves surrounded by Rebels, their
weapons pointed at them. Ewoks holding bows and arrows appear on the
roof of the bunker. The Imperial troops throw down their guns
as Han and Chewie rush inside the bunker with explosive charges.

121  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM

Han, Chewie, and several troops rush into the control room and plant
explosive charges on the control panels and rush out.

HAN
Throw me another charge.

122  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Vader stalks the low-ceilinged area on the level below the throne,
searching for Luke in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber held ready.

VADER
You cannot hide forever, Luke.

LUKE
I will not fight you.

VADER
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your
friends. Yes, your
thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially
for...

Vader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes tightly, in
anguish.

VADER
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed
her, too. Obi-Wan
was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will
not turn to the dark
side, then perhaps she will.

LUKE
Never-r-r!

Luke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at hisfather
with a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke and Vader
fight in the cramped area. Luke's hatred forces Vader to retreat out of
the low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft.
Each stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat.

The Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword to
block another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off at the
wrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the mechanical
stump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over the
edge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke moves
over Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark Lord's throat.
The Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased agitation.

EMPEROR
Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and
take your father's
place at my side!

Luke looks at his father's mechanical hand, then to his own mechanical,
black-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is becoming like his
father. He makes the decision for which he has spent a lifetime in
preparation. Luke steps back and hurls his lightsaber away.

LUKE
Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness.
I am a Jedi,
like my father before me.

The Emperor's glee turns to rage.

EMPEROR
So be it...Jedi.

123  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER

Han and several of the fighters run out of the bunker and race across
the clearing.

HAN
Move! Move!

A shock wave knocks them flat as the bunker explodes, followed by a
spectacular display as the huge shield-generator radar dish explodes
along with the bunker.

124  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

Ackbar, sitting in his control chair, speaks into the radio.

ACKBAR
The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor.

LANDO
We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me.
(laughs)
Told you they'd do it!

The Falcon, followed by several smaller Rebel fighters, heads toward
the unfinished superstructure of the Death Star.

125  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM

Luke stands still, as the Emperor reaches the bottom of thestairs. The
Emperor's laughter has turned to anger. He raises his arms toward Luke.

EMPEROR
If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed.

Blinding bolts of energy, evil lightning, shoot from the Emperor's
hands at Luke. Even in his surprise, the young Jedi tries to use the
Force to deflect them. At first he is half successful, but after a
moment the bolts of energy are coming with such speed and power the
young Jedi shrinks before them, his knees buckling. The wounded Vader
struggles to his feet, and moves to stand at his master's side.

EMPEROR
Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand.

Luke is almost unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the
Emperor's lightning. He clutches a canister to keep from falling into
the bottomless shaft as the bolts tear through him.

EMPEROR
Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You
have paid the price for
your lack of vision.

Luke writhes on the floor in unbearable pain, reaching weakly up toward
where Vader stands watching.

LUKE  (groans)
Father, please. Help me.

Again Vader stands, watching Luke. He looks at his master, the Emperor,
then back to Luke on the floor.

EMPEROR
Now, young Skywalker...you will die.

Although it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts
from the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity, the sound
screaming through the room. Luke's body writhes in pain.

Vader grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the robed
figure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely weakened arm.
The Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-shooting hands now
lifted high, away from Luke. Now the white lightning arcs back to
strike at Vader. He stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his
helmet and flow down over his black cape. He holds his evil master high
over his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of
the throne room. With one final burst of his once awesome strength,
Darth Vader hurls the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft.

The Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it falls
into the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the shaft, it
explodes, creating a rush of air through the room.Vader's cape is
whipped by the wind and he staggers, and collapses toward the
bottomless hole. Luke crawls to his father's side and pulls him away
from the edge of the abyss to safety. Both the young Jedi and the giant
warrior are too weak to move.

126  EXT INT - SPACE BATTLE - FIGHTER AND DEATH STAR

Rebel fighters follow the Falcon across the surface of the Death Star
to the unfinished portion, where they dive into the superstructure of
the giant battle station, followed by many TIE fighters.

WEDGE
I'm going in.

LANDO
Here goes nothing.

Three X-wings lead the chase through the ever-narrowing shaft, followed
by the Falcon and four other fighters, plus TIE fighters who
continually fire at the Rebels. Lights reflect off the pilot's faces as
they race through the dark shaft.

LANDO
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power
generator.

WEDGE
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.

The fighters and the Falcon race through the tunnel, still pursued by
the TIE fighters. One of the X-wings is hit from behind and explodes.

LANDO
Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of
those TIE fighters to
follow you.

PILOT
Copy, Gold Leader.

The Rebel ships peel off pursued by three of the TIE's, while Lando and
Wedge continue through the main tunnel. It narrows, and the Falcon
scrapes the side dangerously. Two other TIE fighters continue to blast
away at them.

LANDO
That was too close.

Nien Nunb agrees. The battle between the Rebel and Imperial fleet rages
on. Several cruisers fire at the giant Super Star Destroyer.

127  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

ACKBAR
We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on
that Super Star Destroyer.

X-wings pilots head across the surface of the huge battleship.

128  INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE

Admiral Piett and a commander stand at the window, looking out to the
battle. They look concerned.

CONTROLLER
Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield.

PIETT
Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through.

The commander is looking out of the window where a damaged Rebel
fighter is out of control and heading directly toward the bridge.

PIETT
Intensify forward firepower!

COMMANDER
It's too late!

The Rebel pilot screams as his ship hits the Star Destroyer, causing a
huge explosion. The giant battle ship loses control, crashes into the
Death Star, and explodes.

129  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

There is excitement on the bridge as the battle rages on all sides.
They cheer as the giant Star Destroyer blows up.

130  INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY

Chaos. For the first time, the Death Star is rocked by explosions as
the Rebel fleet, no longer backed against a wall, zooms over, unloading
a heavy barrage. Imperial troops run in all directions, confused and
desperate to escape.

In the midst of this uproar, Luke is trying to carry the enormous
deadweight of his father's weakening body toward an Imperial shuttle.
Finally, Luke collapses from the strain. The explosions grow louder as
Vader draws him closer.

VADER  (a whisper)
Luke, help me take this mask off.

LURE
But you'll die.

VADER
Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my
own eyes.

Slowly, hesitantly, Luke removes the mask from his father's face. There
beneath the scars is an elderly man. His eyes do not focus. But the
dying man smiles at the sight before him.

ANAKIN  (very weak)
Now...go, my son. Leave me.

LUKE
No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save
you.

ANAKIN
You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you
were right.

LUKE
Father...I won't leave you.

Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker...Luke's father, dies.

A huge explosion rocks the docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises and, half
carrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles toward a
shuttle.

131  EXT DEATH STAR

The Millennium Falcon leads a swerving bomb run through the immense
superstructure of the half-built Death Star. The Rebel Star Cruisers
outside continually bombard the huge station. And each direct hit is
answered by resonating, chain-reaction explosions within the station
itself.

132  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT AND GUN PORTS

Lando's crew fires away at the pursuing TIE fighters as the dashing
Baron of Bespin and his alien copilot home in on the main reactor
shaft. It is awesome. A lone X-wing is just in front of the Falcon.

WEDGE
There it is!

LANDO
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.

WEDGE
Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.

The X-wing heads for the top of the huge reactor and fires several
proton torpedoes at the power regulator, causing a series of small
explosions.

The Falcon heads for the main reactor, and when it is dangerously
close, Lando fires the missiles, which shoot out of the Falcon with a
powerful roar, and hit directly at the center of the main reactor.

He maneuvers the Falcon out of the winding superstructure just ahead of
the continuing chain of explosions.

133  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE

Ackbar and other Mon Calamari lean on the railing of the bridge,
watching the large screen showing the Death Star in the main briefing
room.

ACKBAR
Move the fleet away from the Death Star.

134  EXT DEATH STAR

An Imperial shuttle, with Luke alone in the cockpit, rockets out of the
main docking bay as that entire section of the Death Star is blown
away.

Finally, just as it looks like the Falcon will not make it, Lando
expertly pilots the craft out of the exploding superstructure and
whizzes toward the Sanctuary Moon, only a moment before the Death Star
supernovas into oblivion.

135  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT

Lando and Nien Nunb laugh and cheer in relief.

136  EXT ENDOR FOREST

Han and Leia, Chewie, the droids, the Rebel troops, and the Ewoks all
look to the sky as the Death Star reveals itself in a final flash of
self-destruction. They all cheer.

THREEPIO
They did it!

Han looks town from the sky to Leia, a look of concern on his face.
Leia continues to look at the sky as though listening for a silent
voice.

HAN
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.

LEIA
He wasn't. I can feel it.

HAN
You love him, don't you?

Leia smiles, puzzled.

LEIA
Yes.

HAN
All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the
way.

She realizes his misunderstanding.

LEIA
Oh. No, it's not like that at all. He's my brother.

Han is stunned by this news. She smiles, and they embrace.

137  EXT ENDOR FOREST - NIGHT

Luke sets a torch to the logs stacked under a funeral pyre where his
father's body lies, again dressed in black mask and helmet. He stands,
watching sadly, as the flames leap higher to consume Darth Vader --
Anakin Skywalker.

In the sky above, fireworks explode and Rebel fighters zoom above the
forest.

138  EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT

A huge bonfire is the centerpiece of a wild celebration. Rebels and
Ewoks rejoice in the warm glow of firelight, drums beating, singing,
dancing, and laughing in the communal language of victory and
liberation.

Lando runs in and is enthusiastically hugged by Han and Chewie. Then,
finally, Luke arrives and the friends rush to greet and embrace him.
They stand close, this hardy group, taking comfort in each other's
touch, together to the end.

Rebels and Ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. The original
group of adventurers watch from the sidelines. Only Luke seems
distracted, alone in their midsts, his thoughts elsewhere.

He looks off to the side and sees three shimmering, smiling figures at
the edge of the shadows: Ben Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker.

EPISODE VII

THE FORCE AWAKENS



Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence,
the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the
ashes of the Empire and will not rest until
Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed.
With the support of the REPUBLIC, General
Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is
desperate to find her brother Luke and gain
his help in restoring peace and justice to
the galaxy.

Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret
mission to Jakku, where an old ally has
discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts....


PAN across the star field to a bright moon. A RUMBLING is
FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen --
HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the
moon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a
hangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant
planet. Jakku. MUSIC BUILDS AND WE...

CUT TO BLACK.

A GROWING ROAR of MEAN ENGINES -- gnarled RADIO CALLS, the
SHUDDERING of a ship's hull. Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an
instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER
STORMTROOPER, then it's gone.

The FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We

ARE IN:

INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT

TWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to
the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. A
FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster
rifles. The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING

QUIET:

EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

WIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. Distant sounds of
native animals. A single wind chime.
Suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY,
orange and white, this is BB-8.
Focuses on something past camera. He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE
CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. Moves EVEN CLOSER TO
CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND

ROLLS OFF FAST --

INT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT

CLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm.
The hand closes. Another OLDER HAND covers it.
In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged,
kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in
a pilot's jacket). Poe has charisma, a natural spark:

LOR SAN TEKKA
This will begin to make things right.
I've traveled too far, and seen too
much, to ignore the despair in the
galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can
be no balance in the Force.

POE
Well, because of you now we have a
chance. The General's been after
this for a long time.

LOR SAN TEKKA
"The General." To me, she's royalty.
Well, she certainly is that.

POE
BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San
Tekka.

POE (CONT'D)
We've got company.

EXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT

The men exit fast. Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS.
POE'S POV: LIGHTS on the horizon -- approaching ENEMY SHIPS.
POE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A

GROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER.

POE
You have to hide.

LOR SAN TEKKA
You have to leave. Go!
Poe turns to him. Conflicted. Finally nods, hurries off.
BB-8 follows.

EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

TRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village,
various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position, prepared to defend.

EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

A ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers
come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK -- many
are HIT!

EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT

Poe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the
village, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING.

POE
Come on, BB-8! Hurry!
Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket   co-pilot seat -- he
moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the
CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES

IN THE DISTANCE.
Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS.
The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE!
But just then:
Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to
look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING!

POE (CONT'D)
I see 'em!
BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT
THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster!
The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS!
Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER.
Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the
back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL.
They're in trouble.

EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

Lor San Tekka moves sadly through the village as STORMTROOPERS
wielding FLAME THROWERS destroy structures. Surrendering
Villagers are ROUNDED UP. Penned ANIMALS panic.

EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE - NIGHT

Back at the X-wing, Poe kneels beneath his ship, pulls from
the leather sack a SMALL, OLD ARTIFACT which he inserts into
BB-8 -- the droid's MULTI-READER ENVELOPS it.

POE
You take this. It's safer with you
than it is with me. You get as far
away from here as you can. Do you
hear me?
(BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates)
I'll come back for you! It will be
alright.




BB-8 watches Poe run off. BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns
and heads off. Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS
AWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers
from cover.

EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

The Troopers and villagers in battle -- as one Trooper is
HIT and goes down. Another -- OUR TROOPER -- KNEELS to help.
The hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- his HUMAN
HAND visible -- and MARKS OUR STORMTROOPER'S MASK WITH BLOOD
just before he dies. Our Trooper, stands -- overwhelmed by
the battle.

AN IMPOSING SHUTTLE CRAFT -- VERTICAL WINGSPAN 90 FEET TALL --

LANDS NEAR THE TRANSPORT VEHICLES.
The shuttle craft door OPENS -- through the wind and smoke,
KYLO REN exits the ship: a TALL, DARK FIGURE, he strides
through the chaos toward San Tekka.
A senior Trooper moves to our blood-marked Trooper, and orders

HIM:

SENIOR TROOPER
Stay here.
Our Trooper nods.
Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing
him. Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a
DARK MASK, marked by battle. Inset metal lines reflect FIRE.

KYLO REN
Look how old you've become.

LOR SAN TEKKA
Something far worse has happened to
you.
Our blood-marked TROOPER is placed in line with other
stormtroopers.

KYLO REN
You know what I've come for.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: LOR SAN TEKKA
I know where you come from. Before
you called yourself Kylo Ren.

KYLO REN
The map to Skywalker. We know you've
found it, and now you're going to
give it to the First Order.
Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren San
Tekka exchange continue.

LOR SAN TEKKA
The First Order rose from the dark
side... you did not.

KYLO REN
I'll show you the dark side.

LOR SAN TEKKA
You may try, but you cannot deny the
truth that is your family.
Suddenly Kylo Ren raises his LIGHTSABER -- IGNITES IT --

PERPENDICULAR SMALLER BLADES AT THE HILT, A UNIQUE BUZZ --

YELLOW RED ENERGY, SPITTING SPARKS AND SMOKE --

KYLO REN
You're so right.
And as he RIPS IT DOWN ACROSS SAN TEKKA!
Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES
AT KYLO REN! Instantly:
Kylo Ren RAISES HIS HAND -- POE'S BLAST FREEZES -- THE BOLT

OF ENERGY STRAINING AND VIBRATING IN MID AIR!
Kylo Ren sees Poe, who suddenly CANNOT MOVE, but strains to.
He is grabbed by Stormtroopers who drag him past the
VIBRATING, FROZEN BLAST, to Kylo Ren.
A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves
closer. Poe just glares. The Stormtrooper KICKS OUT Poe's
legs -- he lands hard on his knees.
Kylo Ren kneels to look at Poe.

POE
So who talks first? You talk first?

KYLO REN
The old man gave it to you.

POE

(INDICATES KYLO'S

MASK)
It's just very hard to understand
you with all the...







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

KYLO REN

(TO TROOPERS)
Search him.

POE
... Apparatus.
The Troopers roughly pull Poe away. A Stormtrooper begins a
brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer.
Poe just glares as the pat down ends.

STORMTROOPER  1
Nothing, sir.

KYLO REN
Put him on board.
Kylo Ren regards the Stormtroopers with the rounded up
Villagers, then turns to the CHROME-SKINNED, FEMALE BLACK-

CAPED HEAD STORMTROOPER, CAPTAIN PHASMA.

CAPTAIN PHASMA
Sir, the villagers.

KYLO REN
Kill them all.
Phasma nods, steps forward:

CAPTAIN PHASMA
On my command!
The Troopers, including OURS, aim at the Villagers.

CAPTAIN PHASMA (CONT'D)
Fire!
Poe is roughly PULLED into a transport ship, the ramp LIFTS.
All around our Trooper BLASTERFIRE ERUPTS -- but we're WIDE
ENOUGH to see he ISN'T FIRING. PUSH IN until the FIRING
STOPS. All the Stormtroopers SPREAD OUT TO SEARCH -- except
ours.
Kylo Ren heads back toward his ship. But then he STOPS.
Feels something. TURNS AND LOOKS AT OUR STORMTROOPER for a
LONG MOMENT. Our Trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows
he's doomed.
Kylo Ren then heads off -- passes the FROZEN BLAST, which,
after a beat, GOES FREE AND SLAMS INTO A NEARBY STRUCTURE,
scaring the hell out of our Stormtrooper.

EXT. EDGE OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

A Stormtrooper climbs down from the cockpit of Poe's X-wing,

BACKS AWAY:





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

STORMTROOPER  2
Nothing here. Go ahead!
Three other Stormtroopers FIRE LASER CANNONS at the X-wing --
destroying the ship in a LARGE EXPLOSION.

EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

BB-8 rolls across the sand, looks back: the X-wing FIREBALL.
BB-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark
desert. We see a FORM -- an animal, its RED EYES LIFTING
from the sand, watching the rolling droid, who just keeps
going.
In a WIDE SHOT, we HEAR HIM BEEPING to himself, lonely and
frightened.

EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

With the SANDY PLANET OF JAKKU as backdrop, Troop Transports
and Kylo Ren's Shuttle approach a massive STAR DESTROYER.

INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - NIGHT

Poe, shackled, is ushered from the transport through the
hangar. He is awed by the imposing space.

POE
All right. All right!
Our Stormtrooper passes, moves fast:

INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT

Our Stormtrooper enters the dark, vehicle. He removes his
helmet. His head comes up and we PUSH IN ON HIS FACE FOR
THE FIRST TIME. This is FN-2187. He is 23, likable. But
in this moment, terrified, desperate.
After a beat, behind him, CAPTAIN PHASMA enters. FN-2187
knows he's in trouble.

CAPTAIN PHASMA
FN-2187. Submit your blaster for
inspection.

FN-2187
Yes, Captain.

CAPTAIN PHASMA
And who gave you permission to remove
that helmet?

FN-2187
I'm sorry, Captain.

CAPTAIN PHASMA
Report to my division at once.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Phasma heads off. Shattered, FN-2187 replaces his helmet.

CUT TO:

INT. JUNKED VESSEL CORRIDOR - DAY

A metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face
of A SCAVENGER, perhaps alien, in GOGGLES, FACE MASK and
GLOVES. Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it. Uses TOOLS
to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. We are
in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a
valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL.
Swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable,
between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to:

INT. JUNKED VESSEL - LARGER SPACE - LATER

Alone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the Scavenger
descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. LANDS
HARD onto rusty metal.

INT. JUNKED VESSEL - ENGINES - DAY

The Scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found
piece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through
the dust toward a distant SLIT OF SUNLIGHT.

EXT. JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY

The Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles
and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young
WOMAN. This is REY, 19.
She opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into
her mouth. HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for
whatever she can get. CUT WIDE:
Rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC

ENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND
of her canteen-hitting. She sets her things on a piece of
sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune.
She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG
TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant
SALT FLATS below. Random SCATTERED DEBRIS. Her SPEEDER,
tiny from here.
Rey moves to her junker SPEEDER, jumps on, fires the sputtery
engine and DRIVES OFF.

EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

Rey races along the desert floor: a GRAVEYARD OF CRASHED

SPACESHIPS.

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

Rey's speeder PASSES us, heading for a dusty, desert town.
Refueling, small trade, scavengers.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
CRASH! Rey's sack carrying her heavy FOUND OBJECTS hits the
sand. Working like a tough seaman, Rey hauls the sack from
her speeder toward the town.

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - CLEANING TABLE - DAY

TIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage.
Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning
some salvage.
Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. A small,
passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another
language. She returns to work.

INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY

Rey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind
a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish,
unclean). He examines her pieces. Then he offers:

UNKAR
What you've brought me today is
worth... Hmmm... One quarter
portion.
Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks.
Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET:
DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another.
She takes it.
She swallows her resentment and heads off.

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

The IMMENSE SETTING SUN against the FLAT TERRAIN. Rey's
SPEEDER races, almost insignificant, across frame.

INT. REY'S DWELLING - DAY

She SCRATCHES MARKS into the rusty wall. Another MARK;
another DAY. And there are THOUSANDS of marks.
A SIZZLING SOUND over: A DRIED DESERT FLOWER in a rusty ENGINE
PIECE. A rough, stuffed HANDMADE DOLL, made from what looks
like orange Rebellion flight suit material and twine.
Rey's lonely, ramshackle dwelling. Everything reclaimed.
She cooks for one. Does everything for one. She opens the
POWDER, moves to the makeshift WOK, where the GREEN MEAT
SIZZLES. Pours the powder into milky WATER in a tin. Stirs
it. It GROWS INTO A LOAF as she puts the meat on an old
plate. Grabs the loaf.

EXT. REY'S DWELLING - DUSK

Rey sits, eats like a starving child. Every last drop.
Licks the metal plate. Looks out at the horizon. A single
silent ship heads off, a shimmering, thin contrail. She
wipes her mouth. Picks up an old, broken REBELLION HELMET.



(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: just 'cause.
Puts it on,
WIDE SHOT of Rey sitting, alone and isolated, on the leg of
an ANCIENT, FALLEN AT-AT in which she lives.
Then, a distant ELECTRONIC SQUEAL -- instantly she's up,
helmet too big, she rips it off. Hears ANOTHER BEEPING
SQUEAL. She hurries to her QUARTERSTAFF and runs off.
Rey climbs a dune. RISE WITH HER, revealing BB-8, caught in
a NET but fighting back, being held by a TEEDO (a small,
brutish desert tyrant), who rides a LUGGABEAST. The teedo
YELLS at BB-8, who BEEPS madly, struggling to free himself.
Rey watches this injustice for a beat, finally YELLING OUT:

REY
Tal'ama parqual!
The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her.

REY (CONT'D)
Parqual zatana!
A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening.
BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching
a tennis match.
Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch.
Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. The Teedo freaks
out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and
says, fiercely:

REY (CONT'D)

NOMA.
The Teedo barks a sort of "AHHHHH!" (As if to say, "GO TO
HELL!"), Then heads off on his beast. This prompts BB-8 to
start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively.

REY (CONT'D)
Shhhh.
BB-8 quiets instantly. The two watch the Teedo head off.
Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. She KNEELS to him.

REY (CONT'D)
That's just Teedo. Wants you for
parts. He has no respect for anyone.
Your antenna's bent.
(considers BB-8 for
the first time,

STRAIGHTENS THE

ANTENNA)
Where do you come from?

(BB-8 BEEPS)
Classified. Really? Me too. Big
secret.
(points to horizon)
Niima Outpost is that way, stay off
Kelvin Ridge.

(MORE)



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY (CONT'D)
Keep away from the Sinking Fields in
the north, you'll drown in the sand.
(stands, heads off)


BB-8 starts after her, BEEPS. She turns sharply, he stops.





REY (CONT'D)
Don't follow me. Town is that way.
(he BEEPS again)
No!
She heads off again. Finally he BEEPS to her -- something
SWEET this time. That he is alone, scared, has no one else.
This makes her stop. She turns and looks at him. Not liking
him. But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, "Come
on." BB-8 quickly moves to her. They head off together.

REY (CONT'D)
In the morning, you go.

(HE BEEPS)
You're welcome.
The two disappear behind a dune.

EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

Three TIE fighters head to the massive ship high above Jakku.

INT. STAR DESTROYER HOLDING CELL - DAY

POE, shackled to a chair, BEATEN, wakes up.

KYLO REN
I had no idea we had the best pilot
in the Resistance on board.
Comfortable?
Through battered lips:

POE
Not really.

KYLO REN
I'm impressed. No one has been able
to get out of you what you did with
the map.

POE
Might wanna rethink your technique.
Kylo Ren says nothing, reaches out to him. Poe flinches in
the chair as Kylo Ren reaches for his face, not touching
him. Poe is soon in agony, remains in horrible silence --

KYLO REN
Where is it?





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

POE
The Resistance will not be intimidated
by you.

KYLO REN
Where... is it?
Poe can't take it -- he BEGINS TO SCREAM and we CUT TO:

INT. STAR DESTROYER CORRIDOR - DAY

WHOOOSH! The cell door SLIDES UP. Kylo Ren exits, fierce,
confronts GENERAL HUX (34, scary) who awaits him:

KYLO REN
It's in a droid. A BB unit.

GENERAL HUX
Well then. If it's on Jakku, we'll
soon have it.

KYLO REN
I leave that to you.

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

BB-8 is dropped to the sand.

REY
Don't give up. He still might show
up. Whoever it is you're waiting
for. Classified. I know all about
waiting.
BB-8 BEEPTALKS a question.

REY (CONT'D)
For my family. They'll be back.
One day. Come on.
She tries to force a smile, but can't, really. She heads
off. BB-8 BEEPS... then heads after her.

INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY

Rey stands with BB-8 in front of Unkar Plutt, at his window.
He reviews her goods. He glances quickly at BB-8.

UNKAR
These five pieces are worth... Let
me see here... One half portion.

REY

(OBJECTS)
Last week they were a half portion
each.
She hates him. He leans forward.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

UNKAR
What about the droid?

REY
What about him?

UNKAR
I'll pay for him.
BB-8 doesn't like this at all. Rey is awkward, but curious.

UNKAR (CONT'D)
Sixty portions.
CLOSE ON HER. Stunned. Literally hungry for this amount of
food, her stomach practically rumbles.
BB-8 sees her interest and BEEPS furiously, not liking this
conversation at all.
She looks at Unkar. Looks down at BB-8. Considers it all.
Finally, she hears herself say:

REY
Actually... the droid's not for sale.

(TO BB-8)
Come on.
Unkar furious. Rey, then BB-8, head out. Recovering, Unkar
watches her go with dark eyes. He picks up a communicator:

UNKAR
Follow the girl and get that droid.
He SLAMS the service window door SHUT.

INT. STAR DESTROYER HOLDING CELL - DAY

The cell door WHOOSHES OPEN -- a STORMTROOPER enters. Poe
remains shackled, worse for wear. A TROOPER GUARD here.

STORMTROOPER
Ren wants the prisoner.
TIGHT ON POE, in pain, drained, as the Guard unshackles him.

INT. STAR DESTROYER CORRIDOR - DAY

An exhausted, handcuffed Poe is walked down the corridor by
the Stormtrooper, who holds a blaster at Poe's body.

STORMTROOPER
Turn here.
Poe turns into a narrow passageway --

INT. STAR DESTROYER NARROW PASSAGEWAY - DAY

Heading down the narrow hall the Stormtrooper stops Poe.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

STORMTROOPER
Listen carefully: you do exactly as
I say, I can get you out of here.

POE

(COMING TO)
If -- what--?
The Stormtrooper pulls off his helmet: IT IS FN-2187.

FN-2187
This is a rescue, I'm helping you
escape. Can you fly a TIE fighter?

POE
You with the Resistance--?!

FN-2187
What?

(THAT'S CRAZY)
No no no! I'm breaking you out.
Can you fly a TIE fighter?

POE
I can fly anything. Why, why are
you helping me?

FN-2187
Because it's the right thing to do.

POE
(it hits him)
You need a pilot.

FN-2187
I need a pilot.
And Poe, seeing this is for real, smiles a hero's smile.

POE
We're gonna do this.

FN-2187
(unsure but hopeful)
... Yeah?

INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - DAY

WIDE SHOT ESTABLISHING the hangar. Find FN-2187, again
masked, walking with Poe. By all appearances he's escorting
a prisoner. A group of OFFICERS passes in the opposite
direction.

FN-2187
Okay, stay calm, stay calm.

POE
I am calm.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FN-2187
I'm talking to myself.

(BEAT)
Not yet. Okay, go. This way.
FN-2187 walks quickly toward the far wall -- Poe follows --
up the stairs to a two-man SPECIAL FORCES TIE FIGHTER --

INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

FN-2187 and Poe (wincing, sore) drop into the back-to-back
cockpit. FN-2187 pulls off his helmet as Poe removes his
cuffs and jacket, fires up the ship with excitement.

POE
I always wanted to fly one of these
things. Can ya shoot?

FN-2187
Blasters, I can!

POE
Okay, same principal! Use the toggle
on the left to switch between
missiles, cannons, and mag pulse --
use the site on the right to aim,
triggers to fire!

FN-2187
This is very complicated
FWOOOOOOM! The TIE FIGHTER LURCHES FORWARD --

POE
I can fix this.

INT. HANGAR SIX CONTROL ROOM - DAY

WIDE: see the ship STRUGGLE TO RISE, CABLES connected to it --
PULL BACK FAST to REVEAL we're inside the main control room.

STAR DESTROYER TECHNICIAN
We have an unsanctioned departure
from bay two.
WHIP TO a FIRST ORDER COLONEL, who responds:

FIRST ORDER COLONEL
Alert General Hux and stop that
fighter.

INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - DAY

The TIE Fighter LIFTS OFF from the bay, rips CHARGING cables!
Stormtroopers UNPACK and aim MEGABLASTERS.

INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

FN-2187 opens fire.

INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - DAY

FN-2187 TEARS UP PARKED TIE FIGHTERS and GUN EMPLACEMENTS
WITH WELL-AIMED, STRATEGIC LASER BLASTS! Hits the CONTROL

ROOM!

INT. HANGAR SIX CONTROL ROOM - DAY


THE WINDOWS ARE BLOWN IN BY LASER BLASTS!

INT. TIE FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY


POE
I got it!

EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

The TIE Fighter blasts from the ship --

INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

Poe pilots -- amazed, almost enjoying it.

POE
Woooahhh! This thing really moves.
All right, we gotta take out as many
cannons as we can or we're not gonna
get very far!

FN-2187
All right!

POE
I'm gonna get us in position, just
stay sharp!

EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

The TIE Fighter ARCS BACK, DIVES THROUGH THE OPENING BETWEEN
THE LEVELS OF THE MASSIVE SHIP, then FLIES DOWN AND BACK,
along the ship's belly --

INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

Poe flies toward the CANONS --

POE
Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it?
I've got us dead centered. It's a
clean shot.

FN-2187
Okay, got it.
FN-2187 gets a target, FIRES!

EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

LASERS BLAST from the TIE Fighter -- A SERIES OF CANNONS
EXPLODE! Our TIE Fighter SLICES THROUGH the debris!

INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

FN-2187 YELLS in celebration:

FN-2187
YES! You see that?! DID YOU SEE

THAT?

POE
I saw it! Hey, what's your name?

FN-2187

FN-2187!
Poe reacts, this tells him volumes about FN-2187's history.

POE
FN-whaa?

FN-2187
That's the only name they ever gave
me!

POE
Well I ain't using it! FN, huh?
Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn!
That all right?
Even in the madness, Finn can't suppress his smile.

FINN
"Finn." Yeah, "Finn", I like that!
I like that!

POE
I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.

FINN
Good to meet you, Poe!

POE
Good to meet you too, Finn!

INT. STAR DESTROYER MAIN BRIDGE - DAY

General Hux looks over the shoulder of LIEUTENANT MITAKA, at
a console.

LIEUTENANT MITAKA
Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers--

GENERAL HUX
Use the ventral cannons.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

LIEUTENANT MITAKA
Yes, sir. Bringing them online --

KYLO REN (O.S.)
General Hux. Is it the Resistance
pilot?
Hux turns: Kylo Ren enters fast, looms large, angry.

GENERAL HUX
Yes, and he had help.

(VEXED)
From one of our own.
PUSH IN ON REN as Hux says:

GENERAL HUX (CONT'D)
We're checking the registers now to
identify which Stormtrooper it was.

KYLO REN
... The one from the village. FN-

2187.
Hux is unnerved that Ren knows -- he chalks it up to Ren's
Force ability. Kylo Ren heads off.

LIEUTENANT MITAKA
Sir. Ventral cannons hot.

GENERAL HUX
Fire.

EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

Massive WARHEAD LAUNCHERS SPIN and FIRE BLASTS toward the
TIE fighter, which flies EVASIVE MANEUVERS -- most blasts
hit the DEBRIS from the TURBOLASER DESTRUCTION.
The TIE fighter then PULLS A BIG TURN, BACK TOWARD JAKKU,

THE SANDY PLANET WHERE POE LEFT BB-8.

INT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY


POE
One's coming towards you. My right,
your left. Do you see it?

FINN
Hold on! I see it!

POE
Nice shot.
Finn looks up suddenly in alarm --

FINN
Where are you going?





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

POE
We're going back to Jakku. That's
where.

FINN
No no no! We can't go back to Jakku!
We need to get outta this system!
NEAR-MISS LASER BLASTS as Poe pilots aggressively.

POE
I got to get to my droid before the
First Order does!

FINN
What - a droid?!

POE
That's right. He's a BB unit! Orange
and white: one of a kind.

FINN
I don't care what color he is! No
droid can be that important!

POE
This one is, pal.

FINN
We need to get as far away from the
First Order as we can! We go back
to Jakku, we die!

POE
That droid's got a map that leads
straight to Luke Skywalker!

FINN
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!!! I--
Suddenly BAM! THEY ARE HIT!

EXT. TIE FIGHTER - DAY

The TIE FIGHTER SPARKS AND SMOKES, SPIRALING out of control
toward the surface of Jakku!

INT. STAR DESTROYER MAIN BRIDGE - DAY

Captain Phasma and General Hux stand before a holographic
projection detailing FN-2187's service records.

CAPTAIN PHASMA
FN-2187 reported to my division, was
evaluated and sent to Reconditioning.

GENERAL HUX
No prior signs of non-conformity?





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

CAPTAIN PHASMA
This was his first offense.
A technician checks her readings, reports to General Hux.

TECHNICIAN  1
General. They've been hit.

GENERAL HUX
Destroyed?

TECHNICIAN  1

(GETTING READINGS)
Disabled. They were headed back to
Jakku -- the fighter's projected to
crash in the Goazon badlands.

GENERAL HUX
They were going back for the droid --
send a squad to the wreckage.

EXT. JAKKU DESERT - DAY

TIGHT ON FINN'S FACE: His EYES OPEN. He goes from unconscious
to terrified, fast. He sits up, looks around. CUT BACK
WIDE: he sits in the middle of an EPIC DESERT, DUNES FOREVER.
A BLACK CHUTE blows in the wind behind him, scattered debris.
Then he sees, over distant dunes, RISING BLACK SMOKE. He
gets up -- moves toward it, calling out:

FINN
Poe! Poe!
Finn scrambles over the massive dune to the TIE FIGHTER,
SMOKING AND ON FIRE, small debris around it. He thinks he
sees POE'S ARM -- he pulls on it, but it's JUST POE'S JACKET.
He throws that off and tries to find a way in -- even a way
to LOOK INSIDE, but the smoke and heat make it impossible.

FINN (CONT'D)
Poe!!! POE!
Suddenly the ship BEGINS TO SINK -- like it's being CONSUMED
INTO QUICKSAND -- Finn is slipping in too --

FINN (CONT'D)

POE!!! POE!!!
It becomes clear fast: if Finn doesn't get away, he's gonna
get sucked in too! So Finn scampers away from the TIE FIGHTER
as it SINKS INTO THE SAND! We're in the Sinking Fields. A
few moments and IT'S GONE.
Finn's out of breath. Horrified. Then A GIANT EXPLOSION
ERUPTS FROM below, SENDING SAND AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE!
Finn sees this, disoriented, scared, exhausted and defeated.
And all alone.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

ENDLESS DUNES BEHIND HIM, Finn walks, removing pieces of his
Stormtrooper gear, using Poe's FLIGHT JACKET for shade.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Exhausted, Finn continues his trek across the endless, sandy
nothingness.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Finn, parched and losing hope, he walks to the edge of a
massive dune, looks out into the epic valley below. Miles
ahead: NIIMA OUTPOST.

INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE - DAY

General Hux and Kylo Ren walk the length of the bridge.

GENERAL HUX
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit.
Capture the droid if we can, but
destroy it if we must.

KYLO REN
How capable are your soldiers,
General?

GENERAL HUX

(WITH VITRIOL)
I won't have you question my methods.

KYLO REN
They're obviously skilled at
committing high treason. Perhaps
Leader Snoke should consider using a
clone army.

GENERAL HUX

(YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH)
My men are exceptionally trained --
programmed from birth--

KYLO REN
Then they should have no problem
retrieving the droid. Unharmed.

GENERAL HUX
Careful, Ren. That your "personal
interests" not interfere with orders
from Leader Snoke.

KYLO REN
I want that map. For your sake, I
suggest you get it.
Ren heads off. Hux hates him.

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

Sun-scorched and exhausted, Finn stumbles out of the desert
into the Outpost. In a heatstroke daze he moves past enormous
old SHIP PARTS, MERCHANTS, SCAVENGERS and TENTED STALLS.

FINN
Water... water... water..
He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like
creature (a HAPPABORE) DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his
hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple
swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted.

FINN (CONT'D)
-- Awgh, GAH!
But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE.
ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphatically

BEEPING BB-8.
Just then, TWO of UNKAR'S THUGS approach and stop her. One
clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. BB-8 reacts
nervously as Rey resists them -- one pulls a SACK over BB-8
while the other grabs Rey's arm -- in the tussle, Rey KNOCKS
OVER METAL URNS for sale --
Finn, still drinking, is PUSHED OVER by the happabore. He
falls to the ground, then turns to look when he HEARS
CRASHING. He sees, through the tents, REY FIGHTING.
He moves UP CLOSER to help this young woman being accosted --
but he STOPS when Rey begins to FIGHT BACK -- scrappy and
feral, she KICKS, BITES and HITS. Finn is taken aback as
she DEFEATS the attackers, who hit the sand, hard.
Finn just watches, stunned.
Rey moves to the COVERED BB-8 -- PULLS THE SACK OFF OF HIM.
Finn cannot believe his eyes. IT'S POE'S DROID!
Rey talks to BB-8, who, nervous now, looks around and...
SEES FINN! BB-8 STARTS BEEPING like crazy. Then something
insane happens: REY LOOKS AT FINN.

REY
(To BB-8) Who? Him?
Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant.
Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT
HIM, quarterstaff in hand.
Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from
her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he
turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got
ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF!
Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She
holds the staff on him threateningly:

REY
What's your hurry, thief?

FINN
What--?! Thief?
BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES

FROM HIS BODY AND SHOCKS FINN!

FINN (CONT'D)
OW! HEY! What?!

REY
The jacket! This droid says you
stole it!

FINN
I've had a pretty messed up day,
alright?! So I'd appreciate it you
stop accusing me -- OW!!!
(BB-8 has ZAPPED him

AGAIN)

STOP IT!

REY
Where'd you get it? It belongs to
his master.
Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind
racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs
heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard
decision: to tell the truth.

FINN
It belonged to Poe Dameron. That
was his name, right?
Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more.

FINN (CONT'D)
He was captured... by the First Order!
I helped him escape but our ship
crashed.

(RELIVING IT)
Poe didn't make it.
(sees BB-8 is sad,

ROLLS OFF)
Look, I tried to help him. I'm
sorry...
BB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. Rey watches BB-8,
then considers Finn again. Says, a bit impressed:

REY
So you're with the Resistance?



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Finn's mind races again. He makes an easy decision: to lie.

FINN
Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with
the Resistance, yeah.

(WHISPERS)
I'm with the Resistance.
Rey lowers her staff, Finn stands. Rey studies him:

REY
I've never met a Resistance fighter
before.

FINN
Well, this is what we look like.
Some of us. Others look different.

REY
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission,
he has to get back to your base.

FINN
Apparently he's carrying a map that
leads to Luke Skywalker, and
everyone's after it.
She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks:

REY
Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a
myth.
Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees.

REY (CONT'D)
What is it?
Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves
to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S
THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY!
Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents:

REY (CONT'D)
(re: her hand)
What are you doing?!

FINN
Come on!
Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT,
SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS -- MORE BLASTS as they run!

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

Finn and Rey holding hands, the three race, ZIGZAGGING through
a maze of tents:







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN
Come on, BB-8!

REY
Let go of me!

FINN
No, we gotta move!

REY
(pulls her hand back)
I know how to run without you holding
my hand! BB-8 stay close! This
way!
Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing
them! They disappear through a tent.
TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They
come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET.

STORMTROOPER
Call in the air strike!
REY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent:

INT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY

Rey, Finn and BB-8 move through RUSTY WARES and take cover.
Quiet, urgent:

REY
They're shooting at both of us!

FINN
Yeah, they saw you with me! You're
marked!

REY
Well, thanks for that!

FINN
I'm not the one who chased you down
with a stick! Does anyone have
blasters around here?!

REY

(TO BB-8)
Are you okay?
Finn QUIETS HER WITH A GESTURE, HEARING SOMETHING.
PUSH IN ON FINN -- whatever he hears alarms him greatly --
he GRABS HER HAND AGAIN -- PULLS HER AWAY --

REY (CONT'D)
Stop taking my hand!

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY

Finn pulls Rey from the tent -- BB-8 FOLLOWS --
As they race from the tent a TIE FIGHTER SCREAMS INTO VIEW

FROM BEHIND THE TENTS! A SECOND FOLLOWS CLOSE BEHIND. IT

FIRES AT THEM -- A MASSIVE BLAST SENDS REY AND FINN FLYING --

BB-8 ROLLING!




WIDE SHOT: TWO TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM OVER the town, the
EXPLOSION throws sand and debris fifty feet into the air.
Rey is thrown HARD to the ground -- she is rattled, truly
afraid. Then she turns: FINN lies nearby, unconscious.
Suddenly afraid, she scrambles to him, rolls him over. BB-8
ROLLS OVER, BEEPING in concern.

REY
Hey!
As Finn comes to, he sees her. Through his fog:

FINN
-- Are you okay?
And that very question touches her -- having never in her
life been asked it.

REY
Yeah.
(extends her hand)
Follow me.
Grateful, Finn takes it. They're off.
LOCALS run amok as TIE fighters DIVE BOMB. REY, Finn and BB-

8 SPRINT, BLASTER EXPLOSIONS GET CLOSER AND CLOSER!

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - SPACEPORT - DAY

Rey, STAFF strapped to her back, leads the way as she, Finn
and BB-8 race into the spaceport. Finn glances back: TWO
TIE FIGHTERS BANK their return. They YELL:

FINN
We can't outrun them!
Rey POINTS to a parked, four-engine SHIP ahead:

REY
We might in that quad-jumper!

FINN
We need a pilot!

REY
We've got one!





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN
You?!
(then, indicates one

OFF-CAMERA)
What about that ship?

REY
That one's garbage!
They run for the JUMPER but the passing TIE FIGHTERS FIRE AT
IT, BLOWING IT APART IN A HUGE FLAME BALL! Rey, coming to a
quick stop, RIGHT UP TO CAMERA:

REY (CONT'D)
The garbage'll do!
She turns and runs back -- Finn and BB-8 follow as they all
run toward the piece of junk -- and we see it for the first
time: THE MILLENNIUM FALCON!
TIE fighters BANK AROUND AGAIN. Finn, Rey and BB-8 run up
the ramp of the semi-tarped Falcon.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

Finn, Rey and BB-8 enter the ship -- she hits a control and
the door DESCENDS CLOSED as she races to the cockpit:

REY
Gunner position's down there!

FINN

(CLIMBS DOWN)
Y'ever fly this thing?

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Rey tosses her staff aside, jumps into the pilot's seat,
frantically flips switches. BB-8 rolls in behind her as the
ENGINES WHINE to life:

REY
No! This ship hasn't been flown in
years!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY

Finn buckles into the gunner seat -- to his shock the SEAT
WHIPS TO THE LEFT, startling him -- he grabs the controls to
steady himself.

FINN
Great.
(reacts to seat)
Whoa! I can do this, I can do this--

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Rey bucks herself up. Doesn't believe her quick words:



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY
I can do this, I can do this--
Rey pulls the yoke:

THE FALCON ENGINES LIGHT UP BRIGHT!

EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - SPACEPORT - DAY

The FALCON RISES, WILDLY -- ITS TARPS FLY OFF -- THE SHIP

SPINS AND TILTS, SLAMS INTO AND CRUMBLES THE TOWN'S ARCHWAY!
From the tents, Unkar Plutt runs out, SCREAMS:

UNKAR

HEY!!!! THAT'S MIIIIIIINE!!!
The Falcon BLASTS AWAY, two TIE FIGHTERS chase it, fast!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

Rey pilots, headed for the sky!
Finn SWINGS into frame, trying to work the GUNS.

FINN
Whoa! Hey! Oh! Stay low! Stay
low!

REY

WHAT?

FINN
Stay low! It confuses their tracking!
For a crazy instant Rey LETS GO OF THE YOKE, stretches to
the co-pilot controls -- THE FALCON CANTS!

REY
BB-8, hold on!
Rey finally REACHES the switches, returns to the yoke,
stabilizing the ship, afraid of this next move.

REY

I'M GOING LOW!!!

EXT. DESERT - DAY

BEHIND THE FALCON as it DRAMATICALLY BANKS AT AN UPWARD ARC,
UPSIDE-DOWN, then SWOOPS PERILOUSLY LOW across the sand.
Two TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM past us!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

In the cylindrical corridor, BB-8 ROLLS TO THE CEILING!
Rey looks back for a flash as the TIE Fighters pass -- They
are ROCKED BY A BLAST!



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY
What are you doing back there? Are
you ever gonna fire back?!


Finn flicks switches -- The GUN TARGETING LIGHTS UP:

FINN
I'm working on it! Are the shields
up?
Rey strains, reaching for something in the co-pilot seat.

REY
Not so easy without a co-pilot!
Finn struggles with the gun controls and SWEEPING CHAIR:

FINN
Try sitting in this thing!
Finn finally FIRES BACK at the two TIE FIGHTERS!

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Finn's shots MISS. The TIE FIGHTERS ARC BACK IN PURSUIT and
SCREAM PAST US toward the Falcon! Both TIES FIRING!

INT. TIE FIGHTER COCKPIT - DAY

The BLACK-SUITED PILOT FIRES at the Falcon.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY

The Falcon is ROCKED by another BLAST!

FINN
We need cover, quick!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Rey HITS SWITCHES, pilots the best she can:

REY
We're about to get some!

(TO HERSELF)
I hope.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

The Falcon speeds through a ROCK FORMATION, GRAZING THE ROCK,
TAKING OUT A CHUNK -- the two TIE Fighters in pursuit, FIRING!
The Falcon BANKS SO HARD, the edge of the ship RIPS A LINE
IN THE SAND as it turns, REVEALING THE SHIP GRAVEYARD AHEAD.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

BB-8 EXTENDS MAGNETIC CABLES to brace himself in a corridor.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Finn continues to fire at the TIE fighters, narrowly missing
them.

FINN
Damn it!
Rey maneuvers the ship deeper into the graveyard.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY

Finn SWOOPS into frame, FIRES --

FINN
Come on... come on...
-- HITS AND SHATTERS the TIE FIGHTER!

REY
Nice shot!

FINN
I'm getting pretty good at this!

EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

The TIE FIGHTER CRASHES amid the DEBRIS, THREE SCAVENGERS
instantly there to consume the new bounty.
The Falcon, pursued by the ONE REMAINING TIE FIGHTER, slaloms
through the MASSIVE WRECKAGE, GRAZING THE OLD SHIPS as she
goes, pieces flying.
The TIE FIGHTER FIRES -- HITTING THE FALCON'S LOWER TURRET,

SPINNING IT, JAMMING IT INTO FORWARD POSITION!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - GUNNER POSITION - DAY


ALARMS BLARE --

FINN
The cannon's stuck in forward
position, I can't move it! You gotta
lose 'em!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

The ship is HIT AGAIN -- afraid, Rey's mind races as she
scans the area -- and gets an idea.

REY
Get ready!

FINN
Okay! For what?

EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

Rey pilots the ship up AND INTO THE REAR OF A CRASHED SUPER
STAR DESTROYER! The final TIE FIGHTER FOLLOWS!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

Finn peers out the window, realizing where they are:

FINN

ARE WE REALLY DOING THIS?!

INT. WRECKED SUPER STAR DESTROYER - DAY

The two ships slalom debris inside the giant ship -- the
Falcon GRAZING ONE SIDE, THEN THE OTHER, SPITTING SPARKS!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

Rey, scared, girds herself as she quickly runs out of space
in the wreck.

REY
Oh no!
Just as the TIE PILOT GETS A LOCK,
Rey YANKS THE YOKE --

EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

The Falcon makes a HARD RIGHT TURN out of the Destroyer.
Rey then CUTS POWER AND FLIPS THE SHIP SO BACK FACES FRONT!
FINN CAN NOW SEE THE PURSUING TIE FIGHTER! He FIRES,

DESTROYING IT!
REY GUNS THE ENGINES again, FLIPS THE FALCON and FLIES AWAY
as the TIE FIGHTER CRASHES!

FINN
Whooo!
The Falcon ROARS OFF, victorious, leaving the ship graveyard
and disappearing into the clouds.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

The Falcon ROARS from Jakku off to space.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Rey excitedly unbuckles her seatbelt and hurries back.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - CORRIDOR - DAY

Rey races past BB-8, who is RETRACTING his safety restraints.
Finn, adrenalized, climbs from the turret, meets Rey in the
corridor, the LOUNGE in the b.g..









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: REY
FINN Good shooting! Thanks! I--
Now that was some I don't know! -- I've
flying! How did you flown some ships but I've
do that?! No one never left the planet!
trained you? No one? Your last shot was dead
That was amazing! on. You got him with one
(beat) blast!
You set me up for it! (laughs)
(cocky) It was perfect!
That was pretty good.
They're just staring at each other now, seeing something odd
and weird and wonderful -- two people totally inexperienced
in joy and camaraderie.
Bb-8 BEEPS something urgent -- she turns to the droid, kneels.

REY (CONT'D)
You're ok. He's with the Resistance.
He's going to get you home. We both
will.

(TO FINN)
I don't know your name.

FINN
Finn. What's yours.

REY
I'm Rey.
BB-8 looks at him: really? Finn is reminded: HE'S LIED TO
HER. She looks at Finn with a sweet smile.

FINN
Rey...
But before Finn can say anything they JUMP: across the lounge,
STEAM BURSTS from under the grating.

REY
Help me with this! Quick!
They hurry to the grating, PULL IT UP together. BB-8 rolls
over, watches.

FINN
Whoa! What's going on?
She goes below as BB-8 BEEPS concern.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

The First Order Star Destroyer above Jakku.

INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY

Lieutenant Mitaka moves to Ren, who looks out across the
star field. Mitaka swallows, uneasy with his task.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

LIEUTENANT MITAKA
Sir. We were unable to acquire the
droid on Jakku.
Ren turns to look at him, he says nothing.

LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D)
It escaped capture aboard a stolen
Corellian YT model freighter.

KYLO REN
The droid... stole a freighter?

LIEUTENANT MITAKA
Not exactly, sir. It had help.
Ren says nothing. Which says everything. Mitaka sweats.

LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D)
We have no confirmation, but we
believe FN-2187 may have been helped
in the escape--
Ren IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER, TURNS AND SLASHES AT THE CONSOLE
BEHIND HIM! HOLD ON Mitaka, who reacts, looks away -- winces.
The horrible SOUNDS of Ren's rage continues. Finally Mitaka
looks up. The metallic wall behind Ren is RIPPED with glowing
scars.

KYLO REN
Anything else?
Mitaka hates to say the following, but:

LIEUTENANT MITAKA
The two were accompanied by a girl.
Ren reaches out -- Mitaka is suddenly, violently PULLED TOWARD
REN, into his black glove:

KYLO REN
What girl?

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY

Rey's head POPS up from under the grating, surrounded by
STEAM. An EMERGENCY ALARM BLARES.

REY
It's the motivator! Grab me a Harris
wrench -- check in there!
As he checks a storage box, she disappears down below,
overwhelmed by the technical issues --

FINN
How bad is it?!







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY
If we wanna live, not good!
BB-8 watches as Finn searches A SELECTION OF TOOLS:

FINN
They're hunting for us now, we gotta
get outta this system!
Rey re-emerges, Finn hands her the wrench.

REY
BB-8 said the location of the
Resistance Base is "need to know" --
if I'm taking you there, I need to
know!

FINN
(Throws a tool)
This?
She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8
alone. He contemplates telling her the truth. This is his
moment. But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently:

FINN (CONT'D)
You gotta tell us where the base is.

(BB-8 BEEPS)
I don't speak that. Alright, between
us, I'm not with the Resistance,
okay?
(BB-8 backs up)
-- I'm just trying to get away from
the First Order -- but you tell us
where your base is, I'll get there
first -- deal?!
(BB-8 COCKS his head)
Droid, please.
Rey pops up again:

REY
Pilex driver, hurry!
Finn moves for the tool.

REY (CONT'D)
So where's your base?

FINN
(searching, to BB-8)
Go on BB-8, tell her.

(QUIETLY)
Please!
She and Finn look to BB-8 -- who considers the whole
situation, then BEEPS.







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY
The Ileenium system?
Finn hands her the tool, surprised but thrilled -- Rey
disappears below again.

FINN
Yeah, the Ileenium system, that's
the one -- get us there as fast as
you can.
A smiling Finn gives BB-8 a THUMBS UP. BB-8 quickly extends
his WELDING TORCH and TURNS IT UPWARD, then retracts it.

REY
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.
I need the bonding tape, hurry!

FINN
(searching for tape)
What about you?

REY
I gotta get back to Jakku!

FINN
(loses his mind)
BACK TO JAK--?! Why does everyone
always wanna go back to Jakku?! !

REY
No, that one! No. No. The one I'm
pointing to! No. NO. NO. If we
don't patch it up, the propulsion
tank will overflow and flood the
ship with poisonous gas!
Bb-8 has moved to Finn -- TIPS HIS HEAD, shows him the tool.
He throws her the tape, she disappears below:

FINN
This?

REY
Yes!

FINN
Hey. Rey. You're a pilot -- you
can fly anywhere! Why go back?!
You got a family? You got a
boyfriend? Cute boyfriend?
The STEAM and ALARM STOP as Rey pops up, annoyed:

REY
None of your business, THAT'S WHY!
But then: ALL THE SHIP POWER GOES OUT. BB-8 is nervous.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN
... That can't be good.

REY

(HEADS OFF)
-- No it can't be --

FINN FOLLOWS REY TO:

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

They plop into the seats, in a panic. She checks the dead

INSTRUMENTATION PANEL:

REY
Someone's locked onto us -- all
controls are overridden.
Finn quickly, awkwardly climbs up, looks out.

REY (CONT'D)
Get off. Get off! See anything?

FINN
... Oh no.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

The Millennium Falcon, powerless, is a sitting duck.
SOMETHING EPIC appears from ABOVE: THE ANTENNA ARRAY IS THE

FIRST WE SEE OF A MASSIVE FREIGHTER, ITS GIANT HANGAR OPEN

LIKE A HUGE MOUTH WHICH SWALLOWS THE FALCON LIKE A WHALE!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Finn PLOPS into his seat, horrified.

FINN
It's the First Order.

REY
What do we do-- there must be

SOMETHING --
Finn's mind races -- then:

FINN
You said poisonous gas --

REY
-- Yeah, but I fixed that --

FINN
Can you unfix it?
Rey stares at him -- and gets his plan! They head off --

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY

The GAS MASKS hanging in the lounge are GRABBED.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Finn and Rey, gas masks on, quickly climb into the open
grating area.

REY
C'mon BB-8.
They help BB-8 down, too: they both struggle like crazy, he
weighs a TON.

FINN
I got it.

REY
Oooh...

FINN
I'm okay. BB-8 get off me...

UNDER THE GRATING
Finn pulls the grating over them as Rey works on the controls.

REY
You think this'll work on the
Stormtroopers?

FINN
Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke,
not toxins.
LIGHTS COME ON! SOUND of the SHIP RAMP LOWERING! Finn PULLS
THE GRATING CLOSED as he says:

FINN (CONT'D)
Hurry!

REY
I'm hurrying!
Suddenly the FALCON DOOR OPENS -- AND HAN SOLO AND CHEWBACCA
BOARD THE FALCON, weapons at the ready. PUSH IN ON THEM,
ready for combat, operating silently, with hand signals only.

HAN
Chewie, we're home.
Han gives Chewie a nod to check out the ship. Chewie heads
off one way, Han in another.
The grating above LIFTS OFF -- hands in surrender, they look
up at Han, who's training his blaster on them, threatening.
They're SCARED.

HAN (CONT'D)
Where are the others? Where's the
pilot?

REY
...I'm the pilot...



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HAN
You?
Chewie MOAN-TALKS. Rey responds to him --

REY
No, it's true: we're the only ones
on board.

FINN
You can understand that thing?

HAN
And "that thing" can understand you
too, so watch it. Come on outta
there.
They climb up -- BB-8 uses his magnetic arm to quickly pull
himself out.

HAN (CONT'D)
Where'd you get this ship?

REY
Niima Outpost.

HAN
Jakku?! That junkyard?

FINN
Thank you! Junkyard!

HAN

(TO CHEWIE)
Told ya we should've double-checked
the Western Reaches!

(TO REY)
Who had it, Ducain?

REY
I stole it from Unkar Plutt. He
stole it from the Irving Boys, who
stole it from Ducain.

HAN
Who stole it from me! Well, you
tell him Han Solo just stole back
the Millennium Falcon for good.
Han walks away, takes in the ship: it's his again. Doesn't
see that Rey is awed. His back to all of them, he smiles.
Chewie responds as Han heads toward the cockpit.

REY
This is the Millennium Falcon? You're
Han Solo?







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HAN
I used to be.

FINN
Han Solo? The Rebellion General?

REY
No, the smuggler!

FINN

(TO CHEWIE)
Wasn't he a war hero?!
Chewie replies: "Yeah, I guess, kinda..." Rey calls out:

REY
This is the ship that made the Kessel
Run in fourteen parsecs...!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - SAME

Han enters the cockpit.

HAN
Twelve! Fourteen.
A moment of private joy. Then he sees something that ANNOYS

HIM:

HAN (CONT'D)
Hey! Some moof-milker put a
compressor on the ignition line!
Han moves to the corridor.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY


REY
Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was a
mistake too, puts too much stress on

THE HYPERDRIVE--

HAN

(OVERLAPPING HER)
-- Stress on the hyperdrive--
(who is she? Then:)
Chewie, throw 'em in a pod, we'll
drop them at the nearest inhabited
planet.

REY
Wait! No -- we need your help!

HAN
My help?

REY
This droid has to get to the
Resistance base as soon as possible!





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker.
Yup: Han stops in his tracks.

FINN (CONT'D)
You are the Han Solo that fought
with the Rebellion. You knew him.
The mention of Luke has really hit Han. He turns to Finn.

HAN
Yeah, I knew him. I knew Luke.
Suddenly: a distant, METALLIC KA-CHUNK!

HAN (CONT'D)
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten

LOOSE--
Han hurries out -- they all follow, (Chewie, Rey, Finn, then
BB-8), Finn with WILD CONCERN:

FINN
Wait -- a what?! Did you just say
Rathtars? Hey!

INT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY

The Falcon is parked in this giant freighter's hangar. Han
moves to a CONTROL PANEL, they all follow him.

FINN
You're not hauling Rathtars on this
freighter, are you?

HAN
I'm hauling Rathtars.
On the CONTROL PANEL: IMAGES ON SCREENS FROM ALL AROUND THE
SHIP. Including the EXTERIOR, where a TRANSPORT SHIP is
LANDING ON THE FREIGHTER. Han is fearful.

HAN (CONT'D)
Oh great. It's the Guavian Death
Gang -- they must've tracked us from
Nantoon.
Han heads off as:

REY
What's a Rathtar?

INT. CARGO SHIP - CARGO CONTAINER CORRIDOR - DAY

Han leads our group down a LONG NARROW HALL lined with cargo
containers.









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: HAN
They're big and dangerous...

FINN
Y'ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?!

REY
No.

FINN
Good.
They turn a corner:

HAN
I got three of 'em going to King
Prana.

FINN
THREE?! How'd you get them on board?

HAN
I used to have a bigger crew.
Chewie GROAN-TALKS, concurring.

CUT TO: LOOKING UP AS A HATCH OPENS IN THE FLOOR. HAN AND

CO. ARE THERE.

HAN
Get below deck and stay there until
I say so -- don't even think about
taking the Falcon.

REY
What about BB-8?

HAN
He stays with me -- until I get rid
of the gang, then you can have him
back and be on your way.

FINN
What about the Rathtars... where are
you keeping them?
A TERRIFYING BAM: a GROTESQUE RATHTAR GIANT TONGUE SLAMS
into the CARGO CONTAINER window behind Finn, whose heart
stops.

HAN
There's one.

REY
What are you gonna do?

HAN
Same thing I always do: talk my way
out of it.

(CHEWIE MOAN-TALKS)
Yes, I do. Every time.

INT. CARGO SHIP - NARROW CORRIDOR - DAY

A PORTAL opens. The GUAVIAN DEATH GANG enters. One man in
a SUIT (BALA-TIK), and five SECURITY SOLDIERS in badass
UNIFORMS with ROUND-FACE HELMETS. They turn into and stop
at one end of the corridor. Han, Chewie and BB-8 forty feet
away in the middle of the long hall.

BALA-TIK
Han Solo. You are a dead man.
Han smiles innocently, friendly. BB-8 nervously looks back
and forth at the gang, and Han.

HAN
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

BALA-TIK
The problem is we loaned you fifty
thousand for this job.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY

They look up, trying to get a view.

REY
Can you see them?

FINN
No.
They start crawling down the crawl space.

BALA-TIK
I heard you also borrowed fifty
thousand from Kanjiklub.

HAN
You know you can't trust those little
freaks! How long've we known each
other?
Rey and Finn arrive under the gang. They WHISPER:

REY
They have blasters...

FINN
A lot of 'em.
We RISE THROUGH THE FLOOR to see the GANG and Han and company
in the distance.

BALA-TIK
The question is how much longer will
we know each other? Not long. We
want our money back now.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HAN
Ya think hunting Rathtars is cheap?
I spent that money.

BALA-TIK
Kanjiklub wants their investment
back, too.

HAN
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

BALA-TIK
Tell that to Kanjiklub.
The SOUND of a PORTAL OPENING. Han's face GOES WHITE as he
turns to the OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR, where KANJIKLUB
MEMBERS APPEAR. A GANG in a MEDIEVAL BANDITO style.
Han smiles uncomfortably at the Kanjiklub members. Its
LEADER, TASU LEECH, out front. Han tries to play it off:

HAN
Tasu Leech. Good to see you.
Tasu speaks an alien language, we SUBTITLE:

TASU LEECH
Wrong again, Solo. It's over for
you.
Tasu COCKS HIS WEAPON, there for blood. BB-8 is nervous.
Finn and Rey react to the sounds of the new gang -- start
CRAWLING BACK the other way to see them.

HAN
Boys. You're both gonna get
what I promised! Have I ever
not delivered for you before?

BALA-TIK
Yeah.

TASU LEECH
Twice!
Han realizes he's right.

HAN
What was the second time?

BALA-TIK
Your game is old. There's no one in
the galaxy left for you to swindle.

TASU LEECH
Nowhere left for you to hide.







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

BALA-TIK
That BB unit... the First Order is
looking for one just like it. And
two fugitives.
Finn and Rey SUDDENLY STOP CRAWLING, tense.
BB-8 hides behind Han's leg. PUSH IN ON Han as he realizes:
Finn and Rey are in real trouble.

HAN
First I've heard of it.
Below the grating, Finn and Rey look at each other, afraid.
Above, another Kanjiklubber (RAZOO QIN-FEE) says (SUBTITLED):

RAZOO QIN-FEE
Search the freighter.
One of the Kanjiklubbers begins moving down the corridor,
AIMING A FLASHLIGHT DOWN BELOW, searching for:
FINN AND REY, in a QUIET PANIC BELOW: THEY START CRAWLING
FAST in the opposite direction they came.
Rey crawls off fast, Finn follows. They quickly arrive at
a JUNCTION BOX AREA, Rey looking at the controls.

REY
Wait wait wait wait. If we close
the blast doors in that corridor, we
can trap both gangs!

FINN
Close the blast doors from here?

REY
Resetting the fuses should do it.
Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as
they do. Finn quickly joins in.
Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles
optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too.
DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a
GIANT RATHTAR -- an ENORMOUS, FIERCE AND RAVENOUS LAND OCTOPUS --

SLITHERS OUT OF ITS CAGE!
BACK UP TOP as BANKS OF LIGHTS BEGIN GOING OFF, ONE BY ONE.
The GANGS look around.
Han's eyes go wide -- he gets it -- and it's bad. QUIETLY:

HAN
... I got a bad feeling about this...
Suddenly all the LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN -- even down below,
where Rey realizes it hasn't gone as planned.

REY
Oh no.

FINN
Oh no, what?

REY

(PALE)
Wrong fuses.

IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR, BACK WITH THE GANGS:

BALA-TIK
Kill them! And take the droid!
The gangs AIM THEIR WEAPONS JUST AS A RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND

THE GUAVIAN DEATH GANG, GRABBING TWO MEMBERS! THE OTHERS
SCREAM AND RUN! The gang FIRES BACK -- BLASTS FLY!
Han and Chewie react, flinching -- then turn to Kanjiklub as
a RATHTAR APPEARS BEHIND THEM, ROARING DEAFENINGLY! The
Gang turns -- others run, FIRE AT IT.

INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY

Han, Chewie and BB-8 race down the hall -- A MEMBER OF THE
KANJIKLUB GANG comes around the corner. Han PUNCHES him
with one blow, throws him toward the Rathtar. They keep
steppin....

INT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY

Rey and Finn hurriedly crawl through the space below decks.

FINN
This was a mistake!

REY
Huge!

INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY

Two Guavian Death Gang members run through the ship -- passing
Tasu Leech, who sees another Kanjiklub member down the
corridor -- who gets GRABBED BY A TENTACLE! Tasu tries to
help him, but he gets PULLED UP AND AWAY! Tasu hears a
distant terror-scream of a Rathtar, and runs the other way.
Other Kanjiklub members YELL at him to avoid that direction --
they all turn a corner -- a RATHTAR IS THERE AND GRABS THE
TWO OTHERS! Tasu FIRES at the beast and RUNS OFF -- and we
land on a FLOOR HATCH, which opens. Rey and Finn climb out,
quickly.


They turn a corridor --

REY
What do they look like?



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Another corner -- and GANG MEMBERS ARE BATTLING A HORRIBLE
RATHTAR! Rey COVERS HER MOUTH.

FINN
They look like that.
Finn yanks her away. They race around another corner -- a

RATHTAR IS THERE!

FINN (CONT'D)
This way!

REY
Are you sure?
They scream and run off -- but Finn is GRABBED, PULLED AWAY

FAST!

REY (CONT'D)

FINN!
But the Rathtar's fast and TURNS A CORNER, losing Rey --

FINN

REY!

INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR E - DAY

TIGHT ON FINN as he's being yanked down the hall, SCREAMING
as he struggles to get loose!
Rey turns the corner -- Finn is gone -- nowhere to be seen.

REY

FINN!!!!
Without Finn, she is instantly distraught -- then she
realizes: SHE'S JUST PASSED A CONTROL PANEL! Her eyes light
up as she moves to it: a BANK OF VIDEO MONITORS OF THE SHIP --
and there's Finn, being dragged by a Rathtar toward an OPEN
BLAST DOOR. Rey's hand on the button, she waits... then

SLAMS THE BUTTON!

INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR B - DAY

The BLAST DOOR INSTANTLY CLOSES ON ONE OF THE RATHTAR'S
TENTACLES! It SCREAMS IN PAIN, ITS SEVERED TENTACLE STILL
WRAPPED AROUND FINN'S LEG! Finn scrambles up, desperately
shaking the sticky tentacle off his leg!
Rey arrives, runs to Finn, beaming to see him alive -- he is
adrenaline-rushed, in shock:

REY
Finn!

FINN
It had me! But the door--!





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY
That was lucky!
ANOTHER CORRIDOR - Finn and Rey run towards the Falcon.

INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR D - DAY

Han, Chewie and BB-8 take cover, Han exchanging BLASTER FIRE
with GANG MEMBERS AT THE OTHER END OF THE HALL.

HAN
I got the door. Cover us!
Chewie GROAN-AGREES. Chewie FIRES DOWN THE HALL as Han
CROSSES THE CORRIDOR, BB-8 following nervously. As Chewie
exchanges blaster fire, Han works the controls.
THE HATCH OPENS (FALCON in the distance) -- just as CHEWIE
IS HIT IN THE SHOULDER BY ENEMY FIRE! He goes down with a

LOUD GROAN!

HAN (CONT'D)
Chewie! You okay?
Han GRABS CHEWIE'S BOWCASTER, FIRES at the DOOR CONTROLS,

BADASS!

HAN (CONT'D)
(looks at bowcaster)
Wow. Come on! Come on!

INT. CARGO SHIP HANGAR - DAY

Run with Finn and Rey as they turn into the hangar, toward
the Falcon. Han helps WOUNDED CHEWIE up the ramp, sees them.

REY
Han!
Finn and Rey race past BB-8 -- as they go up the ramp, Han
says to Rey:

HAN
You, close the door behind us!

(TO FINN)
You take care of Chewie!
Han and Rey race up the ramp as Finn heads up with Chewie,
who SCREAMS WILDLY IN PAIN!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Han stands at the navicomputer, hitting switches. Rey enters
fast, moves past him to Chewie's seat.

HAN
Hey, where are you going?









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump
too -- if we don't prime that we're
not going anywhere.

HAN
I hate that guy.
Han sits as, Rey hitting buttons:

REY
And you could use a co-pilot.

HAN
I got one, he's back there.

IN THE LOUNGE, CHEWIE IS IN PAIN --

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Han and Rey in the seats:

HAN
Watch the thrust, we're goin' out of
here at lightspeed --

REY

(SHOCKED)
From inside the hangar? Is that
even possible?

HAN
I never ask that question until after
I've done it.
A RATHTAR JUMPS ONTO THE WINDSHIELD -- REY SCREAMS! Its
GIANT MOUTH CHEWING AT THE GLASS! Han works the controls:

HAN (CONT'D)
This is not how I thought this day
was gonna go -- angle the shields --
Hang on back there!
IN THE LOUNGE, Chewie is in pain -- Finn going through a
first aid kit -- the ship is HIT again --

FINN

(HUGE PROBLEM)
No problem!

INT. CARGO SHIP - HANGAR - DAY

Three GANG MEMBERS race out here and FIRE AT THE FALCON --
hitting FUEL LINES, BLASTING THE SHIP HARD!
The ship is hit.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY


HAN
Come on baby, don't let me down!
He hits a switch -- but NOTHING.

HAN (CONT'D)
What?!
But Rey reaches over, hits a switch, matter-of-factly.

REY
Compressor.
Han doesn't like it but she's right -- he hits the switch
again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES! The hangar is FILLED WITH
LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the ATTACKING GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED
BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES. In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY
as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we CUT TO:

EXT. CARGO SHIP - DAY

Camera ROTATES as the Falcon DISAPPEARS IN A STREAK, leaving
the cargo ship behind.

INT. CARGO SHIP - DAY

PUSH IN on a HANGAR DOOR where Bala-Tik arrives at the window,
SEETHING. Makes a CALL:

BALA-TIK
Inform the First Order that Han Solo
has the droid they want. And it's
aboard the Millennium Falcon.

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

A pair of TIE fighters roar towards a magnificent PLANET,
frozen WHITE. This is the STARKILLER BASE, a natural planet
that has been hacked and modified into something sinister.
Over this we HEAR a DEEP, almost SOOTHING VOICE. A voice
very much in control, of power:

SNOKE (V.O.)
The droid will soon be delivered to
the Resistance...

INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

KYLO REN and General Hux in a dark space, looking UPWARD at
someone addressing them.
We're in a massive and dark ASSEMBLY ROOM. Hundreds of DESKS
in a stadium arc, focused on a platform where we see SUPREME
LEADER SNOKE. Not entirely human, at nearly twenty-five
feet tall. All of him a STONY GREY. Old, wounded, fragile
and powerful, all at the same time.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

SNOKE
... Leading them to the last Jedi.
If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi
will rise.

GENERAL HUX
Supreme Leader, I take full
responsibility for th--

SNOKE
General! Our strategy must now
change.

GENERAL HUX
The weapon. It is ready. I believe
the time has come to use it. We
shall destroy the government that
supports the Resistance, the Republic.
Without their friends to protect
them, the Resistance will be
vulnerable, and we will stop them
before they reach Skywalker.
Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then:

SNOKE
Go. Oversee preparations.

GENERAL HUX
Yes, Supreme Leader.
General Hux, proud, cocksure, exits. Kylo Ren watches him
go. Snoke SITS. A new intimacy in his voice.

SNOKE
There's been an awakening. Have you
felt it?

KYLO REN
Yes.

SNOKE
There's something more. The droid
we seek is aboard the Millennium
Falcon. In the hands of your father,
Han Solo.
Kylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise.

KYLO REN
He means nothing to me.

SNOKE
Even you, master of the Knights of
Ren, have never faced such a test.









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

KYLO REN

(STEELY RESOLVE)
By the grace of your training, I
will not be seduced.

SNOKE
We shall see. We shall see.
A gentle, satisfied nod from Snoke, and Kylo Ren, obsessed,
filled up, exits. Snoke watches him disappear, a grotesque
evil SMILE growing -- as he DISINTEGRATES -- Snoke has been
a HOLOGRAM all along.

EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE - DAY

RACING with the Falcon through the STRINGLIGHT of lightspeed.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

CHAOS: INTERCUT between the COCKPIT where Han and Rey pilot,
ALARMS SOUNDING, problems everywhere, and the LOUNGE where
CHEWIE YELPS as Finn nervously works to BANDAGE HIS SHOULDER.

SPARKS!

HAN
Electrical overload!

REY
I can fix that!

HAN
The coolant's leaking!

REY
Try transferring auxiliary power to
the secondary tank--

HAN
-- Secondary tank, I got it!

INT. LOUNGE:

CHEWIE HOWLS IN PAIN! Finn hangs in there, wraps a bandage
on Chewie's shoulder: Chewie ROARS. BB-8 scurries off.

FINN
Chewie, come on! I need help with
this giant hairy thing! Stop moving!
Chewie!

INT. FALCON COCKPIT:


HAN
You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal
with me!

INT. LOUNGE:

As Finn struggles to bandage the Wookiee:

FINN
Hurt him?! He almost killed me six
times!
(Chewie GRABS HIM by
the collar, ROARS)
Which is fine.

INT. FALCON COCKPIT:


HAN
This hyperdrive blows there's gonna
be pieces of us in three different
systems.
Han at the controls when all the alarms STOP. Rey, satisfied,
sits in the co-pilot seat. Han is confused.

HAN (CONT'D)
What'd you do?

REY
I by-passed the compressor.
He looks at her. A little, appreciative laugh. Han exits,
walking past BB-8.

HAN
Move, Ball.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY

Han kneels at Chewie, who lies awake but recovering. Han
checks his friend's wound with care. Chewie MOAN-TALKS.

HAN
Nah, don't say that, you did great.
Just rest.
Han turns to Finn, who sits at the HOLOCHESS set, BB-8 beside
him. This is awkward for Han, but damn, he means it:

HAN (CONT'D)
Good job, kid. And thanks.

FINN
You're welcome.
Finn has accidentally hit a button on the chess set, and the
PIECES appear, looking up at Finn, curiously. The pieces
start to FIGHT as Finn fiddles with the controls, trying to
turn it off.

HAN
So, fugitives, huh?

REY
The First Order wants the map.

(MORE)

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY (CONT'D)
(re: Finn and BB-8)
Finn is with the Resistance...

(SHRUGS)
... I'm just a scavenger.
Han gives Finn a skeptical once-over as Finn finally manages
to TURN THE CHESS SET OFF as Rey enters. Han looks to BB-8.

HAN
Let's see whatcha got.

REY

(TO BB-8)
Go ahead.
BB-8 rolls forward -- and suddenly PROJECTS A HOLOGRAPHIC

MAP, FILLING THE ROOM. PLANETS, STARS, SYSTEMS.
They all react. Chewie sits to look up. Han moves through
stars, becomes reflective.

HAN
This map's not complete. It's just
a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared,
people have been looking for him.

REY
Why'd he leave?

HAN
He was training a new generation of
Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned
against him, destroyed it all. Luke
felt responsible... He walked away
from everything.

FINN
Do you know what happened to him?

HAN
There're a lot of rumors. Stories.
The people who knew him the best
think he went looking for the first
Jedi temple.

REY
The Jedi were real?

HAN
I used to wonder that myself. Thought
it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo --
magical power holding together good,
evil, the dark side and the light.

(BEAT)
'Crazy thing is, it's true. The
Force, the Jedi, all of it. It's
all true.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
An alarm rings on the control station, prompting Han to toggle
some switches. BB-8 cuts off the hologram. Chewie rises
and moans to Han, but Han motions for Chewie to lay back

DOWN:

HAN (CONT'D)
No, you rest.
(To Rey and Finn)
You want my help? You're getting
it. Gonna see an old friend. She'll
get your droid home. This is our
stop.
Han leaves towards the cockpit, Rey and Finn following.

EXT. LIGHTSPEED TO SPACE - DAY

BEHIND THE FALCON as it DROPS OUT OF LIGHTSPEED, revealing a
BEAUTIFUL GREEN PLANET ahead, TAKODANA.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Han pilots. Finn and BB-8 beside him, Rey as co-pilot.
Han notices Rey looking out the windshield, almost in tears.

REY

(QUIETLY)
... I didn't know there was this
much green in the whole galaxy...
Han watches her -- sees a vulnerability that touches him.

EXT. TAKODANA PLANET - DAY

The Falcon CRESTS OVER an ENDLESS GREEN FOREST TO REVEAL a
CASTLE on a picturesque LAKE.
The Falcon lands near the castle, among dozens of WORN,
smallish freighters.

EXT. LANDING PAD - NEAR MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

Rey steps off the Falcon, UP TO CAMERA, BB-8 at her side.
She takes in the towering stone CASTLE, FOREST to one side,
LAKE to the other. Serene, beautiful, all new to her.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY

From BLACKNESS: a storage unit opens. Han rummages,
retrieving old BLASTERS. Finn arrives behind him, concerned.

FINN
Hey, Solo -- I'm not sure what we're
walking into here --

HAN
D'you just call me "Solo"?





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN
Sorry. Han-- Mr. Solo. You should
know, I'm a big deal in the
Resistance. Which puts a real target
on my back. Are there any
conspirators here? First Order
sympathizers?

HAN
Listen big deal, you've got another
problem. Women always figure out
the truth.
Hands him a BLASTER.

HAN (CONT'D)
Always.
Han walks off. Finn watches him go, wracked with guilt.

EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

Han hands Rey a blaster pistol as she stands at looks at the
castle.

HAN
You might need this.

REY
I think I can handle myself.

HAN
I know you do. That's why I'm giving
it to you. Take it.
Rey picks it up. Grips it.

HAN (CONT'D)
You know how to use one of these?

REY
Yeah, you pull the trigger.

HAN
There's a little bit more to it than
that. You got a lot to learn. You
got a name?

REY
Rey.

HAN
Rey. I've been thinkin' about
bringing on some more crew, Rey. A
second mate. Someone to help out.
Someone who can keep up with Chewie
and me, appreciates the Falcon.







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

REY
Are you offering me a job?

HAN
I wouldn't be nice to you. It doesn't
pay much.

REY
You're offering me a job.

HAN
I'm thinking about it.
Rey wants to say yes. But something stops her. A line she
can't cross.

HAN (CONT'D)
Well?

REY
If you were, I'd be flattered. But
I have to get home.
Han looks at her, questioningly.

HAN
Jakku?
Rey looks off, in thought. Yeah, Jakku.

REY

(BEAT)
I've already been away too long.

HAN

(TO CHEWIE)
Chewie, check out the ship as best
you can.

HAN (CONT'D)
It's too bad. Chewie kind of likes
you.
Han heads off. HOLD on Rey.

EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

Han walks them to the castle.

FINN
Solo, why are we here again?

HAN
To get your droid on a clean ship.

REY
Clean?







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HAN
Do you think it was luck that Chewie
and I found the Falcon? If we can
find it on our scanners, the First
Order's not far behind. Want to get
BB-8 to the Resistance? Maz Kanata
is our best bet.

FINN
We can trust her, right?

HAN
Relax, kid. She's run this watering
hole for a thousand years. Maz is a
bit of an acquired taste, so let me
do the talking. And whatever you
do, don't stare...

REY AND FINN
At what?

HAN
Any of it.
The door opens. Music. Madness. And...

INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - MAIN ROOM - DAY

We ENTER THE LOUD, CROWDED MESS of a hall -- PUSHING PAST a
room full of rough and odd ALIENS AND HUMANS, who gamble,
drink, scheme, negotiate, argue -- until we end up on the
BACK of a tiny, thousand year-old, four foot tall ALIEN, who
suddenly STARTS, as if SENSING something -- the Alien TURNS
TO US: she is FEMALE, wearing large ADJUSTABLE GOGGLES.
This is MAZ KANATA.

MAZ
Han Solo!
Everyone turns to look. It's ALL QUIET in here.

HAN
(Sotto) Oh boy. (Louder, waving)
Hey, Maz!
NOISE returns. Maz walks to them, pushes someone away.

MAZ
Where's my boyfriend?

HAN
Chewie's working on the Falcon.

MAZ
I like that Wookiee. I assume you
need something. Desperately. Let's
get to it.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Maz walks off, gesturing for them to follow. Finn and Rey
are confused. Han indicates for them to follow. They do --
passing the enormous GRUMMGAR, who sits with vixen BAZINE
NETAL, who watches them suspiciously.
A SMALL DROID (GA-97), who turns its head to see BB-8
following Rey across the room. GA-97, now animated, makes a
small TRANSMITTING SOUND, which is subtitled.

GA-97
Alert the Resistance. Their missing
droid is here!
And we CUT TO:

IN A DARK ALCOVE - MOMENTS LATER
Bazine enters a shadowy space, stealthily makes a call on a
communicator. Clearly, BAZINE IS A SPY. Subtitled:

BAZINE
Inform the First Order... I've found
the droid.

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

A massive Star Destroyer hovers over the hacked ice planet.

INT. STAR DESTROYER - KYLO REN'S CHAMBERS - DAY

A dark space. Kylo Ren, CLOSE TO CAMERA, addresses someone
OFF-CAMERA whom we do not see.

KYLO REN
Forgive me. I feel it again. The
pull to the light. Supreme Leader
senses it. Show me again, the power
of the darkness, and I will let
nothing stand in our way. Show me,
Grandfather, and I will finish what
you started.
As his emotion builds, he stands and heads off -- we FOLLOW
HIM, PIVOTING TO REVEAL who he was talking to: THE BURNT,

ASHEN, GHOSTLY DEFORMED MASK OF DARTH VADER.

CUT TO:

INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - TABLE - DAY

Maz is putting together some FOOD as she says:

MAZ
A map to Skywalker himself? You're
right back in the mess.

HAN
Maz, I need you to get this droid to
Leia.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

MAZ
Hmm. No. You've been running away
from this fight for too long. Han,
nyakee nago wadda. Go home!

HAN
Leia doesn't want to see me.

FINN
Please, we came here for your help.

REY
What fight?

MAZ
The only fight: against the dark
side. Through the ages, I've seen
evil take many forms. The Sith.
The Empire. Today, it is the First
Order. Their shadow is spreading
across the galaxy. We must face
them. Fight them. All of us.

FINN
There is no fight against the First
Order! Not one we can win. Look
around. There's no chance we haven't
been recognized already. I bet you
the First Order is on their way right--
Finn stops, seeing Maz adjusting her goggles, scrutinizing
him -- her eyes get HUGE.

FINN (CONT'D)
What's this? What are you doing?
Maz adjusts the goggles again. Her eyes get impossibly
BIGGER. She grunts recognition. She hoists herself on the
tabletop, knocking over food and plates, crawling towards
Finn.

FINN (CONT'D)
Solo, what is she doing?

HAN
I don't know, but it ain't good.

MAZ
If you live long enough you see the
same eyes in different people. I'm
looking at the eyes of a man who
wants to run.

FINN
(eyes on Maz)
You don't know a thing about me.
Where I'm from. What I've seen.

(MORE)





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN (CONT'D)
You don't know the First Order like
I do. They'll slaughter us. We all
need to run.
Rey is stunned. Maz, not so much. She crawls back to her
chair. She points to some pirates in the corner.

MAZ
You see those two? They'll trade
work for transportation to the Outer
Rim. There, you can disappear.
Finn sees them. Considers.

REY
Finn!

FINN
Come with me.

REY
What about BB-8? We're not done
yet. We have to get him back to
your base.

FINN
I can't.
Finn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han.

HAN
Keep it, kid.
Finn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses
back to normal, and turns to Han.

MAZ
Who's the girl?

ON FINN
Who has arrived at the table with the ALIEN SMUGGLERS.

FINN
I was told you could get me to the
Outer Rim.
Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting.

REY
What are you doing?
Finn gets up to talk to her.

FINN
(to Big Head)
Don't leave without me.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Embarrassed, Finn moves her away.

REY
You can't just go. I won't let you.

FINN
I'm not who you think I am.

REY
Finn, what are you talking about?

FINN
I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero.
I'm a Stormtrooper.

(STOPS HER)
Like all of them, I was taken from a
family I'll never know. And raised
to do one thing...

(EMOTIONAL)
But my first battle, I made a choice.
I wasn't going to kill for them. So
I ran.

FINN (CONT'D)
Right into you. And you looked at
me like no one ever had. I was
ashamed of what I was. But I'm done
with the First Order. I'm never
going back. Rey, come with me.

REY
Don't go.

FINN
Take care of yourself. Please.
Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey
watches Finn return to the aliens...
And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks
through it.
Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a
young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into
the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked
back at her one last time.

INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

Rey steps down into the basement corridor. BB-8 follows
her. Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why
she's down here. She can hear the echoing sounds of a young
girl crying. She heads down the hall... to the very end,
where there is a door. It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION
draws her closer. She looks at the door lock -- AND THE

DOOR OPENS.
Hesitant, Rey enters.

INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY

Rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. Old
treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something
specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX.
She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside
the box has been calling her here. BB-8 nervously follows.
Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. A moment
heavy with tension.
Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original
lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but
she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there
is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves
her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound.
The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her
something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD
CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air.

YOUNG GIRL

NO!
She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and
hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY.
We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all
TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the
WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS.
She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT
NIGHT. We PAN to:
R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE,
whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches
out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND.
We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT --
and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP --
To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A
FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we
FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime
battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what she
sees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six
other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him!
Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and
SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT --
and see...
A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical.
Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku,
watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her.

YOUNG GIRL
No, come back!





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

UNKAR PLUTT
Quiet, girl!
The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely
eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around
her to see she is..
In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind,
confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath
seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING
LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound.
Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND
A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN:

INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

She falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the
hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed.
She HEARS something and turns to look.
Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has
just happened.

REY
What was that? I shouldn't have
gone in there.

MAZ
That lightsaber was Luke's. And his
father's before him and now, it calls
to you!
Rey stands, fast. Still overwhelmed, emotional, speechless.

REY
I have to get back to Jakku.

MAZ
Han told me.
(reaches out, hold

REY'S HAND)
Dear child. I see your eyes. You
already know the truth. Whomever
you're waiting for on Jakku, they're
never coming back. But... there's
someone who still could.

REY
Luke.

MAZ
The belonging you seek is not behind
you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi,
but I know the Force. It moves
through and surrounds every living
thing. Close your eyes. Feel it.

(MORE)



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

MAZ (CONT'D)
The light. It's always been there.
It will guide you. The saber. Take
it.
Rey suddenly stands.

REY
I'm never touching that again. I
don't want any part of this.
And Rey runs off, passing Maz.
Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and
heads off, fast. BB-8 follows her. TIGHT ON MAZ, watching
her go. Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl.

EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

Rey exits the castle, needs to run, but doesn't know where.
Heads toward the woods.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Rey moves through the foliage, heart racing. Over this, we
HEAR a RUMBLING -- intense, an OMEN of something horrible to
come.

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY

A massive rally: a thousand STORMTROOPERS, TIE FIGHTERS,
OFFICERS and VEHICLES. BRUTALIST STRUCTURES, mountainous
SNOWY LANDSCAPE. Addressing them at a podium, flanked by
RED FIRST ORDER BANNERS, is HUX. His voice ECHOES:

GENERAL HUX
Today is the end of the Republic!
The end of a regime that acquiesces
to disorder! At this very moment,
in a system far from here the New
Republic LIES to the GALAXY while
secretly supporting the treachery of
the loathsome Resistance. This fierce
machine which you have built, upon
which we stand, will bring an end to
the Senate! To their cherished fleet!
All remaining systems will bow to
the First Order! And will remember
this... as the last day of the
Republic!



INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

ENGINEERS perform FINAL FIRING PROTOCOL. There's a sense of
nervousness -- WILL THIS MASSIVE WEAPON ACTUALLY WORK?

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY


GENERAL HUX

FIRE!
And Hux TURNS to give the signal as we CUT BACK WIDE -- a
ROAR OF BOOTS ON PAVEMENT as the thousand Stormtroopers TURN
to face an endless snowy landscape. WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?!

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

A view PAST THE RALLY. For a moment, nothing. Then, eerily

SILENT, AN IMPOSSIBLE BLAST OF FIRE LIGHT -- LIKE AN ATOMIC

BOMB TEST TIMES A ZILLION -- BLASTS FROM MILES AWAY, INTO
THE SKY! Seconds later, a TERRIBLE EXPLOSIVE ROAR!
The Troopers -- everyone -- is nearly PUSHED BACK by the
FORCE of it -- the magnitude! Many have to COVER THEIR EYES!
For MILES around the FIREBEAM, ICE AND SNOW MELTS INSTANTLY!
Runoff tunnels FLOODED with AN OCEAN OF FRESH WATER. AIRBORNE
CREATURES by the thousands burst from trees and take flight.
Hux watches, his eyes WILD WITH POWER AND EVIL. From HIS
eyes, CUT TO:

INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY

TIGHT ON KYLO REN as he watches the Starkiller firing.

EXT. MAZ' CASTLE - DAY

Finn boards the Alien Freighter. The SOUND FROM THE SKY
makes him turn back. He sees the PATH OF FIRE and his blood
runs cold, his heart sinks.

EXT. REPUBLIC SYSTEM - NIGHT

At a massive distance we see PLANETS THE REPUBLIC CAPITAL

SYSTEM -- INCREASINGLY LIT, THEN POWERFULLY HIT BY THE VAST

FIREBLAST WHICH OBLITERATES IT ALL!

EXT. REPUBLIC CITY - NIGHT

The galaxy CENTER OF GOVERNMENT at NIGHT. Impressive
structures. Senators and dignitaries look in uncomprehending
horror to the night sky. LIGHT GROWING --
FROM A GREAT DISTANCE a CIRCLE OF FIRE -- LIKE A SMALL SUN

APPEARING FROM NOWHERE AND GROWING CLOSE AND MASSIVE, TURNING
NIGHT TO DAY! And in seconds THE FIRE BLOCKS OUT EVERYTHING

ELSE, AND THE ENTIRE PLANET OF HOSNIAN PRIME IS INCINERATED!

EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

A crowd of ALIENS files out from inside, all eyes on the
FIRE IN THE SKY. Dozens of LANGUAGES exclaiming fear and
horror. Find Han and Chewie moving out, looking up.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN (O.S.)
It was the Republic.
Han and Chewie turn as Finn arrives, moving quickly through
the crowd. With dread:

FINN (CONT'D)
The First Order, they've done it.
Where's Rey?

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Rey races through the forest and finally comes to a stop,
overwhelmed and exhausted. At an emotional breaking point,
she has no idea where to go, who to turn to. Then she HEARS
A BEEP -- turns to see BB-8, catching up with her.

REY
What are you doing?

(HE BEEPS)
You have to go back.
(he BEEPS again)

REY (CONT'D)
BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to
go back, you're too important.
They'll help you.
Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in
front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS
ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER

FRIENDS ARE IN DANGER!

INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

Maz leads Han, Finn and Chewie down the hall, fast:

MAZ
I've had this for ages...

MAZ'S CASTLE - TREASURE ROOM - DAY
Maz opens the box -- holds out the lightsaber to Finn:

MAZ
Kept it locked away.

HAN
Where'd you get that?

MAZ
A good question for another time.

(TO FINN)
Take it! Find your friend!
Finn grabs it as the room is SHAKEN by an above ground attack.

MAZ (CONT'D)
Those beasts! They're here!

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Rey and BB-8 race fast back toward the castle -- EXPLOSION
SOUNDS can be HEARD from the direction they're headed!

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Rey races through the trees -- sees Maz' castle -- BEING
DESTROYED BY FIRST ORDER SHIPS! Aliens RUNNING, GETTING
OBLITERATED by SCREAMING TIE FIGHTERS! Other TIE FIGHTERS
and TRANSPORTERS LAND, STORMTROOPERS in attack.
Just then, filtered RADIO CALLS get Rey's attention: nearby
STORMTROOPERS have spotted her, AND FIRE!

STORMTROOPER
FN-417, hold position!
Rey takes cover, grabs her BLASTER -- but IT WON'T FIRE!
She panics, then realizes:

REY
Safety!
SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS
and retreats, calls to BB-8:
BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more
chasing Troopers!

EXT. MAZ' CASTLE RUINS - DAY

Kylo Ren moves through the DEBRIS. A Stormtrooper approaches:

STORMTROOPER  4
Sir, the droid was spotted heading
west, with a girl.
Kylo Ren LOOKS BACK SHARPLY, in Rey's direction --

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Rey and BB-8 move swiftly, terrified -- she stops them:

REY
You have to keep going, stay out of
sight, I'll try to fight 'em off.
(BB-8 BEEPS; bravely
through her fear)
I hope so, too.
BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind
a massive, mossy tree. TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE --

EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY

Han, Chewie, Finn and Maz, exhausted, CLIMB UP, peek through
debris.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HAN
Come on, Chewie!
Maz turns to Finn:

MAZ
Rey and BB-8, they need you. Now
go.

FINN
I need a weapon.
Maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER.

MAZ
You have one!
He looks at her questioningly -- he's supposed to use the
lightsaber?! He TURNS IT ON.
HAN AND CHEWIE RUN, TAKE COVER from BLASTS, FIRING BACK at
Stormtroopers, taking some out!

HAN
Hey, can I try that?
Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers
and sends them flying.

HAN (CONT'D)

(TO CHEWBACCA)
I like this thing.
FINN SURPRISES A STORMTROOPER WITH THE LIGHTSABER, then
another! Untrained, he's athletic, brave, impressive. One
Stormtrooper has a MACE --

STORMTROOPER
Traitor!
FINN and the TROOPER WITH THE MACE battle. The Mace Trooper
KNOCKS FINN DOWN! The Stormtrooper is about to end him,
when THE STORMTROOPER IS SHOT AND FALLS!
Wide-eyed Finn sees Han run over, having fired the blast!
Han helps him up.

HAN
You okay, Big deal?



FINN
Thanks!
But TEN STORMTROOPERS come over a RISE, BLASTERS AIMED.

STORMTROOPER
Don't move! TK-338, we have targets
in custody!



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
No way out, they DROP THEIR WEAPONS: TIGHT on the LIGHTSABER
as it HITS THE GROUND. A STORMTROOPER HAND picks it up.
Han's MIND RACES as a SQUAD OF TROOPERS appears behind them.
Finn, Han and Chewie are MARCHED by Stormtroopers back toward
a transport, hands on their heads.
But then -- A FAMILIAR ROAR RIPPING ACROSS THE LAKE -- Han
turns -- they all do: coming toward them across the water, X-

WINGS AND RESISTANCE SPACECRAFT APPEAR, BEGIN FIRING AT THE

FIRST ORDER SHIPS!

PUSH IN ON HAN, HOPE SURGING -- CHEWIE TALKS.

STORMTROOPER (CONT'D)
We have incoming at two-eight-point-
six! Move! Dispatch! Move!
Scramble all squads! Repeat, scramble
all squads! Anti-air cover en route
to our position!

HAN
It's the Resistance.
One X-WING in particular -- MARKED IN BLACK -- SWOOPS DOWN
and takes out the parked TIE FIGHTERS and Troopers!

INT. POE'S X-WING - DAY

It's Poe Dameron at the stick of his X-wing.

POE
Go straight ahead and don't let these
dogs scare you!

JESS (V.O.)
Copy that!

SNAP (V.O.)
We're with you, Poe!
The Stormtroopers around Finn, Han and Chewie SCATTER, TOSSED
in EXPLOSIONS! The LIGHTSABER LANDS AGAIN -- FINN PICKS IT

UP.

HAN
Quick!
Chewie picks up his Bowcaster, Han takes the blaster. Shoots
a Trooper.

FINN
Woohoo! YEAH! That's one helluva
pilot!

INT. POE'S X-WING - DAY


POE

WOOHOO!

EXT. FOREST - DAY

In the darkened woods, Rey, terrified, keeps her blaster
aimed. Her eyes dart around for her pursuer.
And then: THE UNIQUE SOUND OF KYLO REN'S RASPING LIGHTSABER
COMING TO LIFE -- A SOUND she's HEARD BEFORE in the FORCEBACK.
Rey's heart skips a beat: she's even more scared now.
Kylo Ren appears from behind a tree -- Rey FIRES again and
again -- Kylo Ren moves toward her, USING HIS LIGHTSABER TO

DEFLECT EVERY BLAST.
She FIRES ferociously, but Kylo Ren keeps coming! His hand
rises -- Rey suddenly STOPS -- GASPS -- UNABLE TO MOVE.

KYLO REN
The girl I've heard so much about.
He walks AROUND HER, slowly, she won't let herself cry.

KYLO REN (CONT'D)
The droid.
He comes around to see her face. After a scary beat he WHIPS

HIS SABER UP TO HER EYES, ILLUMINATING HER FACE.

KYLO REN (CONT'D)
Where is it?

WIDE SHOT: THE EPIC BATTLE BETWEEN RESISTANCE AND FIRST

ORDER TROOPS, REFLECTED IN THE STILL LAKE.

STORMTROOPER
Request air support!

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS SABER, reaches up... and REACHES
TOWARDS REY'S FACE. She can't move, strains in agony. After
a beat, surprised by what he finds, he removes his hand.
She is relieved but still afraid.

KYLO REN
The map. You've seen it.
Rey is horrified. He TOUCHES HER FACE again: the pain, tears
stream. Kylo Ren, taking more from her mind...
She stares at him, TERRIFIED, straining in agony --
Kylo Ren, mid-interrogation, TURNS TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE
EXPLOSIONS. Stormtroopers APPROACH through the woods.

STORMTROOPER  5
Sir, Resistance fighters! We need
more troops.
Kylo Ren TURNS BACK TO Rey, his hand still on her face.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

KYLO REN
Pull the division out. Forget the
droid. We have what we need.
A GESTURE from Kylo Ren and REY LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS, FALLS

FROM FRAME!

EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY

The BLACK-MARKED X-WING SWOOPS DOWN again, FIRING, EXPLODING
another TIE Fighter! On the ground:

STORMTROOPER
Pull back the tree line!
Han and Chewie dodge debris, FIRING and TAKING OUT TROOPERS.
FINN takes out 2 TROOPERS with the blaster, then, out of
breath, turns to see: Kylo Ren in the forest, CARRYING REY
IN HIS ARMS, INTO HIS SHUTTLE! Finn's heart SHATTERS --
Han stops -- turns -- sees Kylo Ren entering his shuttle.
Han is ROCKED.

FINN

NO!! REY!!!
Heroically, Finn runs toward the shuttle through LASER BLASTS
AND EXPLOSIONS, but the shuttle TAKES OFF -- Finn irrationally

CHASES IT, SCREAMS DESPERATELY:

FINN (CONT'D)
No, no, no, no... REY!!
In crazed frustration, Finn stops running, watches the
receding First Order ships, Rey their captive.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

BB-8 moves fast, then stops and looks up as the First Order
ships RETREAT, OFF PLANET. A considered beat, and BB-8 heads

BACK FOR THE CASTLE.

EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY

Post battle. Finn runs to Han:

FINN
He took her! Did you see that? He
took her. She's gone!

HAN

(WALKS PAST)
Yeah, yeah, I know...
And he and Chewie head off.

EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY

Han moves toward a RESISTANCE TRANSPORT landing in the debris.
BB-8 rolls up beside him, in wait for the transport.
ON HAN'S FACE, knowing exactly what's about to happen.
Finally, the transport door opens.
And standing there is LEIA.
She sees Han and is stunned. A silent beat, husband and
wife reunited for the first time in years. In the smoke and
embers, no one says a word.
Then C-3PO walks out from the transport, into the field:

C-3PO
Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See-
Threepio!
(sees Han, stops)
You probably don't recognize me
because of the red arm.
(sees Leia,

INCREASINGLY AWKWARD)
Look who it is! Did you see who?
Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General.
Sorry. Come along, BB-8. Quickly.

(BB-8 BEEPS)
Yes, I must get my proper arm
reinstalled.
He hurries off. Finally, alone again.

HAN
You changed your hair.

LEIA
Same jacket.

HAN
No, new jacket.
Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS
a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship.
It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly:

HAN (CONT'D)
... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son.
He was here.
Leia hears this.
Maz watches through the smoke.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

The FALCON and surviving X-WINGS ROAR past camera toward a

PLANET WITH GREEN FLORA AND A RING OF ASTEROIDS.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
This is D'QAR.

EXT. D'QAR - DAY

The SHIPS DESCENDING among grassy mounds and sunken
structures.

EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

LARGE GRASS MOUNDS cover HANGARS, beneath the odd, giant
trees. BOOM DOWN as RESISTANCE GROUND CREW direct an X-WING
to a LANDING. In the FOREGROUND, another X-wing canopy OPENS,
a PILOT climbs out. PAN TO REVEAL the landed Millennium
Falcon. Finn runs down the ramp, UP TO CAMERA, desperate,
searching.
Then BB-8 SPEEDS RIGHT PAST HIM, almost knocking him down --
Finn watches as BB-8 rolls over to the PILOT GETTING OUT OF
THE BLACK-MARKED X-WING. The Pilot's helmet comes off.

IT IS POE!
Finn can't believe what he's seeing. And Poe, kneeling in
WARM REUNION with BB-8, listens and reacts to something the
droid tells him. Poe looks up and sees Finn -- and he can't
believe it either! Poe smiles, points at Finn. From a
distance, Finn gestures in sheer amazement that Poe is alive.

FINN
Poe. Poe Dameron.
They move to each other -- and embrace.

FINN (CONT'D)
You're alive!

POE
So are you!

FINN
What happened to you?

POE
What happened? I got thrown from
the crash, woke up at night -- no
you, no ship, nothing--
BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe listens, turns to Finn.

POE (CONT'D)
BB-8 says that you saved him.

FINN
No, no, no. It wasn't just me.

POE
You completed my mission, Finn.
That's my jacket?





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN
Oh here.

POE
No, no, no. Keep it. It suits you.
You're a good man, Finn.

FINN
Poe -- I need your help.

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

MOVE FAST with Finn and Poe. Finn takes in this makeshift
command center, buried deep among vines and roots. They
arrive at Leia, who stands with a group of Resistance
Officers, including ADMIRALS ACKBAR and STATURA:

POE
General Organa. Sorry to interrupt,
this is Finn, he needs to talk to

YOU --

LEIA
(takes Finn's hand)
And I need to talk to him. That was
incredibly brave, what you did.
Renouncing the First Order, saving
this man's life --

FINN
(surprised she knows)
Thank you, ma'am -- but a friend of
mine was taken prisoner--

LEIA
Han told me about the girl, I'm sorry.
Finn is startled -- Poe jumps in:

POE
Finn's familiar with the weapon that
destroyed the Hosnian system. He
worked on the base.

LEIA
We're desperate for anything you can
tell us.

FINN
That's where my friend was taken --
I've got to get there, fast.

LEIA
And I will do everything I can to
help, but first you must tell us all
you know.

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

Chewbacca sits on a bed in the med bay. DR. KALONIA uses a
device to help heal his shoulder. Chewie TALKS.

DR. KALONIA

(CHEWIE TALKS)
That sounds very scary.

(CHEWIE TALKS)
You must be so brave.
Chewie agrees.

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

C-3PO takes the DATA DEVICE from BB-8 and inserts it into a
BASE COMPUTER. THE PROJECTED MAP APPEARS in HOLOGRAM. Leia
enters, studying it, dispirited. PAN as she moves, REVEALING
HAN. C-3PO is here and some others.

C-3PO
General, I regret to inform you, but
this map recovered from BB-8 is only
partially complete. And even worse,
it matches no charted system on
record. We simply do not have enough
information to locate Master Luke.

LEIA
I can't believe I was so foolish to
think that I could just find Luke
and bring him home.

HAN
Leia...

LEIA
Don't do that.

HAN
Do what?
She heads off.

LEIA
Anything.
Flummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO.

C-3PO
Princesses.
Han follows Leia across the base floor:

HAN
I'm trying to be helpful!









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

LEIA
When did that ever help? And don't
say the Death Star.

HAN

(SIGHS)

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

LOW WITH BB-8 as he rolls over and finds, under a dark and
dusty tarp in a corner, R2-D2. BB-8 BEEPS at R2, pulls off
the tarp and tries to start a conversation. But R2 DOESN'T
RESPOND AT ALL. BB-8 tries again. Nothing. BB-8 NUDGES
R2. Nothing. Then:

C-3PO (O.S.)
BB-8. You're wasting your time.
BB-8 looks up at C-3PO, who stands there. C-3PO SIGHS.

C-3PO (CONT'D)
It is very doubtful that R2 would
have the rest of the map in his backup
data.

(BB-8 BEEPS)
I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in
low power mode ever since Master
Luke went away. Sadly, he may never
be his old self again.

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

Leia hears the change in Han's voice and softens. She turns.

HAN
Listen to me, will you? I know every
time you... every time you look at
me, you're reminded of him.

LEIA
You think I want to forget him? I
want him back!
Han looks at her with sympathy.

HAN
There was nothing we could've done.
(hard for him to say)
There was too much Vader in him.

LEIA
That's why I wanted him to train
with Luke. I just never should have
sent him away. That's when I lost
him. That's when I lost you both.









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HAN
We both had to deal with it in our
own way. I went back to the only
thing I was ever good at.

LEIA
We both did.

HAN
We lost our son, forever.

LEIA
No.

(LONG BEAT)
It was Snoke.
Han takes this in.

LEIA (CONT'D)
He seduced our son to the dark side.
But we can still save him. Me.
You.

HAN
If Luke couldn't reach him, how could

I?

LEIA
Luke is a Jedi... you're his father.
There's still light in him. I know
it.

GENERAL STATURA
General, the reconnaissance report
on the enemy base is coming.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

Rey wakes, disoriented. She is in an angled, upright
restraining rig. Looks over, startled to see Kylo Ren, mask
in place, standing there.

REY
Where am I?

KYLO REN

(LONG BEAT)
You're my guest.

REY
Where are the others?

KYLO REN
You mean the murderers, traitors and
thieves you call friends?
(Rey stares at him)
You'll be relieved to hear that I
have no idea.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Rey studies him. She's fearful... but curious.

KYLO REN (CONT'D)
You still want to kill me.

REY
That happens when you're being hunted
by a creature in a mask.
Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches
and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment
before she regains her own mask of defiance.

KYLO REN
Tell me about the droid.

REY
(a nervous beat)
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive
and a thermal hyperscan vindicator --

KYLO REN
He's carrying a section of a
navigational chart. We have the
rest, recovered from archives of the
Empire. We need the last piece.
And somehow, you convinced the droid
to show it to you. You. A scavenger --
Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know?

KYLO REN (CONT'D)
You know I can take whatever I want.
Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer,
his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to
go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE...
THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes
between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER.
And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move,
quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing.

KYLO REN (CONT'D)
... You're so lonely... so afraid to
leave...
(then, slight smile)
At night, desperate to sleep... you
imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see
the island...
Tears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to
break free, but can't budge.

KYLO REN (CONT'D)
And Han Solo. You feel like he's
the father you never had. He would've
disappointed you.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
His hand still on her face, her eyes fierce through the agony:

REY
-- Get out of my head --
But this just makes Kylo lean closer.

KYLO REN
I know you've seen the map. It's in
there... and now you'll give it to
me. Don't be afraid. I feel it
too.
Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but:

REY
I'm not giving you anything.

KYLO REN
We'll see.
He peers into her eyes intensely. She meets his gaze --

DESPITE THE PAIN SHE IS STRONG.
On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has
slammed up against a barrier in her mind. He looks less
certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The
FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass

AND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED

AT WHAT SHE IS SEEING!

REY
... You... you're afraid... that you
will never be as strong as... Darth
Vader!
KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were
FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body
is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on
Kylo Ren, who starts to leave.
And we PRELAP:

SNOKE (V.O.)
This scavenger, resisted you?

INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

Kylo Ren, mask off, stands before Snoke.

KYLO REN
She's strong with the Force, untrained
but, stronger than she knows.
And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke:

SNOKE
And the droid?





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Kylo Ren hesitates to reveal the truth. Then:

GENERAL HUX (O.S.)
Ren believed it was no longer valuable
to us.
Ren turns back -- Hux enters the large space, moves to the
platform beside Ren.

GENERAL HUX (CONT'D)
That the girl was all we needed. As
a result, the droid has most likely
been returned to the hands of the
enemy. They may have the map already.
Snoke is visibly furious.

SNOKE
Then the Resistance must be destroyed
before they get to Skywalker.

GENERAL HUX
We have their location. We tracked
their reconnaissance ship to the
Ileenium system.

SNOKE
Good. Then we will crush them once
and for all. Prepare the weapon.
Kylo Ren is stunned by the moment -- that isn't what he meant
at all --

KYLO REN
Supreme Leader. I can get the map
from the girl. I just need your
guidance.

SNOKE
If what you say about this girl is
true, bring her to me.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

SLOW PUSH IN ON REY, shackled, mind still racing over what's
happened between her and Kylo Ren. She is flooded with
emotions, feeling her potential, her strength, that in this
moment of being restrained, perhaps anything is possible.
She turns to the Stormtrooper Guard. Studies him for an
intense beat. Then says:

REY
You will remove these restraints.
And leave this cell, with the door
open.
The Stormtrooper Guard looks at her. A beat.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

TROOPER GUARD  2
What did you say?
Rey's eyes stay trained on him. She shifts in her seat, her
confidence wavering, but she repeats, with authority:

REY
You will remove these restraints.
And leave this cell, with the door
open.
The Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER.
Rey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or
laughed at? The tension unbearable when the Guard says:

TROOPER GUARD  2
I'll tighten those restraints,
scavenger scum!

INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 1 - DAY

LOW ANGLE: Kylo Ren, masked, rounds a corner, PASSES US.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

Rey stares intently at the trooper. Calms herself. And
tries again.

REY
You will remove these restraints.
And leave this cell, with the door
open.

TROOPER GUARD  2
I will remove these restraints. And
leave this cell, with the door open.
He reaches down and UNLATCHES THE RESTRAINTS. HE THEN TURNS
AND STARTS TO HEAD OUT, her back to him as he exits. SHE IS
IN SHOCK. Then tries, quickly:

REY
And you will drop your weapon.

TROOPER GUARD  2
And I'll drop my weapon.
The Trooper Guard DROPS HIS WEAPON without turning back --
Rey HEARS the gun fall. She's incredulous. The guard has

LEFT THE CELL, ITS DOOR OPEN.
REY, in ABSOLUTE DISBELIEF, MOVES QUICKLY OUT OF FRAME!

INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

Kylo Ren enters the cell -- we PUSH IN ON HIM as he takes in
the empty cell -- AND IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTANDS WHAT HAS

HAPPENED.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

KYLO REN

NO!
Enraged, he RIPS OUT HIS SABER and --

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR 1 - DAY

WIDE ANGLE, empty corridor, toward the cell: we only HEAR
the horrible SOUNDS. DESTRUCTION. YELLING. A few pieces
of red hot DEBRIS BOUNCES into the corridor.
Two STORMTROOPERS, crossing at the far end of the hall, STOP
TO WATCH this display of pure FURY. They retreat, and fast.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Workers at their controls. Vast snowy landscape seen outside.
Their GAUGES RISE -- THE WEAPON CHARGING SLOWLY --

GENERAL HUX
Begin charging the weapon!

STARKILLER TECHNICIAN
Yes, sir. Weapon charging.

EXT. STARKILLER BASE PLANET - DAY

A vast view of the planet -- a MASSIVE SOLARVAC ARRAY
surrounds a port TEN MILES IN DIAMETER.
MILLIONS OF PANELS turn on the ARRAY -- a wave of BRILLIANT
REFLECTIONS. Suddenly, like a planetary-scale TESLA COIL
LINE OF ENERGY, THE POWER OF THE SUN begins to TRAVEL DOWN
to the Starkiller Base planet.

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

Finn, now a member of the inner circle of the Resistance, is
huddled with the group around the MAP TABLE, which displays
a WIREFRAME HOLOGRAM of a ROLLING VIEW OF THE SURFACE OF
STARKILLER BASE. With Finn are Han, Leia, Poe, C-3PO,
Statura, Ackbar, Brance, SNAP, MAJOR EMATT (60), NIEN NUNB,
and others. An urgent, messy strategy session --

POE
The scan data from Snap's
reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's
report.

SNAP
They've somehow created a hyper
lightspeed weapon built within the
planet itself.

BRANCE
A laser cannon?









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

SNAP
We're not sure how to describe a
weapon of this scale.

MAJOR EMATT

(HORRIBLE MEMORIES)
It's another Death Star.

POE
I wish that were the case, Major.
Poe hits a control. A WIREFRAME OF THE DEATH STAR APPEARS.

POE (CONT'D)
This was the Death Star.
Poe hits another control -- the Death Star SHRINKS -- AND
SHRINKS AND SHRINKS, as the SURFACE AREA OF THE STARKILLER

BASE IS DRAWN INTO A LARGER IMAGE, REVEALING THE ENTIRE BASE
PLANET. The Death Star is a minuscule SATELLITE in
comparison.

POE (CONT'D)
This is Starkiller Base.
This is news to many here, and they're stunned.

HAN
So it's big.

ADMIRAL ACKBAR
How is it possible to power a weapon
of this size?

FINN
It uses the power of the sun. As
the weapon is charged, the sun is
drained until it disappears.
An OFFICER runs up, hands Leia a DATACARD.

LEIA
(eyes on datacard)
The First Order: they're charging
the weapon again, now.
(then, heart sinking)
Our system is the next target.

C-3PO
Oh my. Without the Republic fleet,
we're doomed.
They all react to this horrible news.

HAN
Okay, how do we blow it up?
(all eyes on him)
There's always a way to do that.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
But no one has anything. Leia watches the silence,
frustrated. Finally, rallying them:

LEIA
Han's right.
Han is surprised.

ADMIRAL STATURA
(at first hesitant)
In order for that amount of power to
be contained, that base would need
some kind of thermal oscillator...

FINN
There is one.
All eyes on Finn as he moves around the hologram to a location
on the Starkiller Base -- it is ZOOMED IN: A GIANT BLACK

HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE.

FINN (CONT'D)
Precinct 47. Here.

ADMIRAL STATURA

(HYPOTHESIZING)
If we can destroy that oscillator,
it might de-stabilize the core and
cripple the weapon.

MAJOR EMATT
... Maybe the planet.
Poe then tries to bolster spirits, looking at the BIG
HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE: the Oscillator.

POE
We'll go in there and we'll hit that
oscillator with everything we got.

ADMIRAL ACKBAR
They have defensive shields that our
ships cannot penetrate.

HAN
We disable the shields.

(TO FINN)
Kid, you worked there, what do you
got?

FINN
(beat, then:)
I can do it.

HAN
I like this guy.









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN
I can disable the shields. But I
have to be there, on the planet--

HAN
We'll get you there.

LEIA
Han, how?

HAN
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.

POE
So we disable the shields, take out
the oscillator and we blow up their
big gun. All right. Let's go!
And everyone splits.

EXT. HANGARS, RESISTANCE BASE - DAY


SERIES OF SHOTS: THE RESISTANCE FLEET PREPARES FOR ITS
MISSION. Pilots inspect crafts, including Snap, Nien Nunb,
and Poe at his black-marked X-wing. Mechanics make
adjustments as Crews fuel the jets. Ground controllers move
ships into takeoff formation. Pilots prep their ships,
including BB-8, who is PULLED INTO Poe's black X-wing.
Finn approaches Poe wearing the jacket.
Poe slaps Finn's shoulder as he heads off. Finn watches
Poe, despite it all, a little laugh. Over this:

EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

Chewie and Finn follow Han's orders as they prepare the Falcon
for one more daring run, maybe its last:

HAN
Chewie, check that donal capitator.
Come on. Let's go. -- Finn, be
careful with those - they're
explosives.

FINN
Now you tell me?

LEIA
No matter how much we fought, I've
always hated watching you leave.
Han looks over, there's Leia.

HAN
That's what I did it. So you'd miss
me.
She laughs, moves up close to him.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

LEIA
I did miss you.
He looks at her, says sweetly, out of the blue:

HAN
It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh?
Some of it was...good.

LEIA
... Pretty good.

HAN
Some things never change.

LEIA

(SMILES)
True. You still drive me crazy.
Han places his hands on her shoulders. It could be thirty
years ago.
They both know there's a good chance he won't make it back.
They pull each other tight, holding for dear life. Quietly,

LONGINGLY:

LEIA (CONT'D)
If you see our son again, bring him
home.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY


STORMTROOPER
Sir, sensors triggered in hangar

Kylo exits.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY

TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner.
Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove,
the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT.

EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE - DAY

The Falcon SCREAMS PAST --

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Flying at LIGHTSPEED, Finn, with Han and Chewie.







(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

FINN
How are we getting in?

HAN
Their shields have a fractional
refresh rate. Keeps anything
traveling slower than lightspeed
from getting through.
Finn is suddenly filled with dread.

FINN
We're gonna make our landing approach
at lightspeed?!
Chewie, thinking it's crazy too, says: HELL YES WE ARE!

HAN
Alright, Chewie, get ready.
Chewie GROANS: he's ready. Han studies the PANEL INDICATORS.

HAN (CONT'D)
And Now!
Chewie and Han hit switches --



EXT. LIGHTSPEED SPACE STARKILLER BASE - DAY

The Falcon's ENVIRONMENT SHIFTS INSTANTLY FROM LIGHTSPEED TO
PLANET ATMOSPHERE -- it's suddenly FLYING 100 FEET ABOVE THE

SNOWY, ROCKY GROUND, HEADED FOR A THICK FOREST!

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY


CHEWIE GROANS:

HAN

I AM PULLING UP!!!

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

But the Falcon has no time -- it PLOWS through the trees!
It then RISES --

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

ALARMS BLARE as the ship SLAMS THROUGH BRANCHES, SHOOTS TOWARD
SKY! Han does his best to steer -- Chewie GROANS -- in the
madness Han YELLS:

HAN
I get any higher, they'll see us!
And the ship DIVES again, back into the trees!

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - CLEARING - DAY

A quiet CLEARING on the forest TREELINE. Suddenly the
MILLENNIUM FALCON HURTLES OUT OF THE FOREST! From an eruption
of BRANCHES and PINE, the ship DIVES -- SLAMS INTO THE SNOW!
It DIGS THROUGH A THOUSAND YARDS OF WHITE until it finally
comes to a canted stop, half buried in the snow!

INT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY


OFFICER
Sir, she was not found in hangar 718
but all troops are on alert.

KYLO REN
Put every hangar on lock-down. She's
going to try to steal a ship to--
Suddenly, Kylo senses something. Something familiar.

KYLO REN (CONT'D)
Han Solo...

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

MASSIVE WIDE SHOT of an EPIC SNOWSCAPE. Han, Finn and Chewie
cross the terrain. WALKERS appears on the horizon. Han,
Finn and Chewie take cover behind a base structure. Chewie
carries a BLACK DUFFEL of EXPLOSIVES.

FINN
The flooding tunnels are over that
ridge. We'll get in that way.

HAN
What was your job when you were based
here?

FINN
Sanitation.

HAN
Sanitation? Then how do you know
how to disable the shields?

FINN
I don't. I'm just here to get Rey.

HAN
People are counting on us! The galaxy
is counting on us--!

FINN
Solo, we'll figure it out! We'll
use the Force!

HAN
That's not how the Force works--!



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Chewie MOANTALKS.

HAN (CONT'D)
Oh really, you're cold?

A STORMTROOPER waits to board a Transport Compartment. The
door WHOOSHES open -- HAN, FINN and CHEWIE are there!

STORMTROOPER FN-9330
Hey!
He fumbles for his blaster but Chewie shoots first. WIDE
ANGLE of the corridor as the Trooper flies back, dead.
Chewie drags him out of sight. Han and Finn peer around a
corner, wary.

HAN
The longer we're here, less luck
we're going to have. The shields?

FINN
I have an idea about that.
Han and Chewie follow Finn.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - CORRIDOR - DAY

Captain Phasma heads down a corridor, distant Stormtroopers.
Suddenly Phasma is T-BONED HARD AND FAST -- SHOVED OUT OF

FRAME BY CHEWIE!
And now we're in a NARROW CROSS-CORRIDOR, CHEWIE WITH HIS

ARMS AROUND PHASMA, FORCED TO FACE FINN, WHO HOLDS HIS BLASTER
ON HIS FORMER CAPTAIN. Han stands behind Finn.

FINN
Remember me?

Bring it down. Bring it down.

FINN
Follow me.
Finn SMILES as we CUT TO:

INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY

TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner.
Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove,
the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT.
From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR
WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the other
side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the white
pill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET.
At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing
HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside.
TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. But the problem:
between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF
STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation.
As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR
BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORM-
and SNOWTROOPERS headed her way!
Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across
the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing
over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue.
WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off,
not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her.
But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. She
strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, which
She opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch
behind her.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - INSIDE THE WALLS - DAY

A REMARKABLE IMAGE, inside the inner workings of the base.
Tiny by comparison, Rey climbs amid the incredible
infrastructure, a drop to infinity beneath her. She is
between the LIGHT SOURCE and the WHITE PILL SHAPES, as she
makes her way ACROSS.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY

WIDE SHOT of the Stormtrooper GUARDS, above the drop off
into the atrium. What they cannot see is a SHADOWED
SILHOUETTE OF REY against the ENDLESS WHITE PILL LIGHTS as
she climbs across the space, beneath them, toward her exit!

INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ACCESS POINT - DAY

CLOSE AS PHASMA SITS INTO FRAME in front of a WORKSTATION --
Finn, Han and Chewie, blasters aimed. Phasma reluctantly
works controls on the workstation.

FINN
You want me to blast that bucket off
your head? Lower the shields.

CAPTAIN PHASMA
You're making a big mistake.

FINN
Do it.
Chewie MOAN TALKS. Phasma hits a few more buttons -- the
controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLE INITIATE". Eyes on

THE WORKSTATION:

FINN (CONT'D)
Solo, if this works, we're not going
to have a lot of time to find Rey.

HAN
Don't worry kid, we won't leave here
without her.
The controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLED".

CAPTAIN PHASMA
(to Finn, cruel)
You can't be so stupid as to think
this will be easy. My troops will
storm this block and kill you all.

FINN
I disagree. What do we do with her?

HAN
Is there a garbage chute? Trash
compactor?

FINN
Yeah, there is...

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

INT. STARKILLER BASE - JUNCTION AREA - DAY

Finn, Han and Chewie take cover, Chewie pulling some
EXPLOSIVES out of the duffel. Blast doors nearby.

FINN
We'll use the charges to blow that
blast door. I'll go in and draw
fire, but I'm gonna need cover.

HAN
You sure you're up for this?

FINN
Hell no -- I'll go in find and try
to find Rey --
(improvising, fast)
-- The troopers'll be on our tail.
We have to be ready for that. There's
an access tunnel that'll leads --
(Han starts pointing
with his chin to

SOMETHING BEHIND

FINN)
Why are you doing that? Why are you
doing -- this? I'm trying to come
up with a plan.
Finn turns -- AND SEES REY, CLIMBING OUT FROM INSIDE THE
WALL, carefully climbing back up to the main level! He can't
believe it! Chewie MURMURS his relief. Han is maybe more
grateful than anyone.

A Resistance Technician turns to Leia:

HAN
Are you all right?

REY
Yeah.

HAN
Good.

FINN
What happened -- did he hurt you?

REY
Finn. What are you doing here?!

FINN
We came back for you.
She is speechless -- this is all she's ever wanted anyone to
do. Chewie TALKS -- and Rey's eyes nearly tear up.

FINN (CONT'D)
What'd he say?

REY
(shrugs, smiles, though
nearly in tears)
... That it was your idea.
Finn awkwardly smiles. It's his nature. They embrace.

REY (CONT'D)
Thank you.

FINN
How did you get away?

REY
I can't explain it. And you wouldn't
believe it.

HAN
Escape now. Hug later.

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

The X-Wings DOGFIGHT with the TIE Fighters on the surface of

PULL BACK TO REVEAL Han, Finn, Rey and Chewie, who run out
here, into the snow, stopping, eyes on the sky, watching the
lop-sided battle.

THE FOUR HEROES TURN TO EACH OTHER, RESOLVE IN THEIR EYES.
A long moment of communication.

HAN
They're in trouble. We can't leave.
(to Finn, re: Chewie)
My friend here has a bag full of
explosives. Let's use 'em.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

Han and Chewie arrive here to find THREE SECURITY
STORMTROOPERS approaching a Maintenance Hatch. Instantly,
Chewie takes out the middle one with his Bowcaster. Han and
the other two Stormtroopers OPEN FIRE, but Han's aim is true.

ALARMS START BLARING!

INT. JUNCTION STATION - NEAR DARKNESS

Running inside from a parked snowspeeder, Rey opens a service
hatch. Finn behind her, as she reaches into the mechanics
of the place, very much like the very first shot we saw of
Rey.
And she YANKS a piece of TECH from the machinery and:

INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

The HATCH OPENS! Han and Chewie, having been on the lookout,
step inside, weapons poised. Chewie MOANS.

HAN
That girl knows her stuff.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

Han and Chewie divide the explosives. Talk in hushed tones.

HAN
We'll set the charges at every other
column.
He GROAN TALKS to Han, who looks around, reconsiders.

HAN (CONT'D)
You're right. That's a better idea.
(checks his detonator)
You take the top.

(CHEWIE DOES)
I'll go down below. Detonator.
We'll meet back here.
They head off in opposite directions.

INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

Han finishes placing an explosive. Checks he's all-clear
and hurries down to the next level. Chewie climbs up a level.

INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NEAR DARKNESS

A SQUAD of Stormtroopers SNAP to alert as Kylo Ren approaches.
CONTROLS ARE HIT and the huge DOOR OPENS. Without hesitation,
Kylo walks INTO THE OSCILLATOR.

INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

A COLOSSAL CYLINDRICAL STRUCTURE. DARK CORRIDORS and
CATWALKS. Kylo Ren comes to a stop. Scans the structure.
SENSING SOMETHING, he motions the Stormtrooper Squad upwards.

KYLO REN
Find them.
They rush past him. Kylo Ren turns slowly, and HEADS DOWN.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

The Stormtroopers move up the ramp, weapons ready, checking
carefully where blind corners intersect from the perimeter.
They come round to the next higher level and PASS CLOSE TO
CAMERA. When they've passed, TILT to find CHEWIE, in the
shadows of the grillwork.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


Once they're gone, he plants another charge.

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

The Snowspeeder comes to a stop outside the structure. Finn
and Rey stop for a moment, look to the sky: THE SUN IS NEARLY

GONE.

INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT

Han finishes setting a charge and is about to move on when
he HEARS SOMETHING and conceals himself behind a wide,
vertical support. He peaks around the edge and his whole
demeanor changes --
HAN'S POV: Kylo Ren appears and stops at the railing, looking
down into the filter.
Han looks at his son with a tortured storm of feelings.
WE'RE WITH KYLO REN as he resumes his hunt. He heads directly
toward WHERE HAN IS HIDING! Kylo Ren has an INCREASING SENSE
OF HAN'S PRESENCE as he moves closer. He comes to where Han
was hiding -- but HAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.
From his hiding place in a narrow, POWER CHAMBER in the wall,

HAN WATCHES HIS SON PASS ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF HIM.
Han SHIFTS HIS POSITION in the tight compartment, so he can
watch Ren's progress. Kylo Ren turns onto a FLAT BRIDGE
THAT BISECTS the open space.
Unaware of his father, Kylo Ren walks purposefully across to
the opposite side. Han watches his son walk off -- the CLANK-
CLANK of Kylo Ren's boots receding.
This is Han's opportunity to escape but Leia's words echo
through his mind. He makes a decision and moves out, to the
edge of the catwalk. He calls out, strongly:

HAN
Ben!
The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast
catwalk. He turns.

KYLO REN
Han Solo. I've been waiting for
this day for a long time.
Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH
that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like
a spotlight on Han and his son. Finn and Rey get to a railing
and look down. They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on
the catwalk below.









(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HAN
Take off that mask. You don't need
it.

KYLO REN
What do you think you'll see if I
do?
Han moves toward Kylo Ren.

HAN
The face of my son.
Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED -- seeing the face
of his son for the first time as a man.

KYLO REN
Your son is gone. He was weak and
foolish, like his father. So I
destroyed him.

HAN
That's what Snoke wants you to believe
but it's not true. My son is alive.
SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch.

INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NEAR DARKNESS

Kylo flares.

KYLO REN
No. The Supreme Leader is wise.
UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. Stormtroopers
dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene.
ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern:

HAN
Snoke is using you for your power.
When he gets what he wants, he'll
crush you -- you know it's true.
Kylo hesitates. Somehow, he does know it.

KYLO REN
It's too late.

HAN
No it's not. Leave here with me.
Come home. We miss you.
For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears
flood his stoic eyes...

KYLO REN
I'm being torn apart. I want to be
free of this pain.

INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - DARKNESS FALLS

Han takes one step toward his son, but stops himself.

KYLO REN
I know what I have to do, but I don't
know if I have the strength to do
it. Will you help me?
Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable.

HAN
Yes. Anything.
Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to
Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe
it. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the
LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch

VANISHES.
Han actually smiles -- and reaches out for the dark weapon --
but with the light now gone, KYLO REN'S EYES FILL WITH

DARKNESS, HE IGNITES THE LIGHTSABER -- THE FIERY BLADE SHOOTS

OUT, RIGHT THROUGH HAN'S CHEST AND BACK!

KYLO REN
Thank you.
ABOVE, Finn and Rey GASP -- SCREAM --

FINN

(PANTING)
Solo.

REY

(ALSO PANTING)
No, no.
Han's last moment is looking into his son's face. HAN'S
KNEES BUCKLE. The blade tilts down with him... until KYLO
REN EXTINGUISHES IT AND HAN HOLDS onto the catwalk -- his
life slipping away.
Finally Han FALLS BACK, OFF THE CATWALK, INTO THE DEPTHS OF

THE STRUCTURE!

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

Leia, feeling it instantly -- knowing -- drops into a seat,

DEVASTATED.

INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NIGHT

Kylo Ren is somehow WEAKENED by this wicked act. Himself
horrified. His SHOCK is broken only when --
CHEWIE CRIES OUT IN AGONY! Chewie furiously FIRES AT KYLO
REN, HITTING HIM IN THE SIDE! Kylo Ren falls back, stunned.





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
Our MUSIC TAKES OVER, EPIC AND HEARTBREAKING as Stormtroopers
FIRE AT CHEWIE, who is forced to retreat down a corridor,
where he holds the EXPLOSIVE REMOTE -- he PUSHES THE BUTTON!
Hearing ONLY OUR SCORE, FIRST ONE, then TWO, then FOUR, then
SIX EXPLOSIONS rock the structure -- CATWALKS FALL as the
walls CAVE IN!
Kylo Ren SEES REY AND FINN, WATCHING THE EXPLOSIONS IN SHOCK --
then they SEE KYLO REN, WHO RECOGNIZES THEM BOTH, WITH
ASTONISHMENT. He rises to his full height and heads for
them with long strides.
Stormtroopers begin to BLAST AWAY AT REY AND FINN! CRAZED,

REY FIRES BACK AS BLASTS HIT AROUND HER. FINN WRAPS AN ARM

AROUND HER AND DRAGS CARRIES HER OUT OF SIGHT!

ADMIRAL ACKBAR
The Oscillator's been damaged but is

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

From a distance the oscillator is ablaze and fractured from
the explosives. Then Rey and Finn appear, coming over a
rising, running into a bare-tree snowy forest.

FINN
The Falcon's this way.
Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy
forest -- until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both
out of breath. They look at each other. They both know:
they can't run.

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - FOREST - NIGHT

Kylo Ren moves through the trees -- until he STOPS. Takes
out the saber, ignites it.
A still figure amidst the gusts of wind and snow.

STANDING THIRTY FEET AWAY, FACING HIM, ARE FINN AND REY.
Finn holds LUKE'S LIGHTSABER, Rey the Stormtrooper BLASTER.

KYLO REN
We're not done yet.

REY
You're a monster!





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

KYLO REN
It's just us now. Han Solo can't
save you.
After a beat, Rey moves forward with the blaster -- AIMS IT!
Kylo Ren RAISES A HAND -- Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER --
she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the WOUND
Chewie inflicted. Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY -- Rey's
BLASTER FLIES OUT OF HER HAND -- another GESTURE and Rey
FLIES BACK and SLAMS INTO A TREE thirty feet away!
She drops -- LANDS HARD in the snow. Dazed, hurt.

FINN
Rey! Rey! Rey... Rey... Oh no. Oh
no no no...
Finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. But the SOUND OF
KYLO REN'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO KYLO
REN, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE.

KYLO REN

TRAITOR!
In reply, Finn TURNS ON LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- upon seeing the
weapon, Kylo Ren REACTS IN SHOCK.

KYLO REN (CONT'D)
That lightsaber. It belongs to me!

FINN
Come get it.
Despite his fear, Finn raises his blade in welcome. Kylo
Ren CHARGES at him - Finn terrified -- Kylo Ren LUNGES but
Finn DEFLECTS Ren's SPARK-SPITTING blade!
Kylo Ren TURNS, ATTACKS, CUTS -- amazingly Finn BLOCKS,
COUNTER-ATTACKS -- clearly IMPRESSES KYLO REN, who only enjoys
this challenge more!
Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. Her eyes focus on the two
men fighting, through the trees.
Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks
with a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE
moves into OFFENSIVE ones. And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN!
LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK --
wounded, but more enraged than weakened. Kylo Ren CHARGES
AGAIN -- their WEAPONS POUND, SPARKS FLY, their blades LOCK,
the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers:
And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity --
Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness.
Rey sees this -- Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF
BLOWS, pushing Finn further and further back until he loses
balance.



(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
That's when KYLO REN STRIKES: HE LANDS A BLOW TO FINN'S TORSO --

LUKE'S LIGHTSABER FLIES FROM FINN'S HAND, THROWN TWENTY FEET!
Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS LIGHTSABER and REACHES FOR LUKE'S

LIGHTSABER -- BECKONING IT WITH THE FORCE.

LUKE'S LIGHTSABER VIBRATES IN THE SNOW.
Kylo Ren GESTURES, INCREASES HIS POWER -- LUKE'S LIGHTSABER

FINALLY FLIES OUT OF THE SNOW, BULLETS TOWARD KYLO REN --

-- AND SPEEDS PAST HIM!

KYLO REN TURNS TO SEE LUKE'S LIGHTSABER LAND IN THE HAND OF

REY, WHO STANDS, FACING HIM, HAVING REACHED FOR IT HERSELF,

BUT UTTERLY STUNNED THAT IT LANDED IN HER HAND! SHE IS

SHOCKED -- AND SO IS KYLO REN!
Holding it with both hands, SHE IGNITES LUKE'S LIGHTSABER

FOR THE FIRST TIME, HER EYES BLAZING.
Kylo Ren IGNITES HIS SABER.
It's REY who charges now -- Kylo Ren immediately on the
defensive. They BATTLE POWERFULLY -- He is clearly rocked
by her raw, innate skill.

INT. X-WING - NIGHT


NIV LEK
We just lost R-1!

JESS
We're overwhelmed! What do we do?
It isn't working!
Another pilot looks down -- SEES THE EXPLOSION -- coming
from the OSCILLATOR. Relatively small, it's an opening:

YOLO ZIFF
Black Leader, there's a brand new
hole in that oscillator. Looks like
our friends got in!

POE
Red Four! Red Six! Cover us!

LT. BASTIAN
I'm on it!

ELLO ASTY
Roger!

POE
Everybody else, hit the target hard!
Give it everything you got!
And the X-WINGS DIVE and BLAST the OSCILLATOR --

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT

Another two X-wings -- including Poe's -- soar through the
trench leading to the oscillator structure!

POE
I need some help here! I need some
help!

LT. BASTIAN
I'm coming in!

JESS
Watch out!

ELLO ASTY
I'm hit!
The alien pilot's X-wing is blasted to pieces.

POE
All teams - I'm going in! Pull up
and cover me!

NIV LEK
Copy that, Black Leader! Good luck,
Poe!
The trailing X-wings peel off as Poe's black fighter darts
into the fiery breach.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NEAR DARKNESS

Outside, the SUN ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE -- PULL BACK THROUGH

THE WINDOW TO REVEAL A STARKILLER TECHNICIAN:

STARKILLER TECHNICIAN
Weapon at full capacity in thirty
seconds.

GENERAL HUX
Prepare to fire.

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT

Poe's X-wing weaves through the breach. A pursuing TIE
fighter does not clear the gap, leaving Poe to circle the
interior of the unguarded structure, firing volley after
volley of torpedoes.

EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT

The remaining X-Wings -- including Poe's -- BLAST the place --
and the structure begins to CRATER, deep underground

EXPLOSIONS!

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

Amid the BARE WHITE TREES, ONLY TWO LIGHTSABERS -- LUKE'S
BLUE AND REN'S YELLOW-RED -- ILLUMINATE the FLURRIES OF SNOW
as Rey and Kylo Ren BATTLE HARD.
She seems to be, impossibly, STRONGER THAN HE IS for half a
dozen blows -- until he FINDS HIS STRENGTH and FIGHTS BACK --
MOVING FORWARD and PUSHING REY BACK, into the forest.
Suddenly a COLOSSAL CHUNK OF THE FOREST RIGHT BEHIND REY
DROPS AWAY! Rey is suddenly fighting on the EDGE OF A

MASSIVE, BRAND NEW CLIFF!

KYLO REN
You need a teacher! I can show you
the ways of the Force!

REY
The Force.
Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them,
she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED
SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible
FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS
BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER!
Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE
GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES

AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND

CHEST. HE GOES DOWN, SUDDENLY A FEARFUL MAN, A LARGE BURN
SCAR SLASHED ACROSS HIS FACE! He still reaches for his saber.
And she could kill him -- right now, with ONE VICIOUS STRIKE!
But she stops. Realizing she stands on a greater edge than
even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. The earth
SHAKES. The earth splits. A gully forms.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

The area where the RALLY was held is now COLLAPSING into a
giant sink hole! We WHIP PAN to a YOUNG TECHNICIAN, who
watches this out the control room window in horror. He
hurries off, passing COLONEL DATOO, who admonishes:

COLONEL DATOO
Lieutenant, get back to your station!

YOUNG TECHNICIAN
(stops, fleetingly)
Just look. We won't survive -- even
Hux has gone!
As he hurries off, WE HEAR:

GENERAL HUX (V.O.)
Supreme Leader.

INT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

Hux stands before SNOKE'S IMAGE. Relative quiet here, but
distant SOUNDS OF DESTRUCTION. Hux tries to keep it together
but is horrified, heartsick:

GENERAL HUX
The fuel cells have ruptured. The
collapse of the planet has begun.
Snoke takes this in. Furious, desolate... knowing.

SNOKE
Leave the base at once and come to
me with Kylo Ren.

(GRIM)
It is time to complete his training.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

Rey turns, runs a hundred feet through the forest to:
FINN, who lies, near death, not far from where the GROUND
FELL AWAY. Rey falls to her knees near him, turns him over,
sees his cauterized but possibly fatal wound.

REY
Finn! Finn...
Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless
body in her arms. Snow flurries around them as she cries,
holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores.
They are left here to die -- nearby MORE TREES DROP as the
planet continues to COLLAPSE. And just as it seems like all
is lost... Her wet eyes look up to see:

LIGHTS RISE FROM THE NEWLY-FORMED CANYON -- IT'S A SHIP WE
KNOW -- IT'S THE MILLENNIUM FALCON -- and its lights

ILLUMINATE REY, WHOSE FACE FILLS WITH HOPE!
CHEWIE IS AT THE CONTROLS. He ROARS to them!

EXT. FALCON - NIGHT

Chewie exits the ship.
MOMENTS LATER Chewie CARRIES FINN up the ramp. Rey hurries
with them back into the ship --

INT. FALCON - NIGHT

Chewie carries Finn inside, followed by Rey.

EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

And we FLY WITH THE FALCON as it leaves the planet -- we can
see CHEWIE AND REY PILOTING, the COLLAPSING PLANET BEHIND
US. The Resistance X-wings, led by Poe, follow the Falcon.

INT. X-WING - NIGHT


POE
All teams! I got eyes on them!

SNAP
Yes!
The X-wings ROAR OFF, skyward as the MUSIC SOARS, the PLANET
IMPLODES -- THE SUNLIGHT IT CONTAINS BURSTS FORTH, and as we
get further and further distance from what was Starkiller
Base, we witness the REBIRTH OF A SUN. Light restored to a
corner of the galaxy.
The Millennium Falcon and the X-wings RIP THROUGH SPACE,
headed home.

POE
Our job's done here. Let's go home!

EXT. D'QAR - DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT as the Falcon on the landing strip.

EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

The Falcon has landed among the remaining Resistance ships.
Poe is there, watching as Chewie scuttles down the ramp
carrying an unconscious Finn. Medical Personnel and Officers,
meet them, usher them inside.

MEDIC
Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a
heartbeat.
Rey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, Leia.
C-3PO and BB-8 behind her. The crowds are cheering.
Rey is so sad for Leia, so sorry.
The two women move for each other. And Leia takes Rey's
face in her hands. Despite her heartbreak, she is grateful.
She embraces Rey. A mother's embrace.
Rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting.

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

Chewbacca sits quietly, as do many in the base, mourning
their losses.
As BB-8 approaches R2-D2, the long dormant droid suddenly
stirs. The droids beep at each other.

C-3PO
R2-D2! You've come back! You found
what? How dare you call me that!

(MORE)





(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

C-3PO (CONT'D)
(he swats R2-D2, who

CONTINUES BEEPING)
Find Master Luke how? Come, R2! We
must go tell the others at once!

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

Leia stands alone and in silence, heartbroken.

C-3PO (O.S.)
General? Excuse me, General?
Leia turns to see droids.

C-3PO (CONT'D)
R2-D2 may contain some much needed
good news.

LEIA
Tell me.
Rey stands with Leia, Poe C-3PO, BB-8 and a handful of
Resistance Officers. Suddenly R2-D2 PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM! A

LARGE NAVIGATIONAL MAP WITH A SPECIFIC MISSING CHUNK!
BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe turns to him --

POE
Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on --
Poe runs over -- removes the ancient data device that Lor
San Tekka had given him from a base computer. He inserts it
back inside BB-8, who then PROJECTS HIS MAP -- which he
SHRINKS DOWN TO SIZE -- and the two droids MOVE SLIGHTLY --

TOGETHER -- THE TWO HOLOGRAMS UNITE, BB-8'S PIECE FILLING IN

R2-D2'S PERFECTLY!
Everyone REACTS -- amazed --

C-3PO
Oh! The map! It is complete!

LEIA
(hand on her heart)
-- Luke --
Suddenly there are CHEERS AND EMBRACES.
C-3PO leans down to R2-D2 and says, quietly, sweetly:

C-3PO
(to R2-D2)
Oh my dear friend. How I've missed
you.

INT. RESISTANCE BASE - I.C.U. - DAY

A NEW DAY. Finn, unconscious in an I.C.U. POD. His fate
uncertain. Rey sits with him. Deeply worried. Finally she
leans in, close to him. She kisses him and says, quietly,
despite her fear:

REY
We'll see each other again. I believe
that. Thank you, my friend.

EXT. D'QAR - DAY

Chewie does last minute checks of the Falcon. Rey stands
with Leia a beat and then turns to head to the Falcon. As
Rey walks off, she hears Leia call out:

LEIA
Rey.
Rey turns around.

LEIA (CONT'D)
May the Force be with you.
This fills Rey up. She smiles gratefully. Rey crosses to
the Falcon.

INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

Rey sits in the pilot seat, Chewie as co-pilot. Rey looks
at him compassionately.
Rey FLICKS SWITCHES and --

EXT. D'QAR - DAY

The Millennium Falcon RISES.
Leia, with Poe, BB-8, and C-3PO (with his proper arm
replaced), watches the next generation of Jedi begin her
journey.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

The Falcon FLIES through space and BLASTS to LIGHTSPEED.

EXT. AHCH-TO - DAY

A pristine and mighty OCEAN. Endless BLUE, dotted with
random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted
with countless GREEN TREES.
The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of
the ISLANDS.

EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY

Rey, her staff strapped to her back, begins her hike up the
considerable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2,
who watch her from the bottom of the ramp. A deep breath
and Rey continues her journey.

EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STAIRS - DAY

Built within the rock and foliage of this idyllic island are
seemingly endless ANCIENT STONE STEPS. Rey continues to
climb them, determined, despite her fatigue.

EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STRUCTURES - DAY

Rey arrives at a clearing. Small, modest, primitive stone
structures. But no one around. Rey walks past them, sees,
senses no one.

And then she stops. Feels something. She turns.
Standing forty feet away from her, his back to us, is a MAN,
in a CLOAK AND ROBE.

Rey stares, knowing exactly who it is. But she just stares
for what seems like forever. Until he finally TURNS, SLOWLY,
to her. Pulls back his hood.

IT IS LUKE SKYWALKER.

Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness
in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't
need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His
look says it all.

In response, Rey pulls something from the pack.

LUKE'S LIGHTSABER.
And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's
only hope.

HOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and
conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise
of an adventure, just beginning...

1.

EXT - DAIRY FARM- DAY
The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the
French call cow country).
We Read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farm house;

CHAPTER ONE

"ONCE UPON A TIME IN...

NAZI OCCUPIED FRANCE"
This SUBTITLE disappears, and is replaced by another one;

"1941
One year into the German
occupation of France".
The farm consists of a house, small barn, and twelve cows spread
about.
The owner of the property, a bull of a man FRENCH FARMER, brings a axe
up and down on A tree stump blemishing his property. However simply by
sight, you'd never know if he's been beating at this stump for the last
year, or just started today.

JULIE
One of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging up laundry on
the clothes line. As she hangs up a white bed sheet, she hears a
noise, moving the sheet aside she see's;

JULIE'S POV:
A Nazi town car convertible, with two little nazi flags attached to
the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in the
back seat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS on motorcycles, coming up
over the hill on the country road leading to their farm.

JULIE
Pappa.
The French Farmer sinks his axe in the stump, looks over his shoulder,
and see's the Germans approaching.
The FARMERS WIFE, CHARLOTTE comes to the doorway of their home,
followed by her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and see the Germans
approaching.
The Farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

FARMER
Go back inside and shut the door.









IL

FARMER
(to Julie)
Julie, get me some water from the pump
to wash up with, then get inside with
your mother.
The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a
basin, and begins pumping, after a few pumps, water comes out
splashing into the basin.
The French Farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping
away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from off
his face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for
a year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may
very well be the end.
Julie finishes filling the water basin, and places it on the window
sill.

JULIE
Ready Pappa.

FARMER
Thank you darling, now go inside and
take care of your mother. Don't run.
Julie walks inside the farm house and closes the door behind her.
As her father stands up from his stump, and moves over to the window
sill with the water basin...
.The SOUND of the ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get LOUDER.
The Farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his
front. He takes a towel off a nail, and wipes the excess water from
his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one
automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist
Party come to a halt on his property.
We don't move into them, but keep observing them from a distance, like
the Farmer.
The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLIST are off their bikes, and standing at
attention next to them.
The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile, and opened the door
for his superior.
The NAZI OFFICER says to The Driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN;

NAZI OFFICER
This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?









3

NAZI DRIVER
Yes heer Colonel.
The Nazi officer climbs out of the back the vehicle, carrying
in his left hand
n d

OFFICER
Herman, until I summon you, I am to be
left alone.

NAZI DRIVER
As you wish Heer Col.
The S.S. COLONEL yells to The Farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

NAZI OFFICER
Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?

FARMER
I am Perrier LaPadite.
The S.S. Colonel crosses the distance between them with long strides,
and says in French with a smile on his face;

NAZI OFFICER
It is a pleasure to meet you Monsieur
LaPadite, I am Colonel Hans Landa of
the S.S.
COLONEL.HANS LANDA offers the French Farmer PERRIER LAPADITE his hand.
The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it.

PERRIER
How may I help you?

COL LANDA
I was hoping you could invite me inside
your home and we may have a discussion.

INT - LAPADITE FARM HOUSE - DAY
The door to the farm house swings open, andtheaFarmer gesturestfor
the S.S. COL to enter. Removing his grey S.S. cap,
inside the Frenchman's home.
Col Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the Farmers wife,
and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen, smiling
in his direction.
The Farmer enters behind him, closing the door.









VA

PERRIER
Colonel Landa, this is my family.
The S.S. COL clicks his heels together, and takes the hand of the
French Farmers Wife...

COL LANDA
Col Hans Landa of the S.S. madame,
at your service.
He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his hostess
hand...

COL LANDA
please excuse my rude intrusion on your
routine.

FARMERS WIFE
Don't be ridiculous, heer Col.
While still holding the French Woman's hand, and looking into her
eyes, The S.S. Colonel says;

COL LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have
heard in the village about your family
are all true. Your wife is a beautiful
woman.
His eyes leave the mother, and move to the three daughters.

COL.LANDA

(CON' T )
And each of your daughters is more lovely
then the last.

PERRIER
Merci. Please have a seat.
The Farmer offers The S.S. Colonel a seat at the families wooden
dinner table. The Nazi officer excepts the French Farmers offer,
and lowers himself into the chair. Placing his grey S.S. cap on
the table, and keeping his black attache case on the floor by his
feet.
The Farmer (perfect host) turns to his Wife and says;

PERRIER
Charlotte, would you be so good as to get
The Colonel some wine?









COL LANDA
Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite, but no
wine. This being a dairy farm one would
be safe in assuming you have milk?

CHARLOTTE
Oui.

COL LANDA
Then milk is what I prefer.

CHARLOTTE
Very Well.
The mother of three, takes a craft of milk out of the ice box,
and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for The Colonel.
The S.S. Colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it down
LOUDLY on the wooden table.

COL LANDA
Monsieur, to both your family, and your
cows, I say; Bravo.

PERRIER
Merci.

COL LANDA
Please, join me at your
table.

PERRIER
Very well.
The French Farmer sit's at his wooden dinner table across from
The Nazi.
The Women remain standing.
Col Landa leans forward, and says to the Farmer in a low tone of

CONFIDENTIALLY;

COL LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to
discuss,' would be better discussed in
private. You'll notice, I left my men
outdoors- if it wouldn't offend them,
could you ask your lovely ladies to step
outside.

PERRIER
You are right.









G.

PERRIER
(to his women)
Charlotte, would you take the girls
outside. The Colonel and I need to have
a few words.
The Farmers wife follows her husbands orders, and gathers her
daughter's taking them outside, closing the door behind them.
The Two Men are alone, at the farmers dinner table, in the Farmers
humble home.

COL LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform
you I've exhausted the extent of my
French. To continue to speak it so
inadequately, would only serve to
embarrass me. However, I've been lead
to believe you speak English quite well?

PERRIER
Oui.

COL LANDA
Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
This being your house, I ask your
permission to switch to English, for the
remainder of the conversation?

PERRIER
By all means.
They now speak ENGLISH;

COL LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, while I'm very
familiar with you, and your family.
I have no way of knowing if you are
familiar with who I am. Are you aware
of my existence?
The Farmer answers;

PERRIER
Yes.

COL LANDA
This is good. Are you aware of the job
I've been ordered to carry out in France?









I

PERRIER
Yes.
The Colonel drinks more milk.

COL LANDA
Please tell me what you've heard?

PERRIER
I've heard, the fuhrer has put you in
charge of rounding up the Jews left in
France who are ether hiding, or passing
for Gentile.
The S.S.Colonel smiles.

COL LANDA
The Fuhrer couldn't of said it better
himself.

PERRIER
But the meaning of your visit, pleasant
though it is, is mysterious to me.
The Germans looked through my house nine
months ago for hiding Jews, and found
nothing.

COL LANDA
I'm aware of that, I read the report on
this area. But like any enterprise,
when under new management, there's
always a slight duplication of efforts.
Most of it being a complete waste of time,
but needs to be done nevertheless.
I just have A few questions Monsieur
LaPadite, if you can assist me with
answers, my department can close the
file on your family.
Taking his black leather attache case, and placing it on the table, he
takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts a expensive black
fountain pen from his uniform front pocket. Opening the folder, and
referring to it;

COL LANDA
Now before the occupation there were
four Jewish families in this area, all
dairy farmers like yourself.
The Loveitts, The Doleracs, The Rollins,
and The Dreyfus's, is that correct?









8,

PERRIER
To my knowledge those were the Jewish
families among the dairy farmers.
- Heer Colonel, would it disturb you if
I smoked my pipe?
Looking up from his papers.

COL LANDA
Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your
house, make yourself comfortable.
The Farmer gets up from the table, goes to his shelf over the
fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the
fixins to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi
guest.
As The Farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match
to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S. Colonel
studies the papers in front of him.

COL LANDA
Now according to these papers, all
the Jewish families in this area have
been accounted for - except, The Dreyfusis.
Somewhere in the last year it would appear
they have vanished.
Which leads me to the conclusion that
they've ether made good their escape,
or someone is very successfully hiding
them.
(looking up from
his papers, across
the table at The

FARMER)
What have you heard about The Dreyfusis
Monsieur LaPadite?

PERRIER
Only rumors -

COL LANDA
- I love rumors! Facts can be so
misleading, where rumors, true or false
are often reveling. So Monsieur LaPadite,
what rumors have you heard regarding
The Dreyfusis?
The Farmerlooks at Landa.









I.

COL LANDA
Speak freely Monsieur LaPadite, I want
to hear what the rumors are, not who told
them to you.
The Farmer puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.

PERRIER
Again, this is just a rumor - but we
heard the Dreyfusis had made there way
into Spain.

COL LANDA
So the rumors you've heard have been of
escape?

PERRIER
Yes.

COL LANDA
Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfusis
friendly?
As the Farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his
chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the
floorboards revealing;

FIVE HUMAN BEINGS
lying vertically underneath the farmers floorboards. These human
beings are The DREYFUSIS, who have lived lying down underneath the
dairy farmers house for the past year. But one couldn't call what The
Dreyfusis have done for the last year living. This family has done the
only thing they could, hidden from a occupying army that wishes to
exterminate them.

PERRIER
We were families in the same community,
in the same bussiness. I wouldn't say
we were friends, but members of the same
community, we had common interest.
The S.S. Colonel takes in this answer, seems to except it, then moves
to the next question.

COL LANDA
Having never met the Dreyfusis, would
you confirm for me the exact members of
the household and their names?









10.

PERRIER
There were five of them.
The father, Jacob... .wife, Miram...
her brother, Bob ...

COL LANDA
- How old is Bob?

PERRIER
Thirty - thirty one?

COL LANDA
Continue.

PERRIER
And the children... Amos... and Shoshanna.

COL LANDA
Ages of the children?

PERRIER
Amos - six - I believe. And Shosanna,
was fifteen or sixteen, I'm not really
sure.

CUT TO

UXT - DAIRY FARM - DAY
The Mother and her three Daughters finish taking the laundry off the
clothes line.
They can't hear anything going on inside.
e three Nazi Soldiers watch the three Daughters.

SACK TO LANDA AND PERRIER

COL LANDA
Well I guess that should do it.
Be begins gathering up his papers, and putting them back into his
ttache case.
the Farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.

COL LANDA
However, before I go, could I have another
glass of your delicious milk?








it.

PERRIER
But of course.
Farmer stands up, goes over to the ice box, and takes out the
aft of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi Colonel's glass,
German Officer talks.

COL LANDA
Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the
nickname the people of France have given
me?

PERRIER
I have no interest in such things.

COL LANDA
But you are aware of what they call me?

PERRIER
I'm aware.

COL LANDA
What are you aware of?

PERRIER
That they call you, "The Jew Hunter".

COL LANDA
Precisely! Now I understand your
trepidation in repeating it.
Before he was assassinated, Heydrich
apparently hated the moniker the good
people of Prague bestowed on him.
Actually why he would hate the name,
"The Hangman", is baffling to me
It would appear he did everything in
his power to earn it. But I, on the
other hand, love my unofficial title,
precisely because I've earned it.
As "The Jew Hunter" enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize
with the french farmer.

COL LANDA
The feature that makes me such a effective
hunter of the Jews, is, as opposed to most
German soldiers, I can think like a jew.
where they can only think like a German,
or more precisely, a German soldier.
Now if one were to determine what attribute
the German people share with a beast, it
would be the cunning and predatory instinct
of a hawk.









COL LANDA

(CON'T)
Negro's - gorilla's - brain - lips -
smell - physical strength - penis size.
But, if one were to determine what attributes
the jews share with a beast, it would be
that of the rat.
Now the Fuhrer and Gobbles propaganda
have said pretty much the same thing.
Where our conclusions differ, is I don't
consider the comparison a insult.
Consider for a moment, the world a rat
lives in. It's a hostile world indeed.
If a rat were to scamper through your
front door right now, would you greet it
with hostility?

PERRIER
I suppose I would.

COL LANDA
Has a rat ever done anything to you to
create this animosity you feel toward
them?

PERRIER
Rat's spread disease, they bite people -

COL LANDA
- Unless some fool is stupid enough to
try and handle a live one, rats don't
make it a practise of biting human beings.
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague,
but that was some time ago. In all your
born days, has a rat ever caused you to
be sick a day in your life? I purpose to
you, any disease a rat could spread,
a squirrel could equally carry.
Yet I assume you don't share the same
animosity with squirrels that you do with
rats, do you?

PERRIER
No.

COL LANDA
Yet, they are both rodent's, are they
not? And except for the fact that one
has a big bushy tail, while the other
has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin,
they even rather look alike, don't they?









13.6

PERRIER
It is a interesting thought,
beer Colonel.

COL LANDA
However, interesting as the thought may
be, it makes not one bit of difference
to how you feel. If a rat were to scamper
through your door, this very minute,
would you offer it a saucer of your
delicious milk?

PERRIER
Probably not.

COL LANDA
I didn't think so. You don't like them.
You don't really know why you don't like
them. All you know is, you find them
repulsive.
(let's the

METAPHOR
sink in)
What a tremendously hostile world a rat
must endure. Yet, not only does he
survive, he thrives. And the reason for
this, is because our little foe has a
instinct for survival and presavation
second to none. And that Monsieur, is
what a jew shares with a rat.
Consequently, a German soldier, conducts
a search of a house suspected of hiding
jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks
in the barn, he looks in the attic,
he looks in the cellar - he looks
everywhere, he would hide. But there are
many places it would never occur to a
hawk to hide. However the reason the
Fuhrer brought me off my Alps in Austria,
and placed me in French cow country today,
is because it does occur to me. Because
I'm aware what tremendous feats human
beings are capable of once they abandon
dignity.
(Changing tone)
May I smoke my pipe as well?
Th e Farmer's cool facade is little by little eroding.

PERRIER
Please, Cononel, make yourself at home.

The Jew Hunter, removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixings.

kith a yellow skin, made famous by Sherlock Holmes.
A the Nazi Colonel, busies himself with his smoking life, he
ontinues to hold court at the Frenchmans table.

COL LANDA
The other mistake the German soldier
make is their severe handling of the
citizens who give shelter and aid to
the Jews. These citizens are not enemies
of the state. They are simply confused
people, trying to make some sense out of
the madness war creates.
These citizens do not need punishing.
They simply need to be reminded of their
duty in war time.
Let's use you as a example Monsieur
LaPadite. In this war, you have found
yourself in the middle of a conflict
that has nothing to do with yourself,
your lovely ladies, or your cows - yet,
here you are.
So Monsieur LaPadite, let me purpose
a question. In this time of war, what is
your number one duty? Is it to fight the
Germans in the name of France to your
last breath? Or, is it to harass the
occupying army to the best of your
ability? Or, is it to protect the poor
unfortunate victims of warfare who can
not protect themselfs?
Or, is your number one duty in this time
of bloodshed, to protect those very
beautiful women who constitute your
family?
The Colonel lets the last statement stand.

COL LANDA
That was a question Monsieur LaPadite.
In this time of war, What do you consider
your number one duty?

PERRIER
To protect my family.

COL LANDA
Now, my job dictates, that I must have
my men enter your home, and conduct a
thorough search, before I can officially
cross your families name off my list.









COL LANDA

(CON'T)
And if there are any irregularities to be
found, rest assured, they will be.
That is unless, you have something to tell
me that will make the conducting of a
search unnecessary.

(PAUSE)
I might add also, that any information
that makes the preforming of My duty
easier, will not be met with punishment.
Actually quite the contrary, it will be
met with reward.
And that reward will be, your family
will cease to be harassed in anyway,
by the German military during the rest
of our occupation of your country.
The Farmer, pipe in mouth, stares across the table at his German
opponent.

COL LANDA
You are sheltering enemies of the state,
are you not?

PERRIER
Yes.

COL LANDA
Your sheltering them underneath your
floorboards aren't you?

PERRIER
Yes.

COL LANDA
Point out to me the area's where their
hiding.
The Farmer points out the area's on the floor with the Dreyfusis are
underneath.

COL LANDA
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,
I assume that while their listening,
they don't speak english?

PERRIER
Yes .

COL LANDA
I'm going to switch back to french now,
and I want you to follow my masquerade
- is that clear?









PERRIER
Yes.
Colonel Landa stands up from the table, and switching to FRENCH says

business here is done.
The Nazi Officer opens the front door, and silently motions for his
son to approach the house.

Yet the LaPadite women watch the Nazi soldiers, machine guns at ready,

her to escape, our not nessessarlly
the same thing. She's a young girl, no food,
no shelter, no shoes, who's just witnessed
the massacre of her entire family.
She may not survive the night. And after
word spreads about what happened today,
it's highly unlikely she will find any
willing farmers to extend her aid.
If I had to guess her fate, I'd say she'll
probably be turned in by some neighbour.
Or, she'll be spotted by some German
soldier. Or, we'll find her body in the
woods, dead from starvation or exposure.
Or, perhaps-she'll survive. She will
elude capture. She will escape to America.
She will move to New York city.
Where she will be elected, President of

Hitler pounds furiously on the desk with his fist.

HITLER
No, no, no, no, no, no! I have heard
the rumors myself! Solders of The Third
Reich, who have brought the world to
there knee s, now pecking and clucking
like chickens. Do you know the latest
rumor they've conjured up, in their fear
induced delirium? The one that beats
my boys with a bat. The one they call
"The Bear Jew"...is a Golem.
A avenging jew angel, conjured up by
a vengeful rabbi, to smite the Aryans!

Mine Fuhrer, this is just soldiers

His head lies on the ground horizontal. A HAND reaches into
FRAME, KNOCKS aside the dead German patriots helmet, and
grabs a handful of the cadavers blonde hair. A LARGE KNIFE
ENTERS FRAME, and begins SLICING ALONG THE HAIRLINE.
This process is called SCALPING.
After SLICING is complete, the SCALP easily peels off like a

Sgt.Rachtman is a little slow to respond. So Hirschberg
grabs him by the hair, YANKS him to his feet, and KICKS him
in the ass, sending him on his way.
Most of The Bastreds sit in a circle, Indian style, with
Aldo in the middle.
As Sgt.Rachtman walks towards this circle of Basterds,
A OFF SCREEN LITERARY NARRATOR (not Pvt.Butz) speaks over
the SOUNDTRACK in ENGLISH;

NARRATOR(VO)
Sgt.Werner Rachtman has seen many
interrogations since Germany decided
it should rule Europe. But this is
the first time he's ever been on the
wrong end of the exchange.
It's always been his belief, only a
weakling, in mind, body, and spirt
complies with the enemy under threat
of consequence.
As Werner watched men cry like women,
pleadingly offer their knowledge, in
exchange for their worthless lives,
he made a vow to himself.
If his role is to die in this conflict.
When they put him under the earth, his
dignity would be buried with him.
For in the other world, the gods only
respect the ones they test first.
Well Sgt, this is your test.
And the gods are watching.
The captured German Sgt, enters the circle of Basterds,
stands straight before the sitting southern Lieutenant, and
salutes his captor.

3Z..

DONNY
Mrs.Himmelstein, I'm Donny Donowitz,
my father Sy Donowitz, owns the barber
shop on Greeny Ave, "Sy's Barber Shop".

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
I've seen it. Do you live in the
neighbourhood?

DONNY
All my life.

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
Again, state your business?

DONNY
May I have a word with you?

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
What about?

DONNY
Our people in Europe.
She thinks for a beat, then holds the door open for the
young man.

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
Come in. Would you like some tea?

INT - MRS.HIMMELSTEIN'S APARTMENT - DAY
Donny sits on a overstuffed sofa, holding a tea cup and
saucer in his hand. Mrs.Himmelstein sits on a overstuffed
chair, holding her tea, looking across at her visitor.

DONNY
(Sipping tea)
Very good.

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
If you like tea.
Donny chuckles at her little joke. The old woman remains
stone. She wasn't joking. He places his saucer on the coffee
table and begins;

DONNY
Mrs.Himmelstein, do you have any love
ones over in Europe who your concerned
for?









33.

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
What compels you young man, to ask a
stranger such a personal question?

DONNY
Because I'm going to Europe. And I'm
gonna make it right.

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
And just how do intend to do that, Joshua?

DONNY

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
And what exactly do you intend to do
with that toy?

DONNY
I'm gonna beat every Nazi I find to
death with it.

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
I thought we were having tea together?

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
And in this pursuit, how is it that I
can be of service?

DONNY
I'm going through the neighbourhood.
If you have any love ones in Europe,
who's safety you fear for, I'd like
you to write their name on my bat.

BACK TO BASTERDS
Donny takes a long walk to Werner...
As WE CUT BACK and FORTH BETWEEN DONNY WALKING and WERNER
WAITING, WE ALSO CUT BACK and FORTE BETWEEN DONNY and

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN...

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
You must be a real BASTERD, Donny?









DONNY
You bet your sweet ass I am.

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
Good. A Basterds work is never done.
Specially in Germany.
Donny steps up to the plate, looking down at the Nazi;

DONNY
Gimmie your papers.
Werner hands Donny up his papers.
Donny RIPS the identity page out, and sticks it in his
pocket.

MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
Hand me your sword Gideon. I do believe
I will join you on this journey.

INSERT
she signs the BAT, "MADELEINE"

BACK TO BASTERDS
Donny BEATS Werner TO DEATH WITH THE BAT, to the cheers of
The Basterds.

PVT.BUTZ
watches. Hirschberg says to him;

PFC.HIRSCHBERG
About now, I'd be shittin my pants, if
I was you.
Aldo points a finger at Butzsr and crooks it toward him.

PFC.HIRSCHBERG
That means you, cup cake.
A crying, visibly shaken, Butz site down in front of Aldo.

LT.ALDO
You wanna live?

PVT.BUTZ
Yes, sir.

LT.ALDO
Point out on this map, the German
position.
His arm shoots out like a rocket, and points out the
positions.








3 s.

PVT.BUTZ
This area here.

LT.ALDO
How many?

PVT.BUTZ
Maybe twelve.

LT.ALDO
What kinda of artillery?

PVT.BUTZ
They have a machine gunn dug in here
pointing north.

HITLER
How did you survived this ordel?
WE SEE Pvt.Butz in The Fuhrer's room for the first time.
He wears a Nazi cap, which is unusual in the presence of The
Fuhrer, but he seems okay with it.

PRVT.BUTZ
They let me go.

FROM HERE ON WE GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ALDO AND HITLER.

LT.ALDO
Now when you report what happened here,
you can't tell 'em, you told us, what you
told us. They'll shoot ya. But there gonna
wanna know, why you so special, we let you
live? So tell 'em, we let ya live, so you
could spread the word through the ranks,
what's gonna happen to every Nazi we find.

HITLER
You are not to tell anybody anything!
Not one word of detail! Your outfit
was ambushed, and you got a away.
Not one word more.

PVT.BUTZ
Yes mine Fuhrer.

HITLER
Did they mark you like they did the
other survivors?









36       

PVT.BUTZ
Yes mine Fuhrer.

HITLER
Remove your hat and show me.

LT.ALDO
Now say we let ya go, and say you
survive the'war? When you get back
home, what'eha gonna do?

PVT.BUTZ
I will hug my mother like I've never
hugged her before.

LT.ALDO
Well, ain't that's a real nice boy. Are you
going to take off your uniform?

PVT.BUTZ
Not only shall I remove it, but I intend
to burn it!
The young German is telling Aldo, what he thinks, Aldo wants
to hear. But the last answer didn't go down as well as he
thought it would, evident by the frown on Aldo's face.

LT. ALDO
Yeah, that's what we thought. We don't
like that. You see, we like our Nazi's
in uniforms. That way, you can spot 'em,
just like that.
(Snaps his fingers)
But you take off that uniform, ain't
nobody gonna know you was a Nazi.
And that don't sit well with us.
Aldo removes a LARGE KNIFE from a sheath on his belt.

LT.ALDO
So I'm gonna give ya a little somethin,
you can't take off.

BACK TO HITLER
Pvt.Butz removes his combat helmet, hair hangs in his face,
his moves it aside, and WE SEE a SWASTIKA has been HAND

CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD.

BACK TO BASTERDS

BUTZ'S POV:
on ground, looking up at them. Aldo has just carved the
swastika, and he's holding the bloody knife. All The
Basterds crowd around to admire his handy work.









37.

SGT.DONOWITZ
You know Lieutenant, your getting pretty
good at that.

LT. ALDO
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall,
don't 'ch? Practice.

FADE TO BLACK

OVER BLACK

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

CHAPTER THREE

"GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS"
NOTE: This whole Chapter will be filmed in French New Wave
Black and White.

INT - CINEMA AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
We're in the auditorium of a cinema in Paris. However the
CAMERA is pointed in the direction of the audience, not the
screen. We start CLOSE on the projector beam, emanating from
the little glass window in the back of the theatre
The CAMERA continues to DOLLY back, making the Shot Wider and
Wider, bringing in more and more the German occupied citizens
of Paris, who stare at the OFF SCREEN silver screen in the dark
We can hear the OFF SCREEN SOUNDTRACK of a Goebbels produced
German omm paw paw musical movie being projected.
The Shot continues to pull further and further back, and the
German dialogue continues to fill the auditorium...

TILL...
.The DOLLY SHOT LANDS on a CLOSE UP of Shosanna,. watching the
movie.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS:

"1941

PARIS

TWO WEEKS AFTER THE MASSACRE

OF SHOSANNA'S FAMILY"
We hear the sound of the German musicals climax.
The lights go up in the auditorium.
Shosanna, dressed in a NURSES UNIFORM she swiped from
somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the PATRONS, gather
their coats, and file out.









3P.

EXT - LITTLE CINEMA (PARIS)- NIGHT
Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside
SHUTS OFF the marquees lights.
The MARQUEE READS in French:
"GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in MADCAP IN MEXICO".

EXT - PROJECTION BOOTH (LITTLE CINEMA)
A French Black Man, who we will learn later is named MARCEL,
is the cinema's projectionist. We see him for a moment, taking
the film reels off the projector, and placing them on rewinds.

INT - AUDITORIUM

CU SHOSANNA
still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is
empty.
The owner of the Cinema, a attractive looking French woman,
who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears in
one of the cinema's opera box balconies.
Looking down from her perch at the young girl, sitting in
the empty cinema.
The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH, and SUBTITLED into

ENGLISH.

MADAME MIMIEUX
So young woman, since it's beyond obvious
we're closed for the evening. I must assume
you want something. What can I do for you?

SHOSANNA
May I sleep here tonight?

MADAME MIMIEUX
So I gather your not a nurse?

SHOSANNA
No.

MADAME MIMIEUX
But your a bright little thing, that's
clever disguise. Where is your family?

SHOSANNA
Murdered.









3 1.

MADAME MIMIEUX
So your a war orphan?

SHOSANNA
We were from Nancy. The Bosch found us

MADAME MIMIEUX
Is this a sad story?

SHOSANNA
Oui.

MADAME MIMIEUX
Sad stories bore me. These days everyone
in Paris has one. I haven't bore you
with mine, don't bore me with yours.

SHOSANNA
You can run the machines?

MADAME MIMIEUX
What machines?
Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a
projector, she says;

SHOSANNA
The machines that show the film?

MADAME MIMIEUX
The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema,
of course I can operate them.

SHOSANNA
I know, I saw you.

FLASH ON:

CU SHOSANNA
eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth,
watching...

MADAME MIMIEUX
expertly working the projectors...

BACK TO SHOSANNA

SHOSANNA
Teach me. Teach me to run the machines,
that show the film. It's only you and
the negro. I know you could use some help.









40.

MADAME MIMIEUX
I know at least six people who've been
put up against a wall, and machine
gunned for sheltering enemies of the
state. I have no intention of being
unlucky number seven. How long have
you been in Paris?

SHOSANNA
A week, and a few days.

MADAME MIMIEUX
How have you survived the curfew
without capture?

SHOSANNA
I sleep on rooftops.

MADAME MIMIEUX
Again, I'm forced to admit, clever
girl. How is it?

SHOSANNA
Cold.

MADAME MIMIEUX

(LAUGHS)
I can imagine.

SHOSANNA
Respectfully, no you can't.

MADAME MIMIEUX
Fair enough.

MADAME MIMIEUX
So you can't operate a 35mm film projector,
you want me teach you, in order to work
here, in order to use my cinema, as a hole
to hide in, is that correct?

SHOSANNA
Oui.

MADAME MIMIEUX
Whats your name?

SHOSANNA
Shosanna.









MADAME MIMIEUX
I'm Madame Mimieux. You may call
me Madame. This is a cinema. Not a
home for wayward war orphans.
Having said that, what you say is true.
If you were truly exceptional, I could
find use for you. So Shosanna, are you
truly exceptional?

SHOSANNA
Oui Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX
I will be the judge of that.

DISSOLVE TO

TITLE CARD:
Which shows a lovely PENCIL SKETCH of the CITY OF PARIS,
complete with Eiffel Tower.

ABOVE IT READS:

"1944

PARIS"

THEN...
The CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we see we're not looking at a TITLE
CARD at all, but a CALENDER stuck on the wall of the Little
Cinema's Projection Booth. Before we leave it, WE SEE the
Month is JUNE.
..The CAMERA finds, the THREE YEARS OLDER SHOSANNA, working
as the PROJECTIONIST. It would appear, that Shosanna passed
Madame Mimieux's exceptional test.
A lyrical Morriconie-like tune PLAYS on the SOUNDTRACK, this
will be "Shosanna's Theme".
A Little Bell, begins RINGING, on one of the projectors,
alerting Shosanna it's time for a REEL CHANGE.
Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German film
she's projecting, waiting for the1st REEL CHANGE MARK...

SILVER SCREEN
of the little cinema. On Screen LENI REFENSHTAL lies
horizontal as a ice sickle drips on her head in the old
German film, "The White Hell Of Piza Palu",
The 1st REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the upper right
hand corner of the FRAME...(That tells the projectionist
to get ready).








As the FILM REEL on the lst PROJECTOR rolls out, Shosanna
stands ready, waiting by the 2nd PROJECTOR...

WHEN...

SILVER SCREEN
the 2nd REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the same place(That's the
one).

SHOSANNA
THROWS the lever on the 2nd PROJECTOR, switching the film from
projector 1  to projector 2 , executing a perfect REEL CHANGE.
As Shosanna's Theme plays on the Soundtrack, we watch viva
MONTAGE, her go through her daily chores. Carry heavy film cans
up the stairs, empty the rat traps, ect,ect...

EXT - CINEMA - NIGHT
The MARQUEE READS in French:
"GERMAN NIGHT LENI REFENSHTAL in PABST WHITE HELL OF PIZA PALU"
Shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of
LETTERS (for the marquee), and a tall ladder. Her chore here,
obviously, is to change the show on the marquee.
The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the Soundtrack in ENGLISH;

NARRATOR(VO)
To operate a cinema in Paris during
the occupation, one had two choices.
Ether you could show new German propaganda
films, produced under the watchful
eye of Joseph Goebbels. Or... .you
could have a German night in your
weekly schedule, and show allowed
German classic films.
Their German night was Thursday.
Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing
the letters on the marquee.
A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER(about the same age as Shosanna), walks
out of the cinema. He sees the ladder with the young French
girl on top, and walks over.
They speak FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

GERMAN SOLDIER
What starts tomorrow?
Shosanna looks down, seeing the young German Solder smiling up
at her from below.









LC 3.

SHOSANNA
A Max Linder festival.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Ummmm, I always preferred Linder to
Chaplin. Except Linder never made a
film as good as "The Rid". The chase
climax of "The Kid", superb.
Shosanna continues working, not adding to the conversation.

GERMAN SOLDIER
I suppose now you could use a "M"
a "A" and a "X"?

SHOSANNA
No need, I can manage.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Don't be ridiculous, it's my pleasure.
He hands the French damsel the letters spelling MAX.

SHOSANNA
Merci.

GERMAN SOLDIER
I adore your cinema very much.

SHOSANNA
Merci.
She busies herself with the marquee letters...

GERMAN SOLDIER

SHOSANNA

GERMAN SOLDIER

SHOSANNA

GERMAN SOLDIER
How does a young girl, such as yourself,
own a cinema?
Do to his uniform, and Shosanna's situation, all his efforts
at trying to make small talk, strikes the young Jewess in
hiding as a Gestapo interrogation.









SHOSANNA
My aunt left it to me.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Lucky girl.
Shosanna makes no reply back.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Merci for hoisting a German night.

SHOSANNA
I don't have a choice, but your welcome.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Do you chose the German films yourself?

SHOSANNA
Oui.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Then my merci stands. I love the
Refensthal mountain films, especially,
"Pizu Palu". It's nice to see a French
girl who's a admirer of Refensthal.

SHOSANNA
"Admire", would not be the adjective
I would use to describe my feelings
towards Fraulein Refensthal.

GERMAN SOLDIER
But you do admire the director. Pabst,
don't you? That's why you included
his name on the marquee.
She climbs down from the ladder and faces the German
Private.

SHOSANNA
I'm French. We respect directors
in our country.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Apparently even Germans.

SHOSANNA
Even Germans. Merci for assistance,
Private. Adieu.
She turns to go back inside.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Your not finished?









SHOSANNA
I'll finish in the morning.
She opens the door to go inside.

GERMAN SOLDIER
May I ask your name?

SHOSANNA
You wish to see my papers?
She hands him her excellently forged papers.
That's obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway
to read her name.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Emmanuelle Mimieux. That's a very
pretty name.

SHOSANNA
Merci. Are you finished with my papers?
He hands them back.

GERMAN SOLDIER
Mademoiselle. My name is Fredrick Zoller.
She gives no response.

GERMAN SOLDIER
It's been a pleasure chatting with a
fellow cinema lover. Sweet dreams,
Mademoiselle.
He gives her a little salute, and walks into the black of a
curfew imposed night.
She looks after him. She didn't show it, but he kinda got to
her. After all, for any true cinema lover, it's hard to hate
anybody who, CINEMA MON AMOUR.

EXT - ROOFTOP CINEMA - NIGHT
Shosanna stands on the roof of her cinema, late at night,
lighting up a cigarette. As she takes her first big drag,
she remembers a voice.

FLASH ON
MADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and the black
projectionist Marcel, in the projection booth. Shosanna
lights up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face
HARD, knocking the cigarette out of her mouth. Marcel
quickly STAMPS it out on the floor.








If-7.

MADAME MIMIEUX
if I ever see you light up a cigarette
in my cinema again, I'll turn you into
the Nazi's, do you understand?
Shosanna is shocked by this statement.

SHOSANNA
Oui, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX
And for bringing a open flame in my
cinema, you deserve far worse then
a Nazi jewish boxcar. With your thick
head, what do you think the highest
priority of a cinema manager is?
Keeping this fucking place from burning
down to the ground, that's what!
In my collection, I have over 350,
35mm, nitrate film prints, which are
not only immensely flammable, but
highly unstable. And should they
catch fire, they burn three times
faster then paper. If that happens..
.POOF...all gone, cinema no more,
every body burned alive. If I ever
see you with a open flame in my cinema
again, I won't turn you into the Nazi's
I'll kill you myself. And the fucking
Germans will give me a curfew pass.
Do you understand me?

SHOSANNA
Out, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX
Do you believe me?

SHOSANNA
Out, Madame.

MADAME MIMIEUX
You damn well better.

BACK TO ROOF
Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke.
Marcel comes onto the roof.

MARCEL
Are you well?









SHOSANNA
Even on the roof I can't smoke a
cigarette without hearing Madames
voice yelling at me. That's why I
do it. To hear Madames voice again.

MARCEL
We both miss her.

SHOSANNA
I know. I'm fine, darling. I'll be
to bed soon.
Marcel goes back inside, Shosanna smokes.

INT - FRENCH BISTRO - AFTERNOON
Shosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a
book, "The Saint in New York" by Leslie Charteris, drinking
wine. When the young German Private from the other day,
FREDRICK ZOLLER, walks in. He gets a beer, then notices the
French girl sitting in the back. He smiles, and heads over
to her. "Oh no, not this guy again", she thinks.
Again they speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

FREDRICK
May I join you?

SHOSANNA
Look Fredrick -

FREDRICK

(SMILING)
- You remember my name?

SHOSANNA
Yes....Look, you seem a pleasant
enough fellow -

FREDRICK
- Merci.

SHOSANNA
Your welcome. - regardless, I want
you to stop pestering me.

FREDRICK
I apologize mademoiselle, I wasn't
trying to be a pest. I was simply
trying to be friendly.

SHOSANNA
I don't wish to be your friend.









FREDRICK
Why not?

SHOSANNA
Don't act like a infant. You know why.

FREDRICK
I'm more then just a uniform.

SHOSANNA
Not to me. If you are so desperate for
a French girlfriend, I suggest you try
Vichy?
Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously
very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in
UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which nether Shosanna, or the non German
speaking members of the movies audience, can understand.
He signs autographs for them, shakes their hands, and they
go on their way.
Shosanna's eyes narrow.

SHOSANNA
Who are you?

FREDRICK
I thought I was just a uniform?

SHOSANNA
Your not just a German soldier, are
you somebodies son?

FREDRICK
Most German soldiers are somebodies son.

SHOSANNA
Yeah, but your not just somebody. What
are you, Hitlers nephew?
He leans in across the table, she leans in too, and he says;

FREDRICK
Yes.

SHOSANNA
Really?

FREDRICK
No not really, I'm just teasing you.
She leans back annoyed.

SHOSANNA
Then what is it? What are you, a German
movie star?









6'O

FREDRICK
Not exactly.

SHOSANNA
(Pfuit), what does that mean, "not exactly".
I asked if you were a movie star, the
answer to that question, is yes or no.
Fredrick laughs at that line.

FREDRICR
When you said that just now, you
reminded me of my sister.
This catches young Shosanna off guard.

FREDRICR
I come from a home of six sisters.
We run a family operated cinema in Munich.
Seeing you run around your cinema,
reminds me of them. Especially my sister
Helga. She raised me, when our father
wasn't up to the job. I admire her very
much. You'd like her, she doesn't wear a
German uniform.

SHOSANNA
You were raised by Helga?

FREDRICK
All my sisters, I'm the baby, but Helga
was the bossiest.

SHOSANNA
And your mother and father?

FREDRICK
My mother died. And my father was a
loser. My fathers moto; "If at first
you don't succeed, quit". The day he
left, good riddance. My sisters are
all I need. It's why I like your cinema.
It makes me feel both closer to them,
and a little homesick at the same time.

SHOSANNA
is your cinema still operatiing?

FREDRICR
Oui.

SHOSANNA
What's it called?









5!

FREDRICK
The Kino Haus.

SHOSANNA
How has it done durring the war?

FREDRICK
Actually, in Germany, cinema
attendance is up.

SHOSANNA
No doubt, you don't have to operate
under a curfew.

FREDRICK
How often do you fill your house?

SHOSANNA
(Pfuit), not since before the war.

FREDRICK
So if you had one big engagement, that
would help you out?

SHOSANNA
Of course, but that's not likely to
happen.
TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach
the table. They ask for Fredricks autograph, he signs it for
them. One of the French Girls says in FRENCH, how exciting
it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears
it. They leave. So that's it, she thinks.

SHOSANNA
So your a war hero? Why didn't you tell me?

FREDRICK
Everybody knows that, I liked you didn't.

SHOSANNA
What did you do?
He takes a sip of beer.

FREDRICK
I've shot the most enemy soldiers
in world war two...so far.
You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.

SHOSANNA
Wow.









52

FREDRICK
I was alone in a bell tower in a
walled off city in Russia. It was
myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo,
in a bird's nest, against three
hundred Soviet soldiers.

SHOSANNA
What's a bird's nest?

FREDRICK
A bird's nest is what a sniper would call
a bell tower. It's a high structure,
offering a three hundred and sixty degree
view. Very advantageous for marksmen.

SHOSANNA
How many Russian's did you kill?

FREDRICK
Sixty-eight.

(BEAT)
The first day. A hundred and fifty the
second day. Thirty-two, the third day.
On the forth day, they exited the city.
Naturally my war story received alot of
attention in Germany, that's why they
all recognize me. They call me the
German Sgt.York.

SHOSANNA
Maybe they'll make a film about
your exploits.

FREDRICK
Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels
thought. So he did. It's called "Nation's
Pride", and guess what, they wanted me to
play myself, so I did. They have posters
for it in kiosks all over Paris. That's
another reason for all the attention.

SHOSANNA
"Nation's Pride" is about you? "Nation's
Pride" is starring you?

FREDRICK
I know, comical, huh?

SHOSANNA
Not so comical. So what are you doing
in Paris, enjoying a rest?









53.

FREDRICK
Hardly. I've been doing publicity,
having my picture taken with different
German luminaries, visiting troops,
that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the
film to premier in Paris, so I've been
helping them in the planning.
Joseph is very keen on this film.
He's telling anybody who will listen,
when "Nation's Pride" is released,
I'll be the German Van Johnson.
Shosanna, wasn't falling for the young German, by any stretch.
However his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can't
help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as "Joseph",
like their friends, is all she needed to get on the right side
of things. This young man is trouble with a capital "T", and
she needs to stay far fucking away from him.
She abruptly rises, and says;

SHOSANNA
Well, good luck with your premier
Private. I hope all goes well for
Joseph and yourself. Au revoir.
And with that, she disappears. Leaving the perplexed private
alone.

EXT - CINEMA MARQUEE - DAY
It's the next day.
Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee.
Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet.
 hosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her
ladder.

WHEN...
.A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema.
A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back
of the sedan.
The DRIVER, a German Private, steps out as well.
Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder;
Both GERMAN and FRENCH will be SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.








5 q.

GESTAPO MAJOR
Mademoiselle Nimieux?

SHOSANNA
Oui?
Telling his Driver in German to ask her in French;

GESTAPO MAJOR
Ask her if this is her cinema?
in French The Driver asks Shosanna;

DRIVER
is this your cinema?

SHOSANNA

GESTAPO MAJOR
Tell her to come down.

DRIVER
Come down please.
She climbs down the ladder.
The Driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her
to get in.

SHOSANNA
I don't understand, what have I done?

DRIVER
(to Major)
She wants to know what she's done?

GESTAPO MAJOR
Who says she's done anything?

DRIVER
Who says you've done anything?
Then in her best imitation of Madame Mimeux's arrogantmanner.

SHOSANNA
Then I demand to know what this is about,
and where do you propose to take me?
The Driver begins to translate, when the Gestapo Major holds up his
hand, telling him not to bother. The Major looks at the young
French girl and tells her in German;









55.

GESTAPO MAJOR
Get your ass in that car.
No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car,
followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off.

INT - SEDAN(MOVING) - DAY
The Nazi sedan drives through the early afternoon Paris
streets.

WE HOLD SHOSANNA IN TIGHT CU
the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside
her. We just hold on her face trying not to revel anything.
The sedan stops.
The car door opens and the Driver offers Shosanna his hand.

EXT INT- MAXIUM'S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFE) - DAY
She steps out of the car, and is lead into a Paris cafe by the
Gestapo Officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before
she realizes she's not being led to a Gestapo interrogation
room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch.
The best table at Maxims. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it.
Germany's Minister of Propaganda, and the number two man in
Hitlers Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS, his female French translator
(and mistress), FRANCESCA MONDINO, and young Private Zoller,
are the people. TWO BLACK FRENCH POODLES, belonging to
Mademoiselle Mondino, sit together in another chair at the
table.
We join them in mid-conversation;
They all speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

GOEBBELS
- it's only the off spring of slaves that
allows America to be competitive athletically.
America olympic gold can measured in Negro
sweat.
Shosanna is lead through the French eatery by the Gestapo Major.
Private Zoller see's her, and stands up, excuse's himself,
and greets her before she reaches the table.
Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

FREDRICK
Good you came. I wasn't sure weather or
not you'd except my invitation.









SHOSANNA
Invitation?

THEN...
.Goebbles Voice says OFF SCREEN;

GOEBBLES(OS)
Is that the young lady in question,
Fredrick?
Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the
arm, and leads her to him.

FREDRICK
Yes it is, beer Goebbels. Emmanuelle,
there is somebody I want you to meet.
Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French
girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons creme brule into his mouth.
The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda
minister formally.

FREDRICK
Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to
introduce you to the minister of
propaganda, the leader of the entire
German film industry, and now I'm a
actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.
Goebbels offers up his long spider-like fingers for Shosanna to
shake. She does.

GOEBBELS
Your reputation precedes you Fraulein
Mimieux.
He looks to Francesca to translate, but she's just taken a big
bite of terri misu.
They all laugh.
Fredrick jumps in...

FREDRICK
And normally, this is beer Goebbels French
interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca
Mondino.

FRANCESCA
looks up at Shosanna.









5'?
NARRATOR'S VOICE comes on soundtrack;

NARRATOR (VO)
Francesca Mondino is much more then
Goebbels French Interpreter.
She's also Goebbels favorite French
actress to appear in his films...

FLASH ON:

FILM CLIP
from one of Francesca's B W Goebbels produced productions.
Francesca, dressed as a French peasant girl, with a YOUNG

GERMAN (MOVIE) SOLDIER.
She speaks in FRENCH, SUBTITLED in to ENGLISH;

FRANCESCA PEASANT GIRL
I love you, I can't help it. My country
or my heart, which do I betray?
A SUBTITLE APPEARS below naming the films title;

"SENTIMENTAL COMBAT" (1943)

FLASH ON
Francesca and Goebbels having sex in her boudoir, on her red
velvet bed.

NARRATOR (VO)
And Goebbels favorite French Mistress,
to act in his bed.
WE SEE JUST A SUPER QUICK SHOT OF Goebbels FUCKING Francesca

DOGGY STYLE.

FRANCESCA

(ANIMAL-LIKE)
Do it! Do it! Fuck me - fill me!

BACK TO FRANCESCA
looking at Shosanna.

FRANCESCA
Bon jour.

SHOSANNA
Bon jour.









I
f.

FREDRICK
And you've met the Major.
The Gestapo officer steps up and says, to Fredrick in German;

GESTAPO MAJOR
Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
(to Shosanna)
Major Deiter Helistrom of the Gestapo, at
your service mademoiselle.
(he clicks
his heels)
Please allow me, have a seat.
The Gestapo Officer pulls out a chair, for the young lady to sit
down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is
Private Zoller. To her left are the two curly pampered
poodles. Major Helistrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine
from a small craft on the table.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Try the wine mademoiselle, it's quite good.
Goebbels looks across the table at her.

GOEBBELS
well I must say, you've made quite a
impression on our boy.
Francesca interprets Goebbels German for Shosanna.

GOEBBELS
I must say fraulein, I should be rather
annoyed with you.
Francesca interprets..

GOEBBELS
I arrive in France, and I wish to have
lunch with my star...
Francesca interprets...

GOEBBELS
Little do I know Be's become
the toast of paris, and now he
must find time for me.
Francesca interprets...








c9        

GOEBBELS
People wait in line hours, day's,
to see me. For the Fuhrer and
Private Zoller, I wait.
Francesca interprets...

GOEBBELS
So finally, I'm granted a audience
with the young Private, and he spends
the entire lunch speaking of you
and your cinema.
Francesca interprets...

GOEBBELS
So Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down
to business.
Private Zoller interrupts -

FREDRICK
- Heer Goebbels, I haven't informed
her yet.

GOEBBELS
Unless the girls a simpleton, I'm
sure she's figured it out by now,
after all she does operate a cinema.
Francesca, tell her.
Francesca tells Shosanna in French;

FRANCESCA
What they're trying to tell you
Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has
spent the last hour at lunch,
trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels
to abandon previous plans for Private
Zollers film premier, and change the
venue to your cinema.
Zoller reacts.

FRANCESCA

(FRENCH
to Zoller)
What?

FREDRICK
I wanted to inform her.

FRANCESCA
Shit. I apologize Private, of
course you did.









60.

GOEBBELS

(GERMAN
to Francesca)
What's the issue?

FRANCESCA
The Private wanted to inform the
mademoiselle himself.

GOEBBELS
Nonsense. Until I ask a few
questions, he has nothing to inform.
Let the record state, I have not
agreed to a venue change.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Duly noted.
Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna;

GOEBBELS
You have opera boxes?

SHOSANNA

GOEBBELS

SHOSANNA

GOEBBELS
More would be better. How many
seats in your auditorium?

SHOSANNA
Three hundred and fifty.

GOEBBELS
That's almost four hundred less
then The Ritz.
Fredrick jumps in...

FREDRICK
But beer Goebbels, that's not such
a terrible thing. You said yourself
you didn't want to indulge every
two faced french bourgeois taking
up space currying favor. With less
seat's it makes the event more
exclusive. Your not trying to fill
the house, their fightin g for seats.









61.

FREDRICK

(CON'T)
Besides, to hell with the French.
This is a German night, a German
event, a German celebration. This
night is for you, me, the German
military, the high command, their
family and friends. The only people
who should be allowed in the room,
are people who will be moved by
the exploits on screen.
Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause;

GOEBBELS
I see your public speaking has
improved. It appears I've created
a monster. A strangely persuasive
monster. When the war's over,
politics awaits.
Table chuckles.

GOEBBELS
Well Private, though it is true,
I'm inclined to indulge you anything.
I must watch a film in this young
ladies cinema before I can say,
yes or no.
(to Shosanna)
So young lady, you are to close
your cinema tonight, and have
a private screening me.
Francesca interprets...

GOEBBELS
What German films do you have?
Francesca asks..

SHOSANNA
My cinema , on German night, tends
to show older German classics.
Francesca interprets...

GOEBBELS
Why not my films?
Francesca asks...









6Z.

SHOSANNA
I draw a older German audience in
my cinema, that appreciate the
nostalgia of the earlier time.
Francesca interprets...

GOEBBELS
That's nonsense fraulein. Us Germans
are looking forward, not backwards.
That era of German cinema is dead.
The German cinema I create, will not
only be thee cinema of Europe. But
the worlds only alternative to the
degenerate Jewish influence of
Hollywood.
Fredrick Jumps in...

FREDRICK
Along with being a cinema owner,
Emmanuelle is quite a formidable
film critic.
He chuckles, but alone.

GOEBBELS
WSo it would appear. Unfortunately
for the fraulein, I've outlawed
film criticism.
Zoller, thinking fast, says;

FREDRICK
Why don't you screen "Lucky Kids"?
I'm sure Emmanuelle hasn't seen. it.
And it's so funny, I've been meaning
to recommend it to her, for her
German night. That's a great idea,
let's watch "Lucky Kids" tonight.

GOEBBELS
Ahhh, "Lucky Kids", "Lucky Kids",
"Lucky Kids". When all is said and
done, my most purely enjoyable
production. Not only that, I
wouldn't be surprised, if sixty
years from now, It's "Lucky Kids"
that I'm the most remembered for.
I know it doesn't seem like it now,
but mark my words.
Very well, I'll have a print sent
over to the fraulein'.s cinema.
We'll screen "Lucky Kids" tonight.









63
As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna...
...the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly
filled with the bottom half of a grey S.S. officer uniform.

GOEBBELS
Ah Landa, your here, this is the
young lady in question.
The S.S. Officer sits down, and it's our old friend from the
first scene COL HANS LANDA.

FREDRICK
Shosanna, this4pol Hans Landa of
the SS., he'll be running security
for the premier.

CU SHOSANNA
A bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes. But if she
gives any indication of this, her war story ends here.
The S.S. OFFICER
that murdered her family, takes her hand and kisses it,
saying in perfect French;

COL LANDA
Charmed Mademoiselle.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Better known as "The Jew Hunter".
The table laughs.

GOEBBELS
Oh Francesca, what was that funny
thing the Fuhrer said about Hans?

FRANCESCA
What thing?

GOEBBELS
You know, you were there, it was a
funny thing the Fuhrer said,
about Hans...Something about a pig?
Francesca's memory is jogged.

FRANCESCA
Oh, yes of course.
She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels ear.









6 "F

GOEBBELS
Oh, yes of course, that's it. So
the Fuhrer said, he wouldn't be
surprised if Hans weren't rooting
out Jews like a truffle pig from
the play pen.

FRANCESCA
That's what we need, pigs that can
root out Jews.

COL LANDA
Who needs pigs when you have me?
Big hearty laugh around the table.

GOEBBELS
Do you have a engagement tonight?

COL LANDA
Well, as a matter of fact, I do -

GOEBBELS
- Break it. We're all going to the
Fraulein's cinema tonight to view
"Lucky Kids".

COL LANDA
Splendid.
Then Reich Ministers companion mademoiselle Mondino,

INTERRUPTS;

FRANCESCA
And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels
to his next appointment.

GOEBBELS
Slave driver! French slave driver!
They all chuckle.
Everybody begins to stand up from the table...
..Francesca gathers the stupid dogs...
.as Col Landa stands, he says;

COL LANDA
Actually, in my role as security
chief of this joyous German occasion,
I'm afraid I must have a word with
Mademoiselle Mimieux.









C. 5.
Mademoiselle Mimieux eyes go to Private Zoller, who responds.

FREDRICK
What sort of discussion?

COL LANDA
That sounded suspiciously like a
Private questioning the order of a
Colonel? Or am I just being sensitive?

FREDRICK
Nothing could be further from the
truth Colonel. Your authority is
beyond question.
But your reputation does proceed
you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux
or myself be concerned?

GOEBBELS
Hans, the boy means no harm, he's
simply smitten. And he's correct.
Your reputation does proceed you.
Laughter all around. The Reich Minister and his axis entourage,
make their way to front of the cafe, with the two dumb dogs on
a leash, leading the way.

COL LANDA
No need for concern, you two.
As security chief, I simply need
to have a chat with the possible
new venue's property owner.

FREDRICK
I was just hoping to escort
Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her
cinema.

GOEBBELS
Nonsense! You can eat ice cream,
and walk along the Sienne another
time. Right now, allow Col Landa
to do his job.
Everybody saystheir farewells.
Col Landa offers the young jew in hiding a seat at a small
table in the outside patio area of Maxims.
The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. jew hunters
french, revels to the audience, that his feigning clumsiness at
french with Monsieur Lapadite in the films first scene, was
simply a interrogation-technique.








bd.
They speak FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

COL LANDA
Have you tried the strudel here?

SHOSANNA
No.

COL LANDA
It's not so terrible. So how is it
the young Private and yourself came
to be acquainted?
She's about to answer, when a WAITER approaches.

COL LANDA
Yes, two strudels, one for myself,
and one for the mademoiselle. A cup
of espresso, with a container of.
steamed milk, on the side.
For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.
Considering Shosanna. grew up on a dairy farm, and the last time
she was on a dairy farm, her strudel companion murdered her
entire family, his ordering her milk is, to say the
least... . disconcerting.
The key to Col Landa's power, and or charm, depending on the
side ones on, lies in his ability to convince you he's privy to
your secrets.

COL LANDA
So Mademoiselle, you were beginning
to explain....?

SHOSANNA

(ANXIOUSLY)
Up untill a couple of days ago,
I had no knowledge of Private Zoller,
or his exploits. To me, the Private
was simply just a patron of my cinema.
We spoke a few times, but -

COL LANDA
- Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
This is a simple formality, no
reason for you to feel anxious.
The Colonel takes one look at it, and says to the Waiter;









67

COL LANDA
I apologize, I forgot to order the
cream fresh.

WAITER
One moment.
He exits.

COL LANDA
(Refuring to
the apple pie)
Wait for the cream.
(Back to

BUSINESS)
So Emmanuelle - May I call you
Emmanuelle?

SHOSANNA
Oui.

COL LANDA
So Emmanuelle, explain to me how
does it happen, that a young lady
such as your self, comes to own a
cinema?
The Waiter returns, applying cream fresh to the two strudels.
The S.S. Colonel looks across the table at his companion, picking
up his fork, he says;

COL LANDA
After you.
Shosanna takes        a whip creamy bite of strudel, Landa follows her
lead.

COL LANDA

(MOUTHFULL
of pie)
Success?
Shosanna, mouth full of pie, indicates she approves.

.COL LANDA
Like I said, not so terrible.
(Back to

BUSINESS)
So you were explaining the origin of
your cinema ownership?









69.

SHOSANNA
The cinema originally belonged to
my aunt and uncle -
Col Landa removes alittle black book from his pocket.

COL LANDA
- What is there names?

SHOSANNA
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
He records the names in his little book.

COL LANDA
Where are they now?

SHOSANNA
My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg.

COL LANDA
Pity... . Continue.

SHOSANNA
Aunt Ada passed away from fever
last spring.'

COL LANDA
Regrettable.

(RESPECTFUL

PAUSE)
It's come to my attention you have
a negro in your employ, is that true?

SHOSANNA
Yes, he's a Frenchman. His name is
Marcel. He worked with my aunt and
uncle since they opened the cinema.
He's the only other one who works
with me.

COL LANDA
Doing what?

SHOSANNA
Projectionist.

COL LANDA
Is he any good?

SHOSANNA
The best.









61.

COL LANDA
Actually one could see where that
might be a good trade for them.
Can you operate the projectors?

SHOSANNA
Of course I can.

COL LANDA
Knowing the Reich Minister as I do,
I'm quite positive he wouldn't want
the success or failure of his
illustrious evening, dependent on
the prowess of a negro. So if it
comes to pass we hold this event
at your venue, talented no doubt,
as your negro may be, you will
operate the projectors. Is that
exceptable?
As if she has any say.

SHOSANNA
Oui.
Col Landa takes another bite of strudel, Shosanna follows suit.

COL LANDA
So it would appear our young hero is
quite smitten with you?

SHOSANNA
Private Zollers feelings for me
aren't of a romantic nature.

COL LANDA
Mademoiselle...?

SHOSANNA
Colonel, his feelings are not
romantic. I remind him of his sister.

COL LANDA
That doesn't mean his feelings
aren't romantic.

SHOSANNA
I remind him of his sister who
raised him.









70

COL LANDA
It's sounding more and more romantic
by the minute.
Landa takes out a handsome looking cigarette case, with a S.S.
LOGO on it. Removing on of the fags, he lights it up with a
fancy S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.

COL LANDA
Cigarette?

SHOSANNA
No thank you.

COL LANDA
Do you smoke?

SHOSANNA
Yes.

COL LANDA
Then I insist, you must take one.
There not French, there German.
I hope your not nationalist about
your tobacco, to me French cigarettes
are a sin against nicotine.
She takes one, but makes no move to light it.
He inhales deep, and says;

COL LANDA
I did have some thing else I wanted
to ask you, but right now, for the
life of me, I can't remember what it
is. Oh well, must not of been important.
Col Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table,
puts on his grey S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor,
saluting Shosanna, and saying:

COL LANDA
Till tonight.
And with that he's gone.
Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief.
The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet
ankles and floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine.
During her conversation and strudel with the man that
exterminated her entire family, shosanna pissed herself.
She drops the German cigarette in to the piss puddle by her
feet.









7 1.

INT - CINEMA AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
The SILVER SCREEN
on screen is the German screwball comedy "LUCKY KIDS".
We hear OFF SCREEN laughter at the on screen aryan antics.

CU GOEBBELS
Watching the screen, basking in his own toxic genius.

CU FRANCESCA
Laughing at the comedy, hand covering her mouth.

CU TWO BLACK POODLES
Pantingly watching the screen.

CU MAJOR HELLSTROM
Smiling, smoking a French cigarette.

CU COL LANDA
Smoking his calabash, amused.

CU FREDRICK ZOLLER
Truly enjoying himself.

CU SHOSANNA
watching the screen.
The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.

NARRATOR (VO)
While Shosanna sits there pretending
to be amused by the aryan antics of
Goebbels Frank Capra copy, "Lucky
Kids", a thought suddenly comes to
her.
We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes.

NARRATOR (VO)
What if tonight, accidently, the
cinema burned down? The Third Reich
would lose it's Minister of
propaganda, it's national hero, and
it's top jew hunter, all in one fell
swoop.
She chuckles at the thought, though it looks like she's
laughing at the German comedy.

SILVER SCREEN
"The END" card for "Lucky Kids" is projected.
The Nazi rouges gallery, and Shosanna, applaud the film.









IZ
The lights go up.

P
Goebbels excepts congratulations, as they stand and begin to
file out into the lobby.

NARRATOR(VO)
The screening of "Lucky Kids" was a
complete success. And Heer Goebbels
conceded to have the venue changed
to Shosannas cinema. Not only that,
in a moment of inspiration, Heer
Goebbels had a idea.
Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca translates;

GOEBBELS
I must say, I appreciate the modesty
of this auditorium. Your Cinema
has real respect, almost church like.
Not to say we couldn't spruce the
place up a bit. In Versailles
there's a crystal chandelier hanging
in the banquet hall that is
extraordinary. we're going to get it,
and hang it from the very middle of
auditorium roof. Also I want to go to
Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes,
and just scatter them about the lobby.

MONTAGE
we see a quick series of shots that show all that happening.
The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles.
Greek nude statues being hand trucked out of the Louvre.
A truck driving through the french countryside with the
enormous crystal chandelier in the back.
The lobby of Shosanna's cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography.
WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are moved
into place.
We see Workers trying with incredible difficulty, to hoist the
huge, heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier, in Shosannas
auditorium, which now resembles something out of one of Tinto
Brass's Italian B-movie rip off's of Visconti's "The Damned".

SHOSANNA
watches all this from a opera box, she shakes her head in
disbelief.









73

BACK TO SHOSANNA AND THE NAZI "S
in the lobby, post screening of "Lucky Rids", she's soundlessly
escorting them to the door, as they make their goodbyes.

NARRATOR (VO)
As they left the little French
cinema that night, all the Germans
were very happy...
We see Private Zoller hanging back, so he.can say goodbye.

NARRATOR (VO)
None more so then Private Zoller.
She closes the door on him. Watching the Nazi's walk into the
Paris night. Their shadows, for a moment onAwall, look
like grotesque Nazi charcthers. 4644
The Nazi's are gone.
Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking
down at Shosanna.
They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

MARCEL
What the fuck are we suppose to do?

SHOSANNA
It looks like we're suppose to have
a Nazi premier.

MARCEL
Like I said, what the fuck are we
suppose to do?

SHOSANNA
Well, I need to speak with you
about that.

MARCEL
About what?

SHOSANNA
About these Hun swine, commandeering
our cinema.

MARCEL
What about it?
She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part
his legs, and sits on the lower step, between his legs. Her
back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders.
Shosanna has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel.









SHOSANNA
Well, when I was watching the bosch
(Said in

ENGLISH)
Capra-corn abomination,
(Back to

FRENCH)
I got a idea.

MARCEL
I'm confused, what are we talking
about?

SHOSANNA
Filling the cinema with Nazi's and
their whores, and burning it down
to the ground.

MARCEL
I'm not talking about that, your
talking about that.

SHOSANNA
No, we're talking about that,
right now. If we can keep this
place from burning down by
ourselves, we can burn it down
by ourselves.

MARCEL
Shosanna -

SHOSANNA
No, Marcel, just for sake of argument,
if we wanted to burn down the cinema,
for any number of reasons, you and I
could physically accomplish that, no?

MARCEL
Oui Shosanna, we could do that.

SHOSANNA
And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate
film print collection, we wouldn't
even need explosives, would we?

MARCEL
You mean we wouldn't need any more
explosives?

SHOSANNA
Oui, that's exactly what I mean.
She begins kissing his hands.









75.

SHOSANNA

(CON'T)
I am going to burn down the cinema
on Nazi night.
One of his fingers probes her mouth.

SHOSANNA

(CON'T)
And if I'm going to burn down the
cinema, which I am, we both know,
your not going to let me do it
by myself.
The back of her head presses up hard against him, as his hand
both caresses, and grips her lovely neck.

SHOSANNA

(CON'T)
Because you love me. And I love you.
And your the only person on this earth
I can trust.
She then TWISTS around, so she's straddling him. They are now,
face to face.

SHOSANNA

(CON'T)
But that's not all we're going to do.
Does the filmmaking equipment it the
attic still work? I know the film
camera does. How about the sound
recorder?

MARCEL
Quite well, actually. I recorded a
new guitarist I met in a cafe last
week. It works superb. Why do we
need filmmaking equipment?

SHOSANNA
Because Marcel, my sweet, we're
going to make a film. Just for the
Nazi's.

FADE TO BLACK









?G.

FADE OFF

INT - ENGLISH COUNTRY ESTATE - DAY
A young MILITARY ATTACHE, opens the sliding double doors
that serve as a entrance to the room.

MILITARY ATTACHE
Right this way, Lieutenant.
A snappy handsome British Lieutenant in dress browns, steps inside
the room. This officer, who has been mixing it up with
the Gerrys since the late thirties, is named LT.ARCHIE HICOX.
A young George Sanders type(The Saint and Private affairs of
Bel Ami, years).
Upon entering the room, Lt.Hicox is gobsmacked.
Standing before him is legendary military mastermind,
GENERAL ED FENECH, a older George Sanders type (Village of the
Dammed).
But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano,
smoking his ever present cigar, is the unmistakable
bulk of WINSTON CHURCHELL.

LT. HICOX
Lt. Archie Hicox, reporting sir.

GEN FENECH
(Salutes back)
General Ed Fenech, at ease Hicox.
Drink?
Hicox's eye's go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano,
who's scrutinizing him behind his cigar. However the man behind
the cigar makes no gesture, and the General, makes no
acknowledgment of the three hundred pound gorilla in the room.
Which Lt.Hicox knows enough to mean, if Churchell isn't
introduced, he ain't there.

LT.HICOX
if you offered me a scotch and plane
water, I could drink a scotch and
plain water.









?7.

GEN.FENECH
That a boy, Lieutenant. Make it
yourself, like a good chap,
will you? Bars in the globe.
Hicox heads over to the bar globe.

LT.HICOX
Something for yourself, sir?

GEN.FENECH
Whiskey straight. No junk in it.
The Lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar, and
busies himself mixing spirits, playing bartender chappy.
Fenech, eyeing the Lieutenant's file.

GEN.FENECH
It says here you've run three
undercover commando operations in
Germany, and German occupied
territories? Frankfaurt, Holland,
and Norway to be exact?
Back to them, mixing drinks, he says;

LT.HICOX
Extraordinary people, the Norwegian's.

GEN.FENECH
It says here you speak German fluently?

LT.HICOX
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.

GEN.FENECH
And your occupation before the war?
His back still to us, as he bartends...

LT. H I COX
I'm a film critic.

GEN.FENECH
List your accomplishments?

LT.HICOX
Well sir, such as they are, I write
reviews and articles, for a publication
called; "Films and Filmmakers".
As well as our sister publication.








7f .

GEN.FENECH
What's that called?

LT.HICOX
"Flickers Bi-Monthly". And I've had
two books published.

GEN.FENECH
Impressive. Don't be modest Lieutenant,
what are their titles?

LT. HI COX
The first book was called; "Art Of The
Eye's, The Heart, and The Mind:A Study
of German Cinema in the Twenties".
And the second one was called; ...
He turns around with his whiskey and plain water, and the
Generals whiskey no junk. He finishes what he was saying, as
he walks toward the General, handing him his drink.

LT.HICOX
"Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci".
It's a subtexual film criticism
study of the work of German director
G.W. Pabst.

LT. HI COX
What should we drink to, sir?

GEN.FENECH
(Thinking, for
a moment)
Down with Hitler.

LT.HICOX
All the way down, sir.

GEN.FENECH
Are you familiar with German cinema
under the Third Reich?

LT. HI COX
Yes. Obviously I haven't seen any of
the films made in the last three
years, but I am familiar with it.

GEN.FENECH
Explain it to me.?









77

LT.HICOX
Pardon sir?

GEN.FENECH
This little escapade of ours,
requires a knowledge of the German
film industry under the Third Reich.
Explain to me UFA, under Goebbels?

LT.HICOX
Goebbels considers the films he's
making to be the beginning of a new
era in German cinema. A alternative
to what he considers the Jewish
German intellectual cinema of the
twenties. And the Jewish controlled
dogma of Hollywood.
SUDDENLY... Bellowing from the back of the room;

CHURCHELL
How's he doing?

LT. H I COX
Frightfully sorry sir, once again?

CHURCHELL
You say he wants to take on the Jews
at their own game? Compared to say
.Louis B.Mayer...how's he doing?

LT.HICOX
Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels
has taken over, film attendance has
steadily risen in Germany over the
last eight years. But Louis B.Mayer
wouldn't be Goebbels proper opposite
number. I believe Goebbels see's himself
closer to David O.Selznick.
Gen.Fenech looks to the Prime Minister.
With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchell says;

CHURCHELL
Brief him.

GEM.FENECH
Lt.Bicox, at this point in time I'd
like to brief you on, Operation Kino.
Three days from now, Joseph Goebbels is
throwing a gala premier of one of his
new movies in Paris -









80.

LT.HICOX
- What film sir?
The General has to resort to peeking at his file.

GEN.FENECH
The motion pictures called; "Nation's
Pride".

LT.HICOX
Oh, you mean the film about Private
Zoller?

GEN.FENECH
We don't have any intelligence, on
exactly, what the film that night
will be about.

LT.HICOX
But it's called "Nation's Pride"?

GEN.FENECH
Yes.

LT.HICOX
I can tell you what it's about,
it's about Private Fredrick Zoller.
He's the German Sgt.York.
Fenech can't help suppress a smile, they have the right man.

GEN.FENECH
In attendance at this joyous Germatic
occasion, will be Goebbels, Gerring,
Boorman, and most of the German High
command, including all high ranking
officers of both The S.S., and, The
Gestapo. As well as luminaries of the
Nazi propaganda film industry.

LT.HICOX
The master race at play, aye?

GEN.FENECH
Basically, we have all our rotten
eggs in one basket. The objective of
Operation Kino.... Blow up the basket.

LT.HICOX
(Reciting a
a poem)
"...and like the snows of yesteryear,
gone from this earth". Jolly good, sir.









GEN.FENECH
An American Secret Service outfit,
that lives deep behind enemy lines,
will be your assist. The Germans call
them; "The Basterds".

LT.HICOX
"The Basterds", never heard of them.

GEN.FENECH
Whole point of the secret service,
old boy, you not hearing of them.
But the Gerrys have heard of them,
because these yanks have been them
the devil. Their leader is a chap
named Lt.Aldo Raine. The Germans
call him, "Aldo the Apache".

LT.HICOX
Why do they call him that?

GEN.FENECH
Best guess, is because he removes the
scalps of the Nazi dead.

LT.HICOX
Scalps, sir?

GEN.FENECH
The hair.
He runs his finger along his hairline.

GEN.FENECH
Like a red Injun.

LT.HICOX
Rather gruesome sounding little
Dicky bird, isn't he?

GEN.FENECH
No doubt the whole lot, a bunch a
nutters. But you've heard the
expression, "It takes a thief".

LT.HICOX
Indeed.
General Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over
to a military map.








9i.

GEN.FENECH
You'll be dropped into France, about
twenty four kilometers outside of Paris.
The Basterds will be waiting for you.
First thing, you go to a little village
called, "Nadine".
(He points it
out on the map)
Apparently the Gerrys never go there.
In Nadine, there's a tavern, called,
"La Louisiane", you'll rendez-vous
with our double agent, and she'll take
it from there. She's the one who's
going to get you in the premiere.
It will be you, her, and two German
born members of the Basterds. She's
also made all the other arrangements
your going to need.

LT.HICOX
How will I know her?

GEN.FENECH
I suspect that won't be too much
trouble for you. Your contact is
Bridget Von Hammersmark.

LT.HICOX
Bridget Von Hammersmark? The German
movie star is working for England?

GEN.FENECH
For the last two years now. one could
even say Operation Kino was her
brainchild.
In the back of the room the bulldog barks;

CHURCHELL
Extraordinary women.

LT.BICOX
Quite.

GEN.FENECH
You'll go to the premiere as her
escort, lucky devil. She'll also
have the premiere tickets for the
other two. Got the gist?

LT.HICOX
I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.
The three British bulldogs laugh.









9 3

EXT - CINEMA ROOFTOP - DAY
Shosanna and Marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema,
literally, making a movie.
Marcel is behind a old (even then) BOLEX 35MM MOVIE CAMERA,
positioned low looking up.
Shosanna, the camera subject, stands on boxes looking down
into it.
A old timey MICROPHONE is positioned out of frame.
As they always do, and always will, they speak FRENCH
SUBTITLED into you know what.

MARCEL
We need a sync mark.

SHOSANNA
What is a sync mark?

MARCEL
A action and noise put together,
So we can sync up the picture
and sound.

SHOSANNA
How do we do that?

MARCEL
Clap your hands.
She does.

MARCEL
In frame imbecile.
She claps her hands in front of her face.

MARCEL
Ready?
Shosanna takes a deep breath, then;

SHOSANNA
Ready.

MARCEL
Action.

WE CUT BEFORE SHE SPEAKS TO...









GIR

.THE SCENE EARLIER BETWEEN MARCEL AND SHOSANNA IN THE

LOBBY, ON THE STAIRS, TALKING ABOUT BURNING DOWN THE CINEMA.
Big diffrence this time, it's in COLOR.

MARCEL
But how do we get it developed?
Only a suicidal idiot like us would
develop that footage. How do we get
a35mm print with a soundtrack?

SHOSANNA
Do you know one person who can do
both things?

MARCEL
Of course Gaspar, very nice man,
took care of all the experimental
filmmakers. But nobody in their
right mind would strike a print of
what your talking about. If the
Nazi's found out, their life wouldn't
be worth this.
He snaps his fingers.

SHOSANNA
In a wolf fight, you ether eat the
wolf, or the wolf eats you. If we're
going to obliterate the Nazi's,
we have to use their tactics.

MARCEL
What does that mean?

SHOSANNA
We find somebody who can develop
and process a35mm print. And we
make them do it, or we kill them.
Once we tell them what we want to
do, if they refuse, we have to kill
them anyway, or they'll turn us in.

MARCEL
Would you do that?

SHOSANNA
Like that.
Snaps her fingers.









?S,

INT - SMALL FILM PROCESSING LAB- LATE NIGHT
A old mom and pop film processing lab circa the Thirties.
Late late at night.
GASPAR, the fatherly figure of all the experimental French
filmmakers in the decade before German rule, takes a SAVAGE
BEATING at the hands of his friend Marcel.
Shosanna watches, pitiless.

SHOSANNA
Bring that fucker over here!
Put his head down on that table.
Marcel, holds his arm behind him, as he forces his head flat
against the table top.
Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP into the table, just by
his face.

SHOSANNA
You ether do what the fuck we tell
you to, or I'll bury this axe in your
collaborating skull.

GASPAR
I'm not a collaborator!

SHOSANNA
Then prove it! Or does your manhood
go no deeper, then standing to piss?
Marcel, does his wife, and children
know you?

MARCEL
Oui.

SHOSANNA
Then after we kill this dog for
Germans, we'll go and silence them.
She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high...

SHOSANNA
Prepare to die, collaborator fucker!

CUT TO

GASPAR
hands the couple a SMALL SILVER CAN OF 35mm FILM. Outside
the shop window, it's morning.









INT - PROJECTION BOOTH-
WE SEE the five heavy silver film cans of Fredrick Zollers
life story "Nations Pride"(clearly marked) on the floor of
the projection booth.
The can for REEL 4is open and empty.
Shosanna's at the editing bench, REEL 4, is up on the
rewinds...
Shosanna SPLICES her and Marcels footage into REEL 4 of
Fredricks film. Rewinds it, puts it back in the can, and
puts a piece of RED TAPE on REEL 4 CAN.
She walks out of the booth, turning off the lights behind
her, PLUNGING THE SCREEN INTO DARKNESS.

BLACK FRAME

FROM BLACK DISSOLVE TO

EXT - LA LOUISIANE (TAVERN) - NIGHT
We see a small basement tavern, with a old rustic sign out
front that reads, "La Louisiane".

A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
"The Village of

NADINE, FRANCE"
TWO SHOT LT.HICOX and LT.ALDO RAINE
Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a
German grey S.S. Cap't uniform. They look out of a window, in a
apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern.

LT.ALDO
You didn't say the goddamn rendez-vous
was in a fuckin basement.

LT.HICOX
I didn't know.

LT.ALDO
You said it was in a tavern?

LT.HICOX
it is a tavern.









LT.ALDO
Yeah, in a basement. You know,
fightin in a basement offers a lot
of difficulties, number one being,
your fighting in a basement.
Wilhelm Wicki, joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S.
Lieutenant uniform.

WICKI
What if we go in there, and she's
not even there?

LT.HICOX
We wait. Don't worry, she's a British
spy, she'll make the rendez-vous.
WE SEE the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes,
are in the room as well, they are, Donowitz, Hirschberg,
and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the grey
uniform of a S.S. Lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself,
sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt looped around his
boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterds opening
chapter, is dead.
Lt.Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of
the room, SHARPENS his dagger menacingly.
.Stiglitz is fucking werid...
Lt.Hicox approaches Stiglitz...

LT.NICOX
Stiglitz, right?

STIGLITZ
That's right, sir.
He continues bringing the blades edge, up, then, down on the
leather strap.

LT.HICOX
I hear your pretty good with that?
Meaning the blade. Stiglitz doesn't answer.

LT.HICOX
You know, we're not looking for
trouble, right now. We're simply
making contact with our agent.
Should be uneventful. However, on
the off chance I'm wrong, and things
prove eventful. I need to know, we can
all remain calm.









99.
The renegade Gerry Sergeant, stops his blades progress, and
looks up at the limy Lieutenant.

STIGLITZ
I don't look calm to you?

LT.HICOX
Well, now you put it like that,
I guess you do.
He turns his attention back to his blade.
Hicox moves over to Aldo, and asks him privately;

LT. HI COX
This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz?
Not exactly the loquacious type,
is he?
Aldo just looks at him.

LT.ALDO
Is that the kinds man you need, the
loquacious type?

LT.HICOX
Fair point, Lieutenant.

LT.ALDO
So y'all git in trouble in there,
what are we suppose to do?
Make bets on how it all comes out?

LT.HICOX
If we get into trouble, we can
handle it. But if trouble does
happen, we need you to make damn
sure no Germans, or French, for
matter, escape from that basement.
If Frau Von Hammersmark's cover is
compromised, the mission is kaput.

SGT.DONOWITZ
Speaking of Frau Von Hammersmark,
who's idea was it for the death trap
redez-vous?

LT.HICOX
She chose the spot.

SGT.DONOWITZ
Well isn't that just dandy?









LT.HICOX
Look, she's not a military strategist.
She's just a actress.

LT.ALDO
Ya don't got to be Stonewall
Jackson to know you don't want to
fight in a basement.

LT.HICOX
She wasn't picking a place to fight.
She was picking a place, isolated,
and without germans.

PFC.HIRSCHBERG
Lieutenant, I hate to be contrary,
but I got me a Nazi pissin on
Louisianna two-o'clock.
They move to the window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI
PRIVATE, relieves himself against the side wall.
Lt.Bicox, this was definitely, not the plan.

LT.HICOX
Shit.
Sgt.Donowitz chides him;

SGT.DONOWITZ
So what do you think your fraulein
Von Hammer -

LT.HICOX
- Obviously, I don't know,Sgt.
The British officer watches the German soldier, who's not
suppose to be there. When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the
window. Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger
in hand.

STIGLITZ
If we're going, let's go.
He sheaths the dagger.

EXT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN) - NIGHT
The GERMAN PISSING PRIVATE, sloppily finishes his task.
Craming his noodle back in his pants, he descends the stairs
that lead him back into the basement tavern. We Follow him...







INT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)- NIGHT
.Inside the basement tavern, La Louisiane. it has a very low
hanging basement ceiling. A old looking wood bar off to the
right. And the only other space in the little tavern, is taken
up by two large(at least in here) tables, which take up both
half's of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of
the two tables, is completely filled with drunken celebrating
Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of
five.

FIVE NAZI'S
ONE GERMAN MASTER SGT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SGT (a powerfully built
stocky type), and THREE MALE GERMAN PRIVATES.
The Five Nazi's are sitting around the table, drinking, and
playing a very fun game with none other then the fraulein of
the hour, UFA diva, BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK. Dressed to the
nines in a chic Forties style women's suit, complete with
fedora. The game their playing consists of each player having
a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary,
stuck to their forehead. The player doesn't know what name is
on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure
out who they are.
The Five Germans, five cards read; MASTER SGT  1(POLA NEGRI),

FEMALE SGT  2(BEETHOVEN), GERMAN PRIVATE  3(MATA HARI),

GERMAN PRIVATE  4 (EDGAR WALLACE), GERMAN PRIVATE  5
(WINNETOU). And Bridget Von Hammersmark, who wears her card in
the brim of her fedora, has GENGHIS KHAN.
It's German 5 (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions.
The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN, and SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.
Also, while some dialogue will be written for the German
Soldiers, it will be mostly made up from the exuberance
of their game playing, and celebrating.

WINNETOU
.okay, I'm not German. Am I American?
The whole table bursts out laughing.

FEMALE SGT BEETHOVEN
Yes you arel

EDGAR WALLACE
Well, not really.

SGT.POLA NEGRI
What do you mean, not really? Of
course he is.









91

EDGAR WALLACE
Well if he's so American, how come
he's never been translated into
English? He's not American. He's
suppose to be American, but he's not
a American creation. In fact, he's
something very different.

WINNETOU
Okay, I'm a fictional, literary
character, from the past, I'm American,
and that's controversial.

BRIDGET GENGUS
No it's not controversial. The nationally
of the author, has nothing to do with
the nationally of the character.
The Character is the character.
Hamlet's not British, he's Danish.
So yes, this character was born in
America.

WINNETOU
Well I'm glad that's settled. If I had
a wife, would she be called a squaw?
He's got it.
The table Laughs.
The TABLE

YES!

WINNETOU
Is my bloodbrother, Old Shatterhand?
The TABLE
Yes!

WINNETOU
Did Karl May write me?
The TABLE
Yes!
In the BACKGROUND, WE SEE, our three counterfeit German
Officers, Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz, enter the basement
tavern. They obviously. see the five German soldiers, but their
too far away for us (the audience) to read their face. No
doubt their less then happy. Fraulein Von Hammersmark
see's them as well. Without getting up, she waves to them.









QZ

BRIDGET
Hello, my lovelies, I will join you
in moments. I'm finishing up a game
with my five new friends here.

LT.HICOX
No hurry, Frau Von Hammersmark.
Take your time, enjoy yourself.

BRIDGET
(To Winnetou)
So who are you?

WINNETOU
I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES!
The table CHEERS, and APPLAUD the Apache Chief, as he takes
the card off his forehead.
The other Four German Soldiers drink down there beer(part of
the game).
Bridget Von Hammersmark knock backs her champagne.

MATA HARI
Frau Von Hammersmark, when your
friends came in, did you realize
you did a double take, like in the
movies?

BRIDGET
Really? No, I wasn't aware of that
at all.

MATA HARI
They must be second nature to you now?
Did they teach you how to do a double
take in the movies?

BRIDGET
Well, yes they did, but it's not really
that difficult.

SGT.POLA NEGRI
Do one for us.
The Tableheartily agrees.
Bridget looks directly at the Master Sgt, and does a perfect,
and perfectly funny, Double Take.
The Table loves it.








q3.

MATA HARI
My turn, I want to try.
Mata Hari, looks directly at Beethoven, and does a Double
Take.

EDGER WALLACE
I want to try.
He does.
Soon the whole Table is doing dueling Double Takes.

HICOX - WICKI - STIGLITZ
watch the table do dueling Double Takes. Obviously, they don't
understand.

THEN...
.Bridget Von Hammersmark rises, and excuses herself from the
Table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at
the name Gengus Khaun for the first time.

BRIDGET
Gengus Khaun! I would never of gotten that.
She walks over, and joins the masquerading Germans table, the
Gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a french cheek
kiss, as if she knows them well.
They all take a seat. The two Basterds, and one Brit, drink
Whiskey. The taverns PROPRIETOR, a older, big bellyed
Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table, and pours more
champagne into Bridget's Champagne glass. He leaves, returning
back behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other
person in the establishment.
Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

LT.HICOX
I thought this place was suppose to
have more French then Germans?

BRIDGET
Normally that's true. The Sgt over
there's wife, just had a baby. His
commanding officer gave him, and his
mates the night off to celebrate.

WICXI
We should leave.









BRIDGET
F No, we should stay. For one drink at
least. I've been waiting for you in a
bar, it would look strange if we left
before we had a drink.

LT.HICOX
She's right, just be calm, and enjoy
your booze.

BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE
The French Barmaid, has taken Bridget's place in the rousing,
rowdy game. She tells them, her person must be French, or she
won't know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a
name on a card. The Barmaid puts it on her forehead, It says;

NAPOLEON.
The Germans all laugh.

BACK TO THE BASTERDS TABLE

BRIDGET
There's been some new developments.
The cinema venue has changed.

LT.HICOX
Why?

BRIDGET
No one knows. But that in itself
shouldn't be a problem. The cinema
it's been changed to is considerably
smaller then The Ritz. So whatever
materials you brought for The Ritz,
should be doubly effective here.
Now this next piece of information
is colossal, try not to over react.
The Fubrer, will be attending tomorrow.
Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT TAKE.
Bridget's eyes bore holes in him.

BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS
They see Hugo do the spit take, and burst out laughing.
Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit takes, like they
did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all
get wet.









9

BACK TO BASTERDS

BRIDGET
(To Hicox)
You'll be going as Ernst Schuller.
You'll say your a associate producer
on Riefenstahl's "Tiefland". It's the
one German production not under Goebbels
control, and Leni wouldn't be caught dead
at a Goebbels film affair.

BACK TO REAL GERMAN TABLE
Master Sgt.Pola Negri, drinks his beer, as he looks over,
dreamily, at Bridget Von Hammersmark at the other table.

BACK TO BASTERDS
We See in Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity.
the B.G., the German Master Sgt stand up from his table, and
head toward Fraulein Von Bammersmark.

BRIDGET
.the films gone through many delays,
and Leni's heath is deteriorating, so
if you have to speak...
Hicox, seeing the German Master Sgt approach, signals for her
to cool it.

SGT.POLA NEGRI
Frau Von Hammersmark, I was just
thinking, could you sign a autograph
to my son on his birthday?

BRIDGET
I'd love to Wilhelm.
(To the Table)
This handsome happy Sgt, just became
a father today.
The Pretend Officers offer congratulations to the Sgt.
The German Master Sgt, CLICKS his heels, and bows before his
superior officers.

SGT.POLA NEGRI
Thank you, heil Hitler.
He raises his hand .... as do the seated phony officers; "Heil
Hitler".
As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch..

BRIDGET
So Wilhelm, do you know the name of
this progeny yet?









SGT.POLA NEGRI
I most certainly do, fraulein. His
name is Maximilian.
Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz, likes this German Sgt.

STIGLITZ
Wonderful name, Sgt.

SGT.POLA NEGRI
Thank you, Lieutenant. When he's old
enough to ride a bicycle, I will buy
him a blue one. And I will paint on
the side "The Blue Max".
He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheers.
They do.
Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.

BRIDGET
There you go. But wait, I'm not finished yet.
She reaches into her clutch, and pulls out some lipstick.
Applies some ruby red color to her lips, and then kisses the
napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then hands the treasured
item to the young father.

BRIDGET
Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.

SGT.POLA NEGRI
Thank you fraulein, thank you. Max may
not know who you are now. But he will.
I will show him all of your movies.
He will grow up with your films,
and this napkin on his wall.
Then, to the whole tavern...

SGT.POLA NEGRI
I purpose a toast to the greatest actress
in Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is
no Riefenstahl, only Von Hammersmark!
The whole room toasts.
This would be a good time for the German Sgt to go back to his
table, and his men. And he almost does.... but... since he is
drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome.

SGT.POLA NEGRI
So, Frau Von Hammersmark, what brings
you to France?









97 .
Feeling any good Nazi officer's patience would of been
exhausted long ago, Lt.Hicox butts in.

LT.HICOX
None of your business,Sgt.
You might not have worn out your welcome
with the fraulein, with your drunken
boorish behavior, but you have wore out
your welcome with me.
The Table of game playing Soldiers, hear this, and get quiet.

LT.HICOX
Might I remind you Sgt.,your a enlisted
man. This is a officers table. I suggest
you stop pestering the fraulein, and
rejoin your table.
The German Master Sgt., looks quizzically at the officer.

SGT.POLA NEGRI
Excuse me Cap't, but your accent is
is very unusual.
The whole room pauses-for different reasons...

SGT.POLA NEGRI
Where are you from?
A silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two
German born impostors spring into action.

WICKI
Sgt.! You must be ether drunk or mad,
to speak to a superior officer with
such impertinentness!
Stiglitz, STANDS and YELLS to the other table;

STIGLITZ
I'm making YOU,...
(Pointing at

WINNETOU)
.and YOU,..
(Pointing at
Edgar Wallace)
.responsible, for him.
(Pointing at
Sgt.Pola)
I suggest you take hold of your friend,
or he'll spend Max's first birthday
in jail for public drunkenness!









78
The Germans SPRING UP, and take hold of Sgt.Pola...

1W

WHEN...
A GERMAN VOICE rings out;

GERMAN VOICE (OS)
Then might I inquire?
The Five known Germans move aside, reveling the unknown German
in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before
MAJOR DEITER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO. The Major stands from
the little table he was sitting at.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Like the young newly christened father,
I too have a acute ear for accents.
And like him, I too find yours odd.
From where do you hail, Cap't?
Wicki jumps in;

WICKI
Major, this is highly inappr -

MAJOR HELLSTROM
T wasn't speaking to you
Lt.Saltzberg,
(Turning to

STIGLITZ)
or you ether, Lt.Berlin.
(Looking at

HICOX)
I was speaking to Cap't I--don't-know-what.
The Gestapo Major is now standing beside Sgt.Pola, before the
impostors table.
Lt.Hicox, calmly explains his origin.

LT.HICOX
I was born in the village that rests
in the shadow of Piz Palu.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
The mountain?

LT.HICOX
Yes. In that village we all speak like
this. Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Yes.








f q s

LT. HICOX
Then you saw me. You remember the skiing
torch scene?

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Yes I do.

LT.HICOX
In that scene was myself, my father,
my sister, and my two brothers. My
brother is so handsome, the director
Pabst, gave him a Close Up.
As Bridget Von Hammersmark places a cigarette in a ivory
cigarette holder, which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her,
she says;

BRIDGET
Major, if my word means anything, I can
vouch for everything the Young Cap't has
just said. He does hail from the bottom
of Piz Palu, he was in the film,
and his brother is far more handsome
then he.
The impostors laugh.
Then....so does the Gestapo Major. He turns to the Sgt.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
You should rejoin your friends.
Which the young Sgt is more then happy to do. That table
begins playing there game again.
Major Hellstrom, the highest ranking officer in the room, bows
graciously to the female German celebrity.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
May I join you?

BRIDGET
By all means, Major.
The Gestapo Major sits at the table, opposite Lt.Hicox, and
Wicki. The French Barmaid brings over the Majors beer stein.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
So that's the source of your bazaar
accent? Extraordinary. So what are
you doing here Cap't?

LT.HICOX
Aside from having a drink with the lovely
fraulein?









,00 .

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Well that pleasure requires no explanation.
Chuckle...Chuckle

MAJOR HELLSTROM
I mean in country. Your obviously not
stationed in France, or I'd know who
you are.

LT         I'! I COX
You know every German in France?

MAJOR BELLSTROM
Worth knowing.

LT.HICOX
Well, there in lies the problem. We
never claimed to be worth knowing.
Chuckle... Chuckle.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
(Chuckling as
he asks)
All levity aside, what are you doing
in France?

LT.HICOX
Attending Goebbels film premiere as
the frauleins escort.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Your the frauleins escort?

LT.HICOX
Somebody has to carry the lighter.
Chuckle chuckle.

BRIDGET
The Captain is my date, but all three
are my guests. We're old friends Major,
who go back along time. Longer then
a actress would care to admit.
Chuckle chuckle.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Well, in that case, let me raise a glass
to the three luckiest men in the room.

BRIDGET
I'll drink to that.









101
They cheers.

BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLE
They continue to have alot of fun playing their game.

BACK TO OFFICERS TABLE

MAJOR HELLSTROM
I must say, that game their playing
looks like a good bit of fun. I didn't
join them, because your quite right Cap't,
officers and enlisted men shouldn't
fraternize. But seeing as we're all
officers here,
(Bowing to

BRIDGET)
.and sophisticated lady friends of
officers. What say we play the game?
Lt.Hicox begins to refuse, when Bridget (feeling she knows
better), interrupts him;

BRIDGET
okay, one game.

MAJOR HELLSTROM

WUNDERBAR
The Major borrows five cards from the other table, and lays
them out in front of Bridget and the officers.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
So the object of the game, is to write
the name of a famous person on your card.
Real or fictitious, doesn't matter. For
instance, you could write Confucius or
Fu Manchu.
(He SNAPS his

FINGERS)
Eric' More pens.
(Back to players)
And they must be famous. No Aunt Inga's.
When you finish writing, put the card
face down on the table, and move it to
the person to your left. The person to
your right, will move their card in
front of you. You pick up the card
without looking at it, lick the back,
and stick it on your forehead like so.
He demonstrates.








)oz.

MAJOR HELLSTROM

(CON'T)
And in ten yes or no questions, you must
guess who you are...
As Major Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the
game, The CAMERA PANS OFF HIM, and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO
STIGLITZ. The Majors dialogue begins to FADE AWAY.
Untill we're in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED
FILTERED FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody
wearing a GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSE UP.
The Flashback disappears. It's driving Stiglitz crazy, being
this close to a Gestapo uniform, and not plunging a knife into
it.
The Majors Voice comes back on the soundtrack.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
.So let's give it a try, shall we?
Everybody write your names.
The Five players write their names...
Then move their cards to the right...
Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead...

No.

MAJ.KING KONG
Am I a American?
They laugh - but then Wicki says;

WICKI
Wait a minute, he goes to

BRIDGET
Don't be ridiculous, obviously he wasn't
born in America.

MAJ.KING KONG
So... . I visited America, aye?
The Table says; "Yes".

MAJ.KING KONG
Was this vist...fortuitous?

WICKI
Not for you.

MAJ.KING KONG
.Bummm. My native land, is it what
one would call, exotic?
The Table confers, and decides, yes it is exotic.

MAJ.KING KONG
Hummmm. That could be ether a reference
to the jungle, or the Orient. I'm going
to let my first instinct take over, and
ask, am I from the jungle?
The Tablesays; "Yes you are".

MAJ.KING KONG
Now gentlemen, around this time you could
ask, weather your real or fictitious.
I however, think that's too easy, so I
won't ask that, yet. Okay, my native land
is the jungle? I visited America, but my
visit was not fortuitous to me, but the
implication is that it was to somebody
else. When I went from the jungle to
America,... .Did I go by boat?
"Yes".

MAJ.KING KONG
Did I go against my will?
"Yes".

MAJ.KING KONG

"Yes".

MAJ.KING KONG
Am I the story of the Negro in America?
The Table says, "No".

MAJ.KING KONG
Well then I must be King Kong.
Be throws the card on the table.
They applaud him.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Nov since I answered correctly, you all
need to finnish your drinks.
The three counterfeit Nazi's knock back their whiskey.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Now, who's next?

LT.HICOX
Major, I don't mean to be rude. But the
four of us are very good friends. And
the four of us haven't seen each other
in quite a while. So...
Major, I'm afraid, you are intruding.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
I beg to differ Cap't. It's only if the
fraulein considers my presence a
intrusion, that I become a intruder.
How about it fraulein? Am I intruding?

BRIDGET
Of course not, Major.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
I didn't think so. It's simply the young
Cap't is immune to my charms.
The Table's not sure what to do, is this a confrontation?
Then, the Major laughs.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
I'm just joking, of course I'm intruding.









MAJOR HELLSTROM
Allow me to refill your glasses gentlemen,
and I will bid you and the fraulein adieu.
(Leaning in)
Eric has a bottle of thirty-three year old
single malt scotch whisky from the
Scottish highlands. What do you say
gentlemen?

LT.HICOX
Your most gracious, sir.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Eric, the thirty-three, and new glasses!
You don't want to contaminate the thirty-
three with the swill you were drinking.

ERIC
How many glasses?

LT.HICOX
Five glasses.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Not me. I like scotch, scotch doesn't like
me.

BRIDGET
Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.
Lt.Bicox, hold up three fingers(pinky to index), to Eric the
owner.

LT.HICOX
Three glasses.
Eric brings the three glasses, and the old bottle, pouring for
the three soldiers.
Major Helistrom lifts up his beer stein, and toasts;

MAJOR HELLSTROM
To a thousand year Reich!
They all mutter, "a thousand year reich", and toast glasses.
The Gestapo Major puts down his beer stein, and then WE HEAR a
CLICK, under the table.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Did you hear that? That's the sound of
my Luger pointed right at your testicles.









!Q(        

LT.HICOX
Why do you have a Luger pointed at my
testicles?

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Because you've just given yourself
away, Cap't. Your no more German then
that scotch.

LT.HICOX
Well, -Major -

BRIDGET
- Major -

MAJOR HELLSTROM
- Shut up slut.
(To Hicox)
You were saying?

LT.HICOX
I was saying that makes two of us. I've
had a gun pointed at your balls since
you sat down.

SGT.STIGLITZ
That makes three of us.

UNDERTABLE
We See all three guns pointed at appropriate crotches. As well
as Bridget's legs, right besides the Nazi Major's. Her pretty
gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible crossfire.

SGT.STIGLITZ
And at this range, I'm a real
Fredrick Zoller.
Hugo alsobrings out his dagger, and sitcks it in the table top.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Hummmmm ... Looks like we have a bit
of a sticky situation here.

LT. H ICOX
What's going to happen, Major, is your
going to stand up, and walk out that
door with us.

MAJOR HELLSTROM
No no no no no no, I don't think so.
I'm afraid you and I both know, no matter
what happens to anybody else in this room,
the two of us aren't going anywhere.









"7 .

MAJOR HELLSTROM
(pointing behind
him at the table)
Too bad about them though. They seem
like a likeable
(referring to
Stiglitz and Wicki)
You two will have to shoot them.

BRIDGET
Then Major, i implore you. For the
sake of those German troops, will
you please leave with us?

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Oh Bridget, your concern for German
troops, gets me
(Pointing at
his heart)
.right here. You mean for the sake
your whore legs, don't you? You can't
afford to get any bullet holes in them,
your not finished spreading them for
all the Hollywood Jews.
Lt.Hicox picks up his thirty-three year old single malt
scotch, and says;

LT.HICOX

(ENGLISH)
'Well, if this is it old boy, I hope
you dont mind if I go out speaking
the kings?

MAJOR HELLSTROM

(ENGLISH)
By all means, Cap't.
The English film critic, commando, picks up the thirty-three
the Nazi Major bought him, and says;

LT.HICOX
There's a special rung in hell reserved
for people who waste good scotch.
And seeing as I might be rapping on
the door momentarily...
He downs the stuff.

LT.HICOX
(To the Nazi

MAJOR)
I must say, damn good stuff, sir.








He puts the glass down.

LT.HICOX
Now about this, "Pickle", we find

only thing left for you to do.

MAJOR HELLSTROM

(ENGLISH)
And what would that be?

LT.HICOX
Stiglitz.

STIGLITZ
Say, auf wiedersehen to your balls!

STIGLITZ
FIRES into HELLSTROM'S BALLS...
As does HICOX, HITTING not only Hellstrom, but BRIDGET as
well.

HELLSTROM
FIRES into HICOX'S BALLS and KNEE CAPS.

STIGLITZ
then JUMPS over the table, and begins STABBING HELLSTROM with the

DAGGER.
HICOX FALLS to the floor....DEAD.
BRIDGET FALLS to the floor.,SHOT.

FIRING across at The GERMANS at the table, who unaware, were

SGT.POLA NEGRI
FALLS to the floor in the confusion.

young German Sgt, with the machine gunn.
WE HEAR the feet of the soldiers outside, reach the basement
entrance.
The door opens...
, .The German Sgt, sends FIFTY BULLETS in the doors
direction...
No one goes through it.
What we have here, is a rabbit hole like situation. No one
inside is getting out, no one outside is getting in.
The young German Sgt, YELLS in ENGLISH, to the outside;

GERMAN SGT
You outside! Who are you? British,

Aldo's Voice YELLS down the hole;

Okay, talk!

GERMAN SGT
I'm a father! My baby was born today
in Frankfurt! Five hours ago! His name
is Max! We were in here drinking and
celebrating! They're the ones that
came in shooting and killing!
It's not my fault!








Ito.

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Okay, okay, it wasn't your fault!
What's your name soldier?

GERMAN SGT
Wilhelm!

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
That's the same name as one of the
guys you just killed!

WILHELM
They attacked us!

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Okay Wilhelm... .is anybody alive
on our side?

WILHELM
No!
We hear a VOICE OFF SCREEN, yell out;

BRIDGET'S VOICE(OS)
I'm alive!
Wilhelm spins in the direction of the voice.

STILL

R
On the floor, with a bullet in her BLOODY LEG, lies the
alive Bridget Von Hammersmark.
The German Sgt points the muzzle of the machine gunn at
the German celebrity; with hate in his eyes.

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Who's that?

WILHELM
(To BRIDGET,

LOW)
Make a sound whore, and I spit!
Meaning the muzzle.

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Wilhelm, who is that?

WILHELM
is the girl on your side?
Pause.

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Which girl?









WILHELM
1 Who do you think, Von Hammersmark!

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Yeah, she's oar's!

WILHELM
(To Bridget
LOW in GERMAN)
I thought so. So you run with the
American's now, huh? Now times are
bad?

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Is she okay?

WILHELM
(To Bridget
LOW in GERMAN)
You despicable traitor.
(To Aldo)
She's been shot, but she's alive.
(To Bridget
LOW in GERMAN)
For now.
We hear The Basterds Curse their luck Off Screen.

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Okay Wilhelm, what'd ya say we
make a deal?

WILHELM
What's your name?

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Aldo. Wilhelm, can I call yap Willi?

WILHELM
Yes.

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
So Willi, you know we could lob three
or four or five or six grenades down
there, and your little war story ends
here. But good fer you, bad fer her,
you die, she dies. So what say we
make a swap?

WILLI
Keep talking?









112.

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Okay, Willi here's my deal! You let
me and one of my men come down to
take the girl away! And we take the
girl, and leave! That simple, Willi!
You go your way, we go ours! And little
Max, gets to grow up playing catch with
his daddy! So what'ya say, Willi, we
got a deal?
Willi thinks...
Bridget watches Willi think...

WILLI
Aldo?

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
I'm here Willi!

WILLI
I want to trust you.... But howcanI?

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
What choice ya got?

WILLI
I could kill the girl!

ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
Well now, Willi, that's true enough.
But something you need to know, so
you don't get the wrong idea. Ain't
none of us give a fuck bout that
girl. But, admittedly, if you kill
her, it would fuck up our plans. But
you'll be dead by then anyway, so
what'd you care? And lets not
forget that little gatzenjammer
Max, growin up without a pop. So in
the spirit of gettin you home to
him, we got a deal, Willi?

WILLI
Okay Aldo, I'm going to trust you!
Come down, no guns!
Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands.
Willi keeps his machine gunn trained on them.
Aldo with his hands up, says;

A









ALDO
Hey Willi, what's with the machine
gunny I thought we had a deal?

WILLI
We do have a deal, now git the girl
and go.

ALDO
Not so fast, Willi, we only have a
deal, we trust each other. A Mexican
stand off ain't trust.

WILLI
You need guns on me for it to be
a Mexican stand off.

ALDO
you got guns on us, you decide to
shoot, we're dead. Up top, they got
grenades, they drop 'em down here,
your dead. That's a Mexican stand
off, and that wasn't the deal.

WILLI
Just take that fucking traitor, and
go! See? Now your down here
Now you get tricky - t

ALDO
- No tricks!- Ain't nobody gittin
tricky, Willi; I swear to god, I'm
too damn dumb toget tricky. But

(MEANING

HIRSCHBERG)
him and I lived upto the deal. We
came down without guns. Now it's
your turn. No trust,no deal.
Willi pointing gunn at them.,,, -thinking...

ALDO
i know your scarred. I'm scarred,
he's scarred, we're all scarred.
So what's it gonnabe Willi?
Ether we got a deal, or you might
as well just shoot us now.
Willi decides...
He puts the machine gunn down on the bar.









WILLI
Fine. Take that fucking traitor and
get her out of my sight.

ALDO
Danka, Willi, danka. okay, Hirschbeg,
you grab her shoulder -

WHEN...
From behind Aldo and Hirschberg, Bridget lifts up Major
Hellstroms Luger, and EMPTIES the remaining bullets into
Sgt.Willi, who FALLS to the floor, DEAD.
Aldo and Hirscberg spin around shocked.

ALDO
You fuckin bitch! I had a deal with
that man!
From the floor, the bloody, sweaty, and in excoriating pain
(she'll probably lose that leg), German movie star, says to the
two American soldier's she's just meeting for the first time;

BRIDGET
He was a enemy soldier, who knew who
I was. He couldn't live.

Hirscberg loses control, and RICKS the woman on the floor,
hard in the side.

HIRSCHBERG
I ought'a beat your fuckin head in

ALDO
Stop it. Just pick her up, and get
that bitch outta here.

HIRSCHBERG
Aldo, she just-

ALDO
- She's right.

HIRSCHBERG
What?

I said, she's right. He was a Nazi
soldier. If he lived, he would doomed
the mission.

WHEN...
OFF SCREEN the sound of a DOOR BEING KICKED OPEN...
r .The SOUND of what sounds like EIGHT DOGS BARKING .... and the
sound of FEET RUNNING TOWARDS US...
.his bedroom door, is THROWN OPEN, and Sgt.Donowitz RUSHES
IN, grabbing the Old Man in his bed, and putting a
45Automatic to his head.

What? What's happening?
head, shocking, Donny SLAMS the 45. hard against the Old Man's
scarring, and bringing the old gent to attention.

SGT.DONOWITZ

(ENGLISH)
Doctor? Are you a fucking doctor?
He nods his head, yes.

SGT.DONOWITZ
Andi amo...








Donny YANKS DRAGS the Old Man out of bed, in his almost
comical nightshirt (which makes him cuter, thus the brutality
against him hurts more) towards the door...

INT - DOCTORS EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT
.Into a doctors examining room, built into a French country
house, with a examining table, and medical instruments.
However, it's obviously the medical examining room
of a veterinarian.
Along the walls are different cages with eight excited BARKING
dogs in it.
The Soldiers are putting the shot in the leg, bleeding, and in
excruciating pain, Bridget on the examining table.
Donny, still holding on to the Old Man, points in the girls
direction...

SGT.DONOWITZ

(ENGLISH)
She's been shot. Shot. Bang bang...
(pointing at
his leg)
.in leg...understand?

OLD MAN

No no no, I don't speak English.
Donny jams the barrel of his 45. into the thigh of the Old Man.

The Old Man nods his head yes.

It's still a doctor. If he can get
a bullet out of a cow, he can get
a bullet outta you.

LT.ALDO
Right now, we just need morphine.
Donny yells at the Old Man;

SGT.DONOWITZ
Morphine! We need morphine!
The Old Man tries to explain in French, that he's not a human
doctor...

WHEN...
..Donny takes the 45. and SHOOTS one of the DOGS in the
cages.
Everybody jumps.
Donny SCREAMS at the Old Man;

SGT.DONOWITZ

MORPHINE!!!

BANG
He SHOOTS another dog...

INT - LA LOUISTANE- NIGHT
Were back in the basement tavern. Colonel Hans Landa stands
over the corpse. He moves over to the next corpse, a smile
breaks out on his face.
He says in GERMAN SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

Ahhh Hugo, you've moved up in the
world I see. Lieutenant. And with
your record of insubordination.
Truly remarkable.

A Nazi soldier named HERRMAN, joins the S.S. Officer.

COL.LANDA
And that ones...
(Pointing at

WICKI)
.name is Weiheim Wicki. Bets
Austrian born jew, who immigrated
to the United States when things
began turning sour for the Israelites.
They are the two German born members of
The Basterds. They've been known
to don german uniforms, to ambush squads.

FLASH ON
Three Nazi Soldiers walking towards a company of other German
Soldiers. The Three Soldiers backs are to us. Dried bloody
bullet holes cover the backs of the three uniforms.
The SGT of the German company, yells to the trio;

SGT.GERMAN COMPANY
What brings you all the way out here?
The TRIO MOW DOWN the GERMAN COMPANY with their machine gunns.

BACK TO LANDA

COL LANDA
But that doesnt look like this.
This is odd.
Looking down he see's something...
.bending down, he examines fraulein von Hammersmarks two
pretty dress shoes lying on the floor.
One shoe is covered in blood.
The other, while blood speckled, is fairly clean.
Picking up the clean shoe, and holding it in his hand.

COL.LANDA
It would appear somebodies missing.
Somebody fashionable.
A OFF SCREEN SOLDIER'S VOICE cries out;

SOLDIERS VOICE(OS)
Col, this ones still alive!
We follow Hans to the spot on the floor where Sgt.Willi lies.
He's shot in the chest, but it looks like Max's daddy is still
alive.

INT - EXAMINING ROOM -     NIGHT
Bridget on the examining table, post morphine shot.
The other Basterds in the room watch Aldo interrogate the
German lady.

LT.ALDO
Now 'fore we yank that slug outta ya,
you need to answer a few questions

BRIDGET
Few questions about what?

LT.ALDO
About I got three men dead back there,
and why don't you try tellin us what
the fuck happened?

BRIDGET
The British officer blew his German
act, and a Gestapo Major saw it.

LT.ALDO
'fore we get into who shot John,
why did you invite my men to a
rendez-vous in a basement with a bunch
of Nazis?

BRIDGET
I can see, since you didn't see
what happened inside, the Nazi's
being there must look odd.

LT.ALDO
Yeah, we gotta word for that kinda
odd in English, it's called,
suspicious.

BRI DGET
Don't let your imagination get the
better of you, Lieutenant. You met
the sergeant, Willi. He had a baby
tonight. His commanding officer gave
him and his friends the night off to
celebrate. The Germans being there
was just a tragic coincidence.
Aldo thinks for a moment...

LT. ALDO
Okay, I'll buy that. He was ether
there with his men waiting for us,
or he was there celebrating his
sons birthday, he wasn't doin both.









120.

LT.ALDO
How did the shootin start?

BRIDGET
The English man, gave himself away.

LT. ALDO
How did he do that?

BRIDGET
He ordered three glasses.
She holds up three fingers, index to pinky.

BRIDGET
We order, three glasses.
She holds up three fingers, thumb to index.

BRIDGET
That's the German three. The other
is odd. Germans would, and did notice it.

LT. ALDO
Okay, let's pretend there were no
Germans, and everything went exactly
the way it was suppose to. What would
of been the next step?

BRIDGET
Tuxedos. To get them into the
premiere, wearing military uniforms,
with all the military there, would
of been suicide. But going as
members of the German film industry,
they wear tuxedos, and blend in with
everybody else. I arranged a tailor
to fit three tuxedos tonight.

LT.ALDO
How did you intend to get them into
the premiere?

BRIDGET
Hand me my purse.
They do. And she opens it, and takes out three tickets to the
film premiere.

BRIDGET
Lt.Hicox was going as my escort.
The other two were going as a German
cameraman and his assistant.









INN     

LT. ALDO
Can you still get us in that
premiere?

BRIDGET
Can you speak German better then your
friends, no. Have I been shot, yes.
I don't see me tripping the light
fantastique up the red carpet any
time soon. Least of all by tomorrow
night.

(PAUSE)
However, there's something you don't
know. There's been two recent
developments regarding Operation
Kino. One, the venue has been
changed from The Ritz, to a much
smaller venue.

LT.ALDO
Enormous changes at the last minute?
That's not very Germatic. Why the
hell is Goebbels doin stuff so damn
peculiar?

BRIDGET
It probably has something to do with
the second development.

LT. ALDO
Which is?

FLASH ON
IN A PRIVATE DINNING ROOM IN GERMANY, The FUHRER, aka Adolph
Hitler, aka Adolph Shicklegroover, aka The Bohemian Corporal,
having dinner with Goebbels, only a few short days ago.
The FUHRER

(GERMAN)
I've been rethinking my position in
regards to your Paris premiere of
"Nations Pride". As the weeks have
gone on, and the Americans are on
the beach, I do find myself thinking
more and more about this Private
Zoller. This boy has done something
tremendous for us. And I'm beginning
to think my participation in this
event could be meaningful.

BACK TO BRIDGET

BRIDGET
The Fuhrer's attending the premiere.









1 2 Z.
Donny breaks the teams silence;

SGT.DONOWITZ
What?

LT.ALDO
When the hell did this happen?

BRIDGET
The venue change, two weeks ago.
The Fuhrer's attendance, four days
ago.

LT. ALDO
And how come London don't know
nothing about that?

BRIDGET
We need to get something straight,
once and for all. Everything London
knows, it learned from me. If I
don't know, London doesn't know.
So now, this is me, informing you,
Hitler's coming to Paris.

SGT.DONOWITZ

FUCK A DUCK?
Aldo stands up from the chair, pacing as he takes in this new
information.

BRIDGET
What are you thinking?

LT.ALDO
I'm thinking getting a wack at
plantin ole Uncle Adolph makes
this a horse of a different color.

BRIDGET
What's that suppose to mean?

LT.ALDO
It means, your gettin us in that
premiere.

BRIDGET
I'm going to probably end up losing
this leg, bye bye acting career,
fun while it lasted. How do you
expect me to walk up a red carpet?









X73

LT.ALDO
The doggie docs gonna dig that slug
outta your gam. Then he's gonna wrap
it up in a cast, and you gotta good
how I broke my leg mountain climbing
story. That's German, ain't it?
Y'all like climbin mountains,
don'tch?

BRIDGET
I don't. I like smoking, drinking,
and ordering in restaurants, but I
see your point.

LT. ALDO
We fill ya up with morphine, till
it's comin out ya ears. Then just
limp your little ass up that
rouge car-pet.

BRIDGET
Splendid. When the Nazi's put me up
against a wall, it won't hurt
so much.
(Changing tone)
I know this is a silly question
before I ask it, but can you
American's speak any other language
then English?

HIRSCHBERG
Other then Yiddish?

BRIDGET
Preferably.
Donny referring to Aldo and himself.

SGT.DONOWITZ
We both speak alittle Italian.

BRIDGET
With a atrocious accent, no doubt.
But that doesn't exactly kill us
in the crib. Germans don't have a
good ear for Italian. So you mumble
Italian, and brazen through it, is
that the plan?

LT. ALDO
That's about it.









BRIDGET
That sounds good.

LT. ALDO
it sounds like shit, but what else
we gonna do, go home?

BRIDGET
No, it's good. If you don't blow it,
with that, I can get you in the
building.
(Change tone)
So, who does what?

LT.ALDO
Well I speak the most Italian, so
I'll be your escort. Donowitz speaks
the second most, so he'll be your
Italian cameraman. And Hirschberg
third most, so he'll be Donnys
assistant.

HIRSCHBERG
I don't speak Italian.

LT. ALDO
Like I said, third best. Just keep
your fuckin mouth shut. In fact why
don't you start practising, right now.

BRIDGET
(Meaning Utivich)
What about the little one?

UTIVICH
Do you mean me?

BRIDGET
I didn't mean any offence.

UTIVICH
None taken you German cunt.

LT.ALDO
Utivich is the chauffeur.

UTIVICH
I can't drive.
Bridget SCREAMS in frustration;

BRIDGET
You Americans are fucking useless!









UTIVICH
IVGimmie a break, I'm from Manhattan.

LT.ALDO
No worries, son. We got over fourteen
hours before the movie tomorrow.
More then enough time for you to learn
to drive.

UTIVICH
NO no no no, Lieutenant, it's not!

LT.ALDO
Oh yes yes yes yes, Private, it is.
And yes yes yes yes, you will.
(Changes tone)
Look Utivich, you and I both know,
if we went to grade school together,
you damn sure ain't copyin off of my
test. Well I lern't to drive in four
hours on a Tennessee mountain road.
And I'm a shit for brains coal miner
bootlegger. Hirschberg, you know how
to drive, right?

HIRSCHBERG
Yes.

LT.ALDO
Teach 'em.

BRIDGET
But there is a problem. I'm a movie
star. This is a movie premiere.
I can't show up looking like I was
just in a Nazi gun fight. Now I
have a dress for the premiere at my
hotel. But sometime tomorrow, I
have to get my hair done.
All The Basterds, except Donny, burst out laughing.

LT. ALDO
Sister, you must got wunderbar luck.
Guess who went to beauty school?
The CAMERA WHIP PANS to SGT.DONOWITZ.
Bridget rolls her eyes.

BLACK FRAME

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

CHAPTER FIVE

"REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE"

FADE OFF

INT - SHOSANNAS AND MARCELS LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT
We're in Shosannas and Marcels living quarters, above the
cinema. We've never been in here before.

A SUBTITLE APPEARS ON SCREEN:

NIGHT OF "NATION'S PRIDE" PREMIERE
She's standing before a full length mirror, in a real
attractive Forties style dress for the premiere. She's stunning.
This is the first time in her life she's had the opportunity,
or the occasion to wear something like this. Since she knows
this is the last night of her life, no time like the present.
SOUNDS of the hub-bub of the premiere, not to mention the
German brass band that's blaring Third Reich Marches, can be
heard coming from below.
Shosanna walks to her apartment window, and looks down at the
Germatic miasma below.
SHOSANNAS POV: WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons of
SPECTATORS. Tons of guests dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedos,
and female finery, walking up the long red carpet(with a big
Swastika in the middle, naturally) leading into Shosannas
cinema. The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing away. German Radio
and Film crews covering the event for the fatherland back
home. And of course, MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS providing security
for this joyous Germatic occasion.
Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi, and HOCKS it.
A GERMAN S.S. GENERAL, being interviewed by a RADIO COMMENTATOR,
the lugi HITS him right on his bald head.
Shosanna goes back to the full length mirror, places a very
fashionable Forties style hat on her head, then lowers the
period style black fish net veil over her face. She takes out
a small GUN, and puts it in the pocket of her dress., and it's
on. She exits the apartment door, to join the premiere.
From this point on, there's no turning back, it's all the way
baby, all the fucking way!









12.7.

INT - CINEMA STAIRWELL - NIGHT
The stairwell in the building that connects the living
quarters, with the cinema. She walks down the stairs, goes
through a door that puts her next to the projection booth
door. She takes out a key and opens it.

INT - PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT
Marcels prepping the film reels for tonight. The five silver
metal film cans that carry one 35mm reel of film each are laid
out. The cans for reels one and two are empty. Cans for reel
three, our specially marked can for reel four, and can for
reel five(which should never see the light of a projector)
lie in wait.
Shosanna, looking like a Forties movie star, enters the
projection booth.
The scene in FRENCH SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

MARCEL
Ooh lala, Danielle Darrieux, this
is so exciting. Pleased to meet you.

SHOSANNA
Shut up fool.
Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face, and their lips
meet.

SHOSANNA
Cheeky black bugger. I have to go
down and socialize with these Hun
pigs. Let's go over it again?

MARCEL
Reel one is on the first projector.
Reel two is on the second. Three
and four are ready to go.

SHOSANNA
Okay, the big sniper battle in the
film begins around the middle of
the third reel. Our film, comes on
in the forth reel, so Somewhere
towards the end of the third reel,
go down and lock the doors of the
auditorium. Then take your place
behind the screen, and wait for my
CUE, when I give it to you, BURN IT DOWN!









12 1.

INT - CINEMA LOBBY - NIGHT
The pageantry of the evening is in full swing, as all the
German beautiful people, enter the cinema. They mingle in the
swastika covered, greek nude statue peppered lobby. Nazi
Military Commanders, High Ranking Party Officials, and German
Celebrities(Emil tannings, Veit Harlin), hob knob and drink
Champagne from passing WAITERS who carry glasses on silver
trays.
We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big
staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor
entrance. She descends the staircase, and busies herself with
theatre stuff.
At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race
in all there finery, is Colonel Hans Landa, dressed in his
finest SS Uniform, smoking on his Calabash.

CAMERA FRAME
directly behind him. On the right side, we see the figure of
Col.Landa, from behind, watching the guests entering the
cinema. On the left side of frame, is the cinema entrance,
from a looking down perspective of the guests entering the
building.

THEN...
.A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book, appears on the left
side of frame, obscuring the cinema entrance. Inside of Landas
think bubble, a little scene plays out.

THINK BUBBLE
Inside a hospital room filled with DOCTORS, NURSES, and a
PATIENT in a hospital bed. Then Col.Landa enters the room, and
screams at everybody;

COL.LANDA
I want everybody out of this room!
They start to leave.

COL.LANDA
That means now, goddamnit!
They RUSH OUT.
He walks over to the Patient in the hospital bed, Its none
other then SGT.WILLI, and yes, he's still alive.
Landa pulls up a chair next to the bed, sits down.

COL.LANDA
Can you speak, Sgt?









L - )1.

SGT.WILLI

(WEAKLY)
Yes Colonel.

COL.LANDA
Tell me everything that happened in
there?
The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away, reveling the entrance again,
and as if on perfect cue, in walks Bridget Von Hammersmark,
dressed lovely, leg in a big white cast. The three basterds in
their tuxedos, flank her.

CU COL.LANDA
smiles.
He descends the stairs, towards the four saboteurs...
They speak in GERMAN, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

COL.LANDA
Fraulein Von Hammersmark, what
has befallen Germany's most elegant
swan?

BRIDGET
Colonel Landa, it's been years.
Dashing as ever I see.

COL.LANDA
Flattery will get you everywhere,
fraulein.
They chuckle, and air kiss.

COL.LANDA
So what's happened to your lovely
leg, a by product of kicking ass in
the German cinema, no doubt.

BRIDGET
Save your flattery, you old dog.
I know too many of your former
conquests, to fall into that honey
pot.
Chuckle-chuckle...

COL.LANDA
Seriously, what happened?









130.

BRIDGET
Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I
might add, at mountain climbing.
And this was the result.

COL.LANDA
Mountain climbing? That's how you
injured your leg, mountain climbing?

BRIDGET
Believe it or not, yes it is.
A brief moment passes between the two...

THEN...
The Colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. So uproarious
in fact, that it's quite disconcerting to the four saboteurs.
The Colonel begins to regain his composure...

COL.LANDA
Forgive me, fraulein. I don't mean
laugh at your misfortune. It's just
.mountain climbing? I'm curious
fraulein, what could of ever
compelled you to undertake such a
foolhardy endeavor?
The Double meaning is not lost on the German actress.

BRIDGET
Well, I chant be doing it again,
I can tell you that.

COL.LANDA
That cast looks as fresh as my old
Uncle Gustave, when were you climbing
this mountain, last night?

BRIDGET
Very good eye, Colonel. It happened
yesterday morning.

COL.LANDA
Hummm. And where exactly in Paris
is this mountain?
This stops her for a seconded.
Then Landa laughs it off, taking them off the hook.









13 .

COL.LANDA
I'm just teasing you, fraulein. You
know me, I tease rough. So who are
your three handsome escorts?

BRIDGET
I'm afraid neither three speak a
word of German. Their friends of
mine from Italy. This is a wonderful
Italian stuntman, Antonio Margheriti.
(Meaning Aldo)
A very talented cameraman, Enzo Gorlomi.
(Meaning Donny)
And Enzo's camera assistant, Dominick
Decocco.
The German fraulein turns to the three tuxedo wearing
Basterds.

BRIDGET

(ITALIAN)
Gentlemen, this is a old friend, Col.
Sans Landa of the S.S.
The Basterds know only too well who Landa the Jew Hunter is,
but they can't show it.

LT.ALDO

COL.LANDA
Margheriti...?

(ITALIAN)
Am I saying it correctly...?
.Margheriti?

LT. ALDO

(ITALIAN)
Yes. Correct.

COL.LANDA

(ITALIAN)
Margheriti.... Say it for me once
please...?

LT. ALDO
Margheriti.









13Z       

COL.LANDA

(ITALIAN)
I'm sorry, again...?

LT.ALDO
I4argheriti.

COL.LANDA

(ITALIAN)
Once more... .?

LT.ALDO
Margheriti.

COL.LANDA
Nargheriti.

(FRENCH)
It means daisies, I believe.
Turning his gaze to Donny.

COL.LANDA

(ITALIAN)
What's your name again?

SGT.DONOWITZ
Enzo Gorlomi.

COL.LANDA

(ITALIAN)
Again... .?

SGT.DONOWITZ
Gorlomi.

COL.LANDA

(ITALIAN)
One more time, but let me really
hear the music in it.

SGT.DONOWITZ

(HAMMY ITALIAN)
Gorlomi.
Now to Hirschberg...

COL.LANDA

(ITALIAN)
And you?
Then Hischberg breaks out the best Italian accent of the

GROUP;









)33.

HIRSCHBERG
Dominick Decocco.

COL.LANDA
Dominick Decocco?

HIRSCHBERG
Dominick Decocco.

COL.LANDA
Bravo... . Bravo.

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
Well, my two cameraman friends need
to find there seats.
Col.Landa stops a WAITER with a tray of champagne glasses.

COL.LANDA

(GERMAN)
Not so fast, lets enjoy some champagne.
Everyone gets a glass.

COL.LANDA

(FRENCH)
- Oh, Mademoiselle Mimieux, please
join us, I have some friends I'd
like you to meet.
Shosanna joins the circle, and is handed a champagne glass.
This is the first moment The Basterds are aware of Shosanna.

COL.LANDA

(FRENCH)
May I say Mademoiselle, you look
divine.

SHOSANNA

(FRENCH)
Merci'.

COL.LANDA

(GERMAN)
This lovely young lady, is Mademoiselle
Emmanuelle Mimieux, this is her cinema,
and she is our hostess for the evening.

(FRENCH)
And Mademoiselle, this battered, broken,
and none worse for the wear German
goddess, is Bridget Von Hammersmark.









1 3 W.

BRIDGET
Bonjour.

SHOSANNA
Bon jour.

BRIDGET

(FRENCH)
I'm afraid my companions don't speak
any French, there Italian. This is
Antonino, Enzo, and Dominick.
All three smile goofy spaghetti bender smiles.

COL.LANDA

(FRENCH)
Actually fraulein Von Hammersmarks
Italian associates, need help finding
there seats. Perhaps Mademoiselle
Mimieux would be so kind to escort
them?

SHOSANNA

(FRENCH)
It would be my pleasure. Let me see
your tickets?
Donny hands her two tickets. She indicates for them to follow her.
Donny and Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo,
then follow the young french girl into the auditorium.

INT - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
The cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with grey and black
uniforms.
Shosanna finds the two counterfeit Italians their seats.
After she points out their seats, she turns to leave...
Hirschberg...
.reaches out and grabs her wrist.
He looks her in the face, and filled with tremendous guilt,
because if he's successful tonight he's going to blow this
cute French girl to smithereens, he says;

HIRSCHBERG
Grazie.








13r.
The cute French Girl looks back at the goofy looking Italian
boy with slicked back hair, that makes him look kind of
Jewish, with tremendous guilt, knowing if she is successful
tonight, she's going to burn him alive, and says;

SHOSANNA
Prego.

BACK TO LOBBY
They begin flicking the lights on and off. A GERMAN SOLDIER
YELLS in GERMAN in the lobby;

GERMAN SOLDIER
Take your seats! The show is about to
begin! Everybody take your seatsl
Col.Landa, Lt.Aldo, and Bridget are still together.

COL.LANDA

(GERMAN)
I must call The Fuhrer. He doesn't
want to make his entrance untill
everybody seated. Come with me Frau
Von Hammersmark. The Fuhrer has
heard your here, and he wishes to
commend you personally.

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
Me? Why?

COL.LANDA

(GERMAN)
Don't be modest. Everybody is quite
taken with your resolve. A accident,
like you've just experienced, and
yet you still show up to to a
important Party event. The Fuhrer
was quite adamant in his gratitude.
We'll use Mademoiselle Mimieux's office.
(To Aldo
in Italian)
I'm afraid I must rob you of your
companion, but only for a moment.

BRIDGET

(ITALIAN)
Yes, apparently The Fuhrer wishes
to commend me.









' 36

COL.LANDA

(ITALIAN)
Wait here a moment. I promise I won't
detain her long.
What are ether of them suppose to do, argue?
Col.Landa goes over to one of the Nazi GAURD USHER, and
whispers in his ear, gesturing toward Aldo. Like he's saying,
leave the boy alone, till we come back... .Or is he?
Col.Landa limps Bridget away towards Shosannas office.
As Aldo stands in the lobby, more and more people enter the
auditorium, till it's only Aldo and the six Nazi Gaurd Ushers
in the now vacant lobby.

INT - SHOSANNA'S OFFICE - NIGHT
Shosanna's cinema manager office. It's small, cluttered, and
dominated by a desk.
They both enter.
Col.Landa closes the door behind him, and LOCKS IT.
Bridget notices, but says nothing.
Now the two Germans are alone.

COL.LANDA
Have a seat fraulein.
Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk.
She lowers herself in the chair.
Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk,
opposite her. The SS Colonel pulls another little chair over,
and places it in front of the fraulein.
He sits. Their knees almost touching.
The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.

COL.LANDA

(GERMAN)
Let me see your foot.

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
I beg your pardon?









1 31
Patting his lap.

COL.LANDA
Put your foot in my lap.

BRIDGET
Colonel, you embarrass me.

COL.LANDA
I assure you fraulein, my intention
is not to flirt.
Patting his lap more with more aggression.
The nervous fraulein, lifts up her strapy dress shoe enclosed
foot, and places it in the Colonel's lap.
The Colonel, very delicately, unfastens the thin straps that
hold the frauleins shoe on her foot...
.He removes the shoe...
.Leaving only the frauleins bare foot...

THEN...
He removes from his heavy SS coat pocket, the pretty dress shoe
the fraulein left behind at La Louisiane...
He slips it on her foot...
.it fits like a glove.
Bridget knows she's BUSTED.
Col.Landa smiles and says in ENGLISH;

COL.LANDA
What's that American expression...
"if the shoe fits...you must wear it".
He removes her foot from his lap.

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
What now Colonel?

COL LANDA

(GERMAN)
Do you admit you treachery?
She stares defiant daggers into him.









1314

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
The only thing I will admit to, is
resisting you...

(ENGLISH)
Sons-a-bitches..

(GERMAN)
.to my last breath.

COL.LANDA

(GERMAN)
"Resist to your last breath"?

SUDDENLY...
Hans LUNGES forward, putting his strong mitts around Bridget
Von Hammersmarks lily white delicate neck, and with all the
violence of a Lion in mid-pounce, SQUEEZES with all his MIGHT.
Bridgets face turns tomato RED, as the VEINS in her face
BULGE, and her esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP.
With a violent YANK, he JERKS her TO THE FLOOR. She TUMBLES
out of the chair, Landa never releasing his GRIP around her
throat. Nov fully on top of her, he BEARS DOWN, SQUEEZING THE
VERY LIFE OUT OF HER. Every thing he has, he brings to bear on
the elegant ladies neck.
Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING THE BACK OF

HER HEAD, HARD AGAINST THE FLOOR...

BANG!

BANG!

BANG?
She's dead.
He releases the grip around her throat. His hands are

TREMBLING...
He rises.
Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bear hands,
is the most violent act a human being can commit.
Also, only humans strangle, the opposable thumbs being quite
important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the
sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task,
still surges through him. He tries to gain control of the
trembling, that is rippling through his body. He takes out a
silver SS FLASK(filled with peach schnapps), and knocks back
a couple of swigs. He holds his hand out in front of him. The
TREMBLING is beginning to subside. He picks up the telephone.









139-
Into the phone in German he says;

COL.LANDA
Inform The Fuhrer the audience has
taken there seats, and we're ready
to begin.
Step one, in Hans master plan, done.
He then dials another number...

INT - LOBBY - NIGHT
Aldo in the lobby...

WHEN...
.he's JUMPED by the SIX NAZI USHERS...
He's THROWN ROUGHLY to the ground face first. Like the modern
day Secret Service, within seconds, his wrists are handcuffed
behind his back, he's searched, they find the BOMB attached to
his ankle, it's removed, a BLACK CLOTH BAG is pulled over his
head, then he's hoisted up, and RUSHED out of the building.
This happens in mere seconds, and quietly too, no one in the
auditorium is none the wiser...

INT - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
,including Donowitz and Hirschberg, sitting amongst the
master race, waiting for showtime.

EXT - CINEMA - NIGHT
The Six Nazi Soldiers, hustle the hooded Aldo, down the red
carpet, then into the alley besides the cinema.
Aldo's put up against a wall.
Inside the black hood, he's SCREAMING every insulting thing
about Germany, Germans, German food, German
shepherd... anything.

COL.LANDA'S VOICE(OS)
Shut up!
The faceless black hood does.
Col.Landa, now standing directly in front of his hooded
prisoner, says in ENGLISH;

COL.LANDA
As Stanley said to Livingston;
Lt.Aldo Raine, I presume?








I 'to.

LT. ALDO
Hans Landa?

COL.LANDA
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
Alas, your now in the hands of the
SS. My hands to be exact. And they've
been waiting along time, to touch you.
He reaches out with his finger, and lightly touches Aldo's
face right in the middle of the hood.
Aldo's head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES.

COL.LANDA
Caught ya flinching.
In German, he orders the men put Aldo in the back of a truck.
Aldo, bound, and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the
truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeurs uniform,
bound, and bagged like the Lieutenant.
The Truck drives off.
Col.Landa turns around, and SEES FROM A DISTANCE, Hitlers
motorcade pull up to the cinema.. Then the Fuhrer, Goebbels,
Francesca, and the rest of the entourage, make there way down
the red carpet into the cinema.
Landa smiles.

EXT TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT
We see the truck leaving the city of Paris, under the veil of
night.
We also seem to be leaving the drama of Operation Kino.

INT - TRUCK(MOVING) - NIGHT
The two hooded prisoners, bounce along in the back of the
truck.
Utivich, is crying inside his hood.

LT.ALDO
Utivich?

UTIVICH
Is that you Lieutenant?

LT. ALDO
Yep.








lyl.

UTIVIC I
Do you know what happened to Donny?
Hirchberg? The woman?

LT.ALDO
No I do not.

UTIVICH
Lieutenant, sorry I'm crying.

LT. ALDO
Nothin to be sorry about, son.
This bag, get to anyone.

UTIVICH
Not exactly John Wayne, am I?

LT.ALDO
John Waynes a pampered movie star.
He burst into tears, if his cook,
busts his yoke at breakfast. Just
try puttin a bag over his head, and
hear what kinda sounds he makes.
Utivich, giggles through the tears.

LT.ALDO
I just want you to know, son, I was
real proud of you tonight. Learnin
how to drive overnight. Driving in
that Limo line. You was in the hot
seat, son, and you stood up real good.
Utivich Cries LOUDER.
Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivichs foot, and places his foot
on top.
The TOUCH has a slight calming effect on Utivich.
In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity.

EXT- COUNTRY TAVERN - NIGHT
The truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of Paris(not La
Louisaiane),
The two hooded prisoners, are walked inside the establishment.

INT - COUNTRY TAVERN - NIGHT
The hooded men are lead into the closed for business, but open
for something else, rustic tavern.








0The Nazi Guards, unlock the handcuff, then sit them down inchairs.
Then, simultaneously, the hoods are YANKED OFF.
The two prisoners, are seated at a table, in what they can now
see, is a rustic tavern. On the table is one telephone, one
bottle of Chianti, and three glasses. And on the opposite end
of the table, sits Colonel Hans Landa.
A NAZI SOLDIER sits posted at  a impressive looking two way
radio set up in the tavern.
Colonel Lands starts in right away at the two baffled,
discombobulated American soldiers.
They will only speak ENGLISH in the scene.

COL.LANDA
Italian? Really?

(BEAT)
What could you have possibly been
thinking?

LT. ALDO
Well, I speak alittle Italian -

COL.LANDA
I speak a little Tagalog, but I
wouldn't begin to presume I could
pass for Filipino. Don't get me
wrong, I understand you were in a
pickle, what with you losing your
Germans. And I have nothing but
admiration for improvisation.
Still.... Chico Marx is more
convincing. if the three of you had
shown up to the premiere dressed
in womans attire, it would have been
more convincing.
Landas eyes go to the Two Nazi Guards behind the prisoners.

COL.LANDA

(GERMAN)
You may leave us. But stay alert
outside.
They exit, leaving the Colonel, the Lieutenant, the
Private and a German Radio Man in the corner.









"43'

COL.LANDA
So your Aldo the Apache?

LT. ALDO
So your The Jew Hunter?

COL.LANDA
Jew Hunter, (pfuit), I'm a detective.
A damn good detective. Finding
people is my specialty. So naturally,
I worked for the Nazi's finding people.
And yes, some of them were Jews.
But Jew Hunter? Just the name that stuck.

UTIVICH
Well you do hafts admit, it is
catchy.

COL.LANDA
Do you control the nicknames, your
enemies bestow on you? Aldo the
Apache and The Little Man?

UTIVICH
What do you mean, The Little Man?

COL.LANDA
The Germans nickname for you.

UTIVICH
The Germans nickname for me is, The
Little Man?

COL.LANDA
Or "The Little One, ether one means you.
And as if to make my point, I'm
a little surprised how tall you
were in real life. I mean, your a
little fellow. But not circus midget
little, as your reputation would
suggest.

LT.ALDO
Where is my men? Where is Bridget
Von Hammersmark?

COL.LANDA
Bridget Von Hammersmark. Oh I'm sure
she's in whatever, big bubbling
cesspool in hell, the devil reserves
for traitors of her ilk.









COL. LANDA

(COR'T)
Well, lets just say, she got what
she deserved. And when you purchase
friends like Bridget Von Hammersmark,
you get what you pay for.
Now as far as your Pisanos,
Sgt.Donowitz, and Pt.Hirschberg-

LT. ALDO
How do you know our names?

COL.LANDA
Lt.Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't
interrogate every single one of your
swastika marked survivors... .?
We simply aren't operating on the
level of mutual respect I assumed.
Now, back to the whereabouts of your
two Italian saboteurs. At this
moment, both Hirschberg, and
Donowitz, should be sitting in the
very seats we left them in. Seats,
0023 and 0024, if my memory serves.
Explosives, still around
there ankle, still ready to
explode. And your mission, some
would call a terrorist plot, as of
this moment, is still a go.
The two Basterds don't believe this. It can't be true.

LT. ALDO
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next, Eliza on the ice?

COL.LANDA
However, all I have to do, is pick
pick up that phone right there.
Inform the cinema, and your plans
kupet.

LT. ALDO
IF, their still there, and IF their
still alive, and that's one big IF,
there ain't no way, you gonna take
them boys without settin off them
bombs.









I R.T.

COL.LANDA

M
I have no doubt, and yes, some
Germans will die., and yes, it will
ruin the evening, and yes, Goebbels
will be very very very mad at you
for what you've done to his big night.
But you won't get Hitler, you won't
get Goebbels, you won't get Gering,
and you won't get Boorman. And you
need all four to end the war.

(PAUSE)
But if I don't pick up that phone,
right there, you may very well get
all four. And if you get all four,
you end the war...tonight.
The Nazi Colonel lifts up the bottle of Chianti, and fills
three glasses. As he pours, he says;

COL.LANDA
So gentlemen, lets discuss the
prospect of ending the war-tonight.
All three have their Chianti filled glasses.

COL.LANDA
So the way I see it, since Hitlers
death, or possible rescue, rests
solely on my reaction...If I do
nothing ...it's as if I'm causing his
death, even more then yourselves.
Would you agree?

LT. ALDO
I guess so.

COL.LANDA
How about you Uitivich?

UITIVICH
I guess so too.

COL.LANDA
Good, we more or less, all agree.
Gentlemen, I have no intention, of
Killing Hitler, and killing Goebbels,
and Killing Gerring, and killing
Boorman, not to mention winning the
war single handedly for the allies,
only later, to find myself standing
before a Jewish tribunal.








I q
Now they get it.

COL.LANDA
If you want to win the war, tonight,
We have to make a deal.

LT.ALDO
What kinda deal?

COL.LANDA
The kind you wouldn't have the
authority to make. However, I'm sure
this mission of yours, has a
commanding officer? A General, I'm
betting. For ..

(THINKING)
.O.S.S. would be my guess.
Aldo's eyebrows reveal that was a good guess.

COL.LANDA
Oooh, that's a bingo. Is that the
way you say it, That's a bingo?

LT.ALDO
You just say, bingo.

COL.LANDA
Bingo! How fun. But I digress, where
were we? Oh yes, make a deal. Over
there is a very capable two way
radio. And sitting behind it, is a
more then capable radio operator,
named Herrman. Get me somebody on
the other end of that radio with the
power of the pen, to authorize my
- Let's call it, the terms of my
conditional surrender, if that taste
better going down.

BACK TO THE PREMIERE
Shosanna in the booth, she brings down the lights.
In the packed, excited auditorium, the house lights go down.
CU CURTAIN SWITCH, she flips it.
In the auditorium, the RED VELVET CURTAINS part.
Shosanna, throws the lever on the first projector.

The PROJECTOR BULB goes HOT WHITE, PROJECTING A BEAM...

Shosanna, in the booth, watches through the little window...
The CAMERA PANS OFF of Shosanna, to the clearly marked film
can, REEL FOUR. The SURPRISE REEL.

BACK TO LANDA AND THE HASTERDS
Landa, with radio headphones over his ears, and a microphone
in his hand, talks to the UNSEEN UNHEARD American Brass on the
other end.

COL.LANDA
.So, when the military history of
this night is written, it will be
recorded, that I was part of
"Operation Rino" from the very
beginning, as a double agent.
Anything I've done in my guise as a
SS Colonel, was sanctioned by The
O.S.S., as a necessary evil to
establish my cover with The Germans.
And it was my placement, of
Lt.Raines dynamite in Hitler and
Goebbels opera box that assured
there demise. By the way, that last
part is actually true.

FLASH ON
Landa placing bomb in Goebbels and Francesca's opera box.

BACK TO LANDA

COL.LANDA
I want my full military pension and
benefits under my proper rank.
I want to receive the congregational
medal of honor, for my invaluable
assistance in the toppling of the Third
Reich.








He looks over and sees Aldo and Uitvich watching the one sided
conversation.

COL.LANDA
In fact, I want all the members of
"Operation Kino" to receive the
congregational medal of honor. Full
citizenship for myself - but that
goes without saying. And I would
like the United States of America to
purchase property for me on
Nantuckett island, as a reward for
all the countless lives I've saved
by bringing the tyranny of the
National Socialist party to a
swifter then imanged end. Do you
have all that, sir?

(PAUSE)
I look forward to seeing you face to
face as well, sir.

(PAUSE)
He's right here.
The Colonel hands the headphones and microphone to Aldo.

LT.ALDO
Yes, sir?
We HEAR the VOICE on the other end of the radio, give Aldo his

ORDERS;

RADIO VOICE(OS)
Colonel Landa will put you and
Private Uitivich in a truck as
prisoners. Then he and his radio
operator, will get in the truck,
drive to our lines. Upon crossing
our lines, Colonel Landa and his
man will surrender to you. You will
then take over driving of the truck,
a bring them straight to me for
debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant?

LT.ALDO
Yes, sir.
The Conversation is over, he puts the radio down.
The three men look at one another.
Landa picks up his wine.








Ito .

COL.LANDA
So I suppose the only thing left to
do is lift a glass, and toast to
Donowitz and Hirschbergs success.
You too Herrman, come over here.
The four men, Col.Hans Landa, Lt.Aldo Raine, Pvt.Smithson
Uitivich, and Herrman, lift up four glasses of wine.

COL.LANDA
Gentlemen, To history, and it's
Witnesses.

CHEERS.

BACK TO THE PREMIERE

WE CUT TO THE B W FILM ON SCREEN.
Fredrick Zoller, playing himself, is in a ornamental tower in
a Russian village, picking off RUSSIAN SOLDIER's below.

A RUSSIAN GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY
peering at the German Private through binoculars. He lowers
the long range glasses, and confers with one of his OFFICERS.

GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY

(RUSSIAN)
What's the death toll?

OFFICER

(RUSSIAN)
47, so far.

WE HEAR A SHOT.

OFFICER

(RUSSIAN)
48. General, I implore you, we must
destroy that tower!

GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY

(RUSSIAN)
That tower is one of the oldest, and
most beautiful structures in Russia.
I won't be responsible for turning a
thousand years of history into dust!
A BRAVE RUSSIAN SOLDIER, tries to run between two buildings.
Zoller, gets him.
Then proceeds to pick him apart, one single bullet at a time.

SHOSANNA IN PROJECTION BOOTH
She removes "REEL 4" (The Special Shosanna Reel), and prepares
it on the 2nd Projector. Reel3, on the first Projector,
playing now, is halfway through. In a few short minutes, it's
going to be show time.
Marcel says to Shosanna in FRENCH, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

MARCEL
It's time. I should go lock the auditorium,
and take my place behind the screen.
This is the last time they will ever see each other, too much
to say. He holds her in his arms and lays a one kiss before I
die wet one on her.

DONOWITZ AND HIRSCHBERG
sit in their seats watching the movie, surrounded by DRESS
UNIFORM NAZI'S. They've developed a dopey way of communicating
with each other in this hostel environment.
Basically, speaking English like it were gibberish Italian.
They say English words, only adding a "I", or a "A", or a "O",
to the end of it. And saying it in a exaggerated Italian
accent, complete with pantomimes.
Donowitz leans into Hirschberg, and says in a wispier;
They speak in ITALIA-ISH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

SGT.DONOWITZ

(ITALIA-ISH)
I-a Go-a Toilet-a, Set-ta Boom-a.
(I go to the toilet and set the bomb)
When-a I-a Go-a, you-a Set-ta Boom-a.
(When I go, you set your bomb)
Hirschberg indicates pantomimes, he can't set his bomb
surrounded by all these Nazi's.
Donowitz, pantomimes crossing his legs, setting bomb on ankle
in his seat. Then getting up, and dropping it in the back of
the auditorium, in the dark.
Hirschberg doesn't get it.

HIRSCHBERG
What-a?
(What?)
Donny pantomimes again, more exaggerated, and with less
patience.









HIRSCHBERG
Affirm-ato, affirm-ato.
(Affirmative, affirmative)

SGT.DONOWITZ
They-o Look-o Screen-a, Not-o You-a.
(They're looking at the screen, not you.)

HIRSCHBERG
Fantastic-o.

(FANTASTIC)

SGT.DONOWITZ
After-teri, Set-ta, Five-o Moment-o
(Pointing to

WATCH)
You-a, Pphisst.
(After you set the bomb, wait five
minutes, and get out of here)

HIRSCHBERG

(What?)

SGT.DONOWITZ
Confuse-i, confuss-i, confuss-i.
(Confused, confused, confused.)
What-a, and-o what-o, same-o?
(I thought "What-a" meat "What",
does "What-O" mean "What", as well?)

HIRSCHBERG
Oh-o, sorr-o, I-o ment-a "What-a".
(Oh, sorry, I ment what.)

SGT.DONOWITZ
After-teri, you-a set-ta boom-a,

HIRSCHBERG
Affirm-ato, affirm-ato.
(Affirmative, Affirmative)

SGT.DONOWITZ
Good-a, Luck-a.
(Good luck.)









15Z.
Donowitz stands from his seat, and walks out of the dark
auditorium, into the lobby. The Nazi Guards Ushers are gone,
the lobby is completely empty. Seeing the STAIRS leading down
to the WATER CLOSET BATHROOM, he descends them to plant
the Boom-a, I mean, The Bomb.

DESCENDING THE STAIRS
leading to the Water closet. Like a lot of old cinema's, not
only was the water closet located under the auditorium, you
had to pass through a rather large SMOKING LOUNGE to get to
it. In the Smoking Lounge are TEN NAZI ENLISTED MEN, the
Guards Ushers for the event, smoking and indulging in soldiers
gossip. They're all in dress uniforms, and all are armed.
Donowitz, in his tuxedo, acts cool, and walks right through
them.
They look up, but don't disturb there time off vibe.
Donny enters the big Water Closet. Except for ONE LONE NAZI
ENLISTED MAN at the urinal, it would appear as if
Donny has the whole wash room to himself.
He enters the privacy of a toilet stall, locks the door.

MARCEL IN LOBBY
He descends the stairs leading down from the projection booth,
into the empty lobby. He goes to one of the auditorium doors,
and peers inside.

WE SEE THE SCREEN AND THE AUDIENCE FROM MARCELS POV:
in the back of the room. The audience seems riveted to
Fredrick's exploits on screen.
Marcel closes the door, and with a KEY, DEADBOLTS it SHUT.

INSIDE THE AUDITORIUM
WE PAN OFF THE SCREEN to Marcel, who locks the two doors on
ether side of the screen....due to curtains placed there, no
one notices Marcels actions.
Marcel then goes BEHIND THE SCREEN, WE SEE the IMAGE
(backward) of Fredricks sniper battle HUGE COVERING ENTIRE
SIDE ROOM ...A PILE of over300nitrate FILM PRINTS, lay like a
junk pile, right behind the screen.
Sitting down in a wooden chair facing the screen, and
Pile-o-film, he lights up a cigarette, a absolute no-no in a
cinema of this era, but tonight, what does it matter?4.
He smokes, and waits for his cue to... .BURN IT DOWN!









)53.

FREDRICK IN OPERA BOX
along side Hitler, Goebbels, Francesca, and BOORMAN. On screen
the battle rages. He leans over and whispers something in
Goebbels ear, we can't hear. Goebbels makes a very sympathetic
face (at least sympathetic for Goebbels), and says in German;

GOEBBELS
Perfectly understandable, dear boy.
You go now, and we'll see you after
the show.
He exits the opera box. And walks to the projection booth
door. He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way.
The door opens, just a little bit, Shosanna not friendly,
stares at him.
Be, as per usual, is all smiles and charm.
They speak in FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

FREDRICK
Are you the manager, of this cinema?
I want my money back. That actor in
the movie stinks.
He laughs.

IV
She doesn't even smile. She says, in all serious business;

SHOSANNA
What are you doing here?

FREDRICK
I came to visit you.

SHOSANNA
Can't you see how busy I am?

FREDRICK
Then allow me to lend a assist.

SHOSANNA
Fredrick it's not funny, you can't
be here. This is your premiere, you
need to be out there with them.
As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale, with all the
charm at his command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel
is just about over, and her big reel change is coming up.









FREDRICK
Normally, you would be.right.
And for all the other films I do,
I intend to endure evenings like
tonight, in the proper sprit.
However the fact remains, this film,
is based on my military exploits.
And in this case, my exploits
consisted of me killing many men.
Consequently, the part of the film
that's playing now,... .I don't like
watching this part.

SHOSANNA
Fredrick, I am sorry, but -

FREDRICK
- So, I thought, I'd come up here
and do what I do best, annoy you.
And from the look on your face, it
would appear I haven't lost my touch.

DONNY IN TOILET
Sgt.Donowitz, with BOMB in his lap, sets the timer, six
minutes from now. He then places the bomb in the back of the
toilet tank.

CAMERA ON FLOOR OF WATER CLOSET
we see the tile of the floor stretch out before us. We see
Donny's feet in the closed toilet stall. We HEAR, the OFF
SCREEN Nazi Enlisted Man, finish his piss. Then HIS SHOES WALK
THROUGH FRAME... .WE FOLLOW THEM TO... .The SINK...WE STAY ON
The Shoes ...as WE HEAR The Soldier WASH HIS HANDS... THEN...
THE CAMERA RISES UP HIS PANT LEG...Till...WE"RE EYE LEVEL with
the German Soldier, with a ARMY CAP on his head, who's
done washing his hands....THEN....The Soldier removes
his cap, brushes some bangs out of his face, and WE CAN SEE

THE SWASTIKA HAND CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD, UNDENIABLE MARK
OF THE BASTARDS. He SPLASHES some WATER ON HIS FACE, puts his
cap back on his head, and joins his comrades in the smoking
lounge. As he exits FRAME, he says to somebody OFF SCREEN;

SWASTIKA FOREHEAD

(GERMAN)
Hey Fritz, you owe me three cigarettes,
now pay up.

SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK
Fredrick still outside the doorway, and Shosanna, still baring
the way.

SHOSANNA
I have to get prepared for the reel
change.









FREDRICK
Let me do it?

SHOSANNA
No.

FREDRICK
Oh please, it's been two years since
i've done a reel change.

SHOSANNA
I said, no.

FREDRICK
(Cute whine)
Come on, it's my premiere.

SHOSANNA
Are you so use to the Nazi's kissing
your ass, you've forgotten what the
word,        No" means? No Fredrick, you
can't come in here, now go away!
No subtitles for Fredrick needed this time, he gets it.
He does a one-armed PILE DRIVE PUSH on the door, knocking both
it OPEN, and Shosanna back into the room.
Fredrick, a different cat then we've seen up till now, enters
the booth, closing the door behind him, and LOCKING it.
The quite startled Shosanna, says to Fredrick;

SHOSANNA
Fredrick, you hurt me.

FREDRICK
Well, it's nice to know you can feel
something. Even if it's just physical
pain.
Fredrick steps forward...
Shosanna steps backwards...

FREDRICK
I'm not a man you say, "Go away"
to. There's over three hundred
dead bodies in Russia, that if
they could, would testify to that.
After what I've done for you, you
disrespect me at your peril.









156.

BACK TO WASHROOM
The Swastika Forehead Soldier, get a light for his cigarette.
He takes a big drag.

SOLDIER'S POV:
He faces the washroom, and down that long throw, he sees Donny
emerge from the toilet stall. His tuxedo jacket is off, and
draped over his right hand. Sporting the white dress shirt,
and black tuxedo vest. He's quite far away, so now he just
looks like some guy in a tux, who just finished taking a shit.
Donny walks toward us ...

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
seeing him get closer...

SOLDIER POV:
Donny gets closer...

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
seeing him closer still...

SOLDIER POV:
Donny gets closer...

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
begins to notice...

SOLDIER POV:
Donny getting closer, begins to notice, German soldier notice
him...

CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
now Donny is close enough for the Soldier to recognize. His
face SCREAMS;

SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
The Bear Jew!1!
The Soldier's GUN is out of it's holster, and rising toward
Donny's chest...

WHEN...
Donny raises his right arm, with the tuxedo jacket on it, and
FIRES a GUN concealed under it.
HITTING Swastika Forehead in the chest...Who finishes raising
his GUN, FIRING HITTING Donny in the chest...
The Two Soldier's FIRE INTO each other.... Till there weapons are
empty, and the two men lie dead on the floor.
The Nine other NAZI'S in the room, stand shocked at what just
happened in front of them.

SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK IN PROJECTION BOOTH
Fredrick hears the gunshots below them, and turns towards the
door.

FREDRICK
What the hell was that?
While Fredrick's back is turned, Shosanna takes a GUN out of
her pocket, and SHOOTS Fredrick THREE TIMES in the back...
..Be CRASHES HARD into the door, then FALLING FACE FIRST to
the floor...
Shosanna, gun in hand, looks out projection booth window into
the audience...
The ON SCREEN BATTLE rages so LOUDLY with GUNFIRE, that her
weapon didn't stand a chance of being heard.
Her eyes go from the audience...
.up to the big screen...
.Which holds FREDRICK ZOLLER in a tight handsome CLOSE UP.
The Face on the silver screen, breaks the young girl's
heart...
.She looks to his body, lying face down on the floor, blood
flowing from the holes she put in his back...
.His body moves a little, and he lets out a painful MOAN...
.DIEING though he is, at this moment, Fredrick is still

ALIVE...
Shosanna moves to him...
..She touches him, and he lets out another MOAN...
.She turns his body over on it's back...
..he's holding a LUGER in his hand...
.he FIRES TWICE...

BANG BANG
Two bullets HIT HER POINT BLANK IN THE CHEST...
THROWING HER against the wall, then FALLING FORWARD on her
knees to the floor...
..Fredrick, Luger still in hand, takes aim from the floor...









I,

.FIRES...
HITTING the bloody girl on the floor, in the thigh...
.SPINNING her BODY around in agony...
Like he did to the Russian on screen, he picks her apart, one
bullet at a time...

.FIRES...

BULLET BLOWS OFF HEEL OF HER FOOT...
Luger drops to floor, Fredrick DIES.
Our young French Jewish heroine, lies on the projection booth
floor, in a pool of her own blood, her body RIDDLED with
bullets, her nerve endings wracked with pain, CRIPPLED and

DIEING...

WHEN...
..the little bell on the 1st projector, starts to ring,
informing the projectionist, it's time for The REEL CHANGE.
Dieing or not, if Shosanna intends to get her revenge, she's
going to have to lift her ass off the floor, and execute this
fucking reel change.

CINEMA AUDITORIUM
The battle on screen continues waging. The audience is
riveted.
The FUHRER
watches, completely caught up in the dramatic spectacle.
He says to Goebbels in German;

HITLER
Extraordinary Joseph, simply
extraordinary. This is your finest
film yet.
Goebbels is beyond proud, he smiles to Francesca, who proudly
pats his hand.

PROJECTION BOOTH
Shosanna, bloody, crippled, and fucked, with great painful
effort, PULLS HERSELF OFF THE FLOOR...

Hirschberg, sitting in his seat, SETS the BOMB on his ankle.
Then stands up, and begins scooting past everybody in his rows
knees.

like the German heroine in one of Riefenstahl's mountain films,
Shosanna CLIMBS UP the 35mm film projector, like it was

right corner of The FRAME. WE SEE the 1st REEL CHANGE MARK...

ON SILVER SCREEN MATCHING SHOSANNA EX CU
CAMERA in the exact same placement, same background (b w sky),
SLIGHT LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP, so on screen Shosanna is looking
down on the Nazi's, the way Fredrick was looking down on the
Russians. The way this HUGE IMAGE OF SHOSANNA'S GIANT FACE stares
down the auditorium of Nazi's, brings to mind Orwells "1984"
Big Brother.
HITLER and GOEBBELS
React.

HIRSCHBERG
standing in the middle of the aisle, turns towards the screen.
When he see's Shosanna's GIANT FACE, he's gobsmacked.

BEHIND SCREEN
Marcel sitting in the chair, with his cigarette, before the

EVEN MORE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA.

SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE ON SCREEN
She stares down the packed house of Nazi's, and says
in FRENCH;

SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE
I have a message for Germany. I'm
interrupting your Nazi propaganda
horse shit, to inform you despicable
German swine, that your all going to
die.
HITLER and GOEBBELS

AUDITORIUM AUDIENCE
While the shocked German audience is transfixed to thescreen,
behind the heads of most of them...
The BOMB Landa set in Hitlers and Goebbels opera box...

EXPLODES.








BLOWING TO SMITHEREENS, HITLER, FRANCESCA, BOORMAN, and
propelling GOEBBELS, still in his theatre seat, across the
auditorium, into the opposite wall, and taking out a portion
of the ceiling as well.
The crowd reacts...
The explosion causes the huge chandelier from Versailles, to
topple from it's jerry-rigged placement, and CRASH on to the
audience below...
ON SCREEN THE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA finishes her WAR CRY.

SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is
the face of Jewish Vengeance! Marcel,

BURN IT DOWN!

BEHIND THE SCREEN
Marcel takes his cigarette, and FLICKS IT into the pile of
nitrate film.
ON SCREEN SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE LAUGHS MANIACALLY at the
scrambling little Nazi's, running in a panic, as FLAMES LIKE

OUT OF A GIANT BLAST FURNACE, BURST THROUGH SHOSANNAS FACE,
and CLIMB UP THE WALLS of the cinema.
The AUDIENCE
STAMPEDES towards the exits...

HIRSCHBERG
with bomb set on ankle, is caught in a massive Day of the
Locust SWARM OF BODIES...
People frantically pound on locked doors, trapping them to
there grizzly fate.
The FLAMES and FIRE spread through thr auditorium...
Hirschberg caught in people crunch, knows this is it.

HIS ANKLE BOMB GOES OFF
right underneath everybody in the room.
The effect this has on the people in the room, is very similar
to that of the effect a M-80blowing up in a ant hill, would
have on the ants. The auditorium is a literal red rain of legs,
arms, heads, torsos, and asses.

THEN...

DONOWITZ TOILET BOMB
BLOWS UP UNDERNEATH the auditorium.

CUT TO

EXT -- WOODS - MORNING
It's a misty early morning, in the woodsy area. The German
truck, with Aldo and Uitvich in the back, and Landa and
Herrman in the front comes to stop.
LANDA and HERRMAN IN TRUCK CAB
Herrman, behind the wheel, tells Landa in German;

HERRMAN
These are the American lines, sir.
In the back of the truck, sit the two last remaining members
of The Basterds, Lt.Aldo Raine, and Prvt.Smithson Uitivich,
both with their hands cuffed behind there back.
Landa and Herrman appear at truck rear, says in ENGLISH;

COL.LANDA
Okay Gentlemen, you can climb down.



143
Aldo and Uitivich climb down from the truck.
Col.Landa indicates for Herrman to remove the handcuffs from
the two prisoners.
He does.

COL.LANDA
Herrman, hand them your weapon.
He does.
Col.Landa hands over his LUGER, and his very cool looking SS

DAGGER.

COL.LANDA
I am officially surrendering myself
over to you, Lt.Raine. We are your
prisoners.

LT.ALDO
Thank you very much Colonel. Uitivich,
cuff the Colonel's hands behind his
back.

COL.LANDA
Is that really necessary?
As Uitivich cuffs the. Colonels hands behind his back, Aldo

SAYS;

LT.ALDO
I'm a slave to appearances.
Then Aldo takes the Luger, and SHOOTS HERRMAN DEAD.
The bound Col.Landa is appalled.

COL.LANDA
Are you mad? What have you done? I made
a deal with your General for that mans
life!

LT. ALDO
Yeah, they made that deal, but they
don't give a fuck about him, they
need you.

COL.LANDA
You'll be shot for this.








t 6 q.

LT.ALDO
Raw I don't think so, more like I'll
be chewed out. I've been chewed out
before. You know, Uitvich and myself,
heard that deal you made with the Brass.
End the war tonight? I'd make that deal.
How bout you Uitivich, you make that
deal?

UITIVICH
I'd make that deal.

LT.ALDO
I don't blame ya. Damn good deal.
And that pretty little nest ya
feathered for yourself. Well, if
your willing to barbecue the whole
high command, I suppose that's worth
certain considerations. Now I don't
care about you gettin pensions,
merit badges, ticker tape parades,
who gives a damn, let's all go home.
But .1do have one question?
When you go to your little place on
Nantuckett Island, I image you gonna
take off that handsome looking SS
uniform of yours, ain't ya?
For the first time in the movie, Col.Landa doesn't-respond.

LT.ALDO
That's what I thought. Now that...
.I can't abide. How bout you
Uitivich, can you abide it?

UITIVICH
Not one damn bit, sir.

LT.ALDO
I mean if I had my way, you'd wear
that goddamn uniform for the rest of
your pecker suckin life. But I'm
aware that's ain't practical. I mean
at some point ya gotta hafta take it
off.
He opens LandaSS DAGGER, and holds the BLADE in front of Hans
face.

LT.ALDO
So I'm gonna give you a little
somethin you can't take off.

CUT TO


16c.

CU COL.LANDA
The Dagger has just completed carving a swastika deep into his
forehead.

COL.LANDA'S POV:
On the ground, looking up at Aldo, bloody knife in hand, who
straddles him.. And Uitivich, who's next to him. The two
Basterds admire Aldo's handiwork.

LT.ALDO
You know somethin Uitivich, I think
this just might be my masterpiece.

FADE IN ON:

COMPUTER SCREEN

So close it has no boundaries.

A blinking cursor pulses in the electric darkness like a
heart coursing with phosphorous light, burning beneath
the derma of black-neon glass.

A PHONE begins to RING, we hear it as though we were
making the call.  The cursor continues to throb,
relentlessly patient, until --

MAN (V.O.)
Hello?

Data now slashes across the screen, information flashing
faster than we read.

SCREEN
Call trans opt:  received.
2-19-96  13:24:18  REC:Log 

WOMAN (V.O.)
I'm inside.  Anything to report?

We listen to the phone conversation as though we were on
a third line.  The man's name is CYPHER.  The woman,
TRINITY.

CYPHER (V.O.)
Let's see.  Target left work at
5:01 PM.

SCREEN
Trace program:  running.

The entire screen fills with racing columns of numbers.
Shimmering like green-electric rivets, they rush at a 10-
digit phone number in the top corner.

CYPHER (V.O.)
He caught the northbound Howard
line. Got off at Sheridan.
Stopped at 7-11.  Purchased six-
pack of beer and a box of Captain
Crunch.  Returned home.

The area code is identified.  The first three numbers
suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.

We begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each
digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like
the wheels of a slot machine.

TRINITY (V.O.)
All right, you're relieved.  Use
the usual exit.

CYPHER (V.O.)
Do you know when we're going to
make contact?

TRINITY
Soon.

Only two thin digits left.

CYPHER (V.O.)
Just between you and me, you don't
believe it, do you?  You don't
believe this guy is the one?

TRINITY (V.O.)
I think Morpheus believes he is.

CYPHER (V.O.)
I know.  But what about you?

TRINITY (V.O.)
I think Morpheus knows things that
I don't.

CYPHER (V.O.)
Yeah, but if he's wrong --

The final number pops into place --

TRINITY (V.O.)
Did you hear that?

CYPHER (V.O.)
Hear what?

SCREEN
Trace complete.  Call origin:
 312-555-0690

TRINITY (V.O.)
Are you sure this line is clean?

CYPHER (V.O.)
Yeah, course I'm sure.

We MOVE STILL CLOSER, the ELECTRIC HUM of the green
numbers GROWING INTO an OMINOUS ROAR.

TRINITY (V.O.)
I better go.

CYPHER (V.O.)
Yeah.  Right.  See you on the other side.

She hangs up as we PASS THROUGH the numbers, entering the
netherworld of the computer screen.

Where gradually the sound of a police radio grows around
us.

RADIO (V.O.)
Attention all units.  Attention
all units.

Suddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find
ourselves in --


INT.  CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT

The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way
across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms
as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving
patterns of permanent shadow.

We FOLLOW four armed POLICE officers using flashlights as
they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves
on either side of room 303.

The biggest of them violently kicks in the door --

The other cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before
them.

BIG COP
Police!  Freeze!

The room is almost devoid of furniture.  There is a fold-
up table and chair with a phone, a modern, and a powerbook
computer.  The only light in the room is the glow of the
computer.

Sitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is
TRINITY; a woman in black leather.

BIG COP
Get your hands behind your head!

Trinity rises.

BIG COP
Hands behind your head!  Now!  Do
it!

She slowly puts her hands behind her head.


EXT.  CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT

A black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the
police cruisers.

AGENT SMITH and AGENT BROWN get out of the car.

They wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night.  They
are also always hardwired; small Secret Service earphones
in one ear, its cord coiling back into their shirt
collars.

AGENT SMITH
Lieutenant?

LIEUTENANT
Oh shit.

AGENT SMITH
Lieutenant, you were given
specific orders --

LIEUTENANT
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme
that Juris-my dick-tion and you
can cran it up your ass.

AGENT SMITH
The orders were for your protection.

The Lieutenant laughs.

LIEUTENANT
I think we can handle one little
girl.

Agent Smith nods to Agent Brown as they start toward the
hotel.

LIEUTENANT
I sent two units.  They're
bringing her down now.

AGENT SMITH
No, Lieutenant, your men are dead.


INT.  CHASE HOTEL

The Big Cop flicks out his cuffs, the other cops holding
a bead.  They've done this a hundred times, they know
they've got her, until the Big Cop reaches with the cuff
and Trinity moves --

It almost doesn't register, so smooth and fast, inhumanly
fast.

The eye blinks and Trinity's palm. snaps up and the nose
explodes, blood erupting.  The cop is dead before he
begins to fall.

And Trinity is moving again --

Seizing a wrist, misdirecting a gun, as a startled cop
FIRES --

A head explodes.

In blind panic, another airs his gun, the barrel, a fixed
black hole --

And FIRES --

Trinity twists out of the way, the bullet missing as she
reverses into a roundhouse kick, knocking the gun away.

The cop begins to scream when a jump kick crushes his
windpipe, killing the scream as he falls to the ground.

She looks at the four bodies.

TRINITY
Shit.


EXT.  CHASE HOTEL

Agent Brown enters the hotel, while Agent Smith heads for
the alley.


INT.  CHASE HOTEL

Trinity is on the phone, pacing.  The other end is
answered.

MAN (V.O.)
Operator.

TRINITY
Morpheus!  The link was traced!  I
don't know how.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
I know.  Stay calm.

TRINITY
Are there any agents?

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Yes.

TRINITY
Goddamnit!

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
You have to focus.  There is a
phone.  Wells and Laxe.  You can
make it.

She takes a deep breath, centering herself.

TRINITY
All right --

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Go.

She drops the phone.


INT.  HALL

She bursts out of the room as Agent Brown enters the hall,
leading another unit of police.  Trinity races to the
opposite end, exiting through a broken window onto the
fire escape.


EXT.  FIRE E5CAPE

In the alley below, Trinity sees Agent Smith staring at
her.  She can only go up.


EXT.  ROOF

On the roof, Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over
the parapet, leading the cops in pursuit.

Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, her
moverents so clean, gliding in and out of each jump,
contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops.

Agent Brown, however, has the same unnatural grace.

The METAL SCREAM of an EL TRAIN is heard and Trinity
turns to it, racing for the back of the building.

The edge falls away into a wide back alley.  The next
building is over 40 feet away, but Trinity's face is
perfectly calm, staring at some point beyond the other
roof.

The cops slow, realizing they are about to see something
ugly as Trinity drives at the edge, launching herself
into the air.

From above, the ground seems to flow beneath her as she
hangs in flight

Then hitting, somersaulting up, still running hard.

COP
Motherfucker -- that's impossible!

They stare, slack-jawed, as Agent Brown duplicates the
move exactly, landing, rolling over a shoulder, up onto
one knee.

Just below the building are the runbling tracks of
riveted steel.  The TRAIN SCREECHES beneath her, a
rattling blur of gray metal.  Trinity junps, landing
easily.

She looks back just as Agent Brown hurls through the air
barely reaching the last car

Agent Brown stands, yanking out a gun.

Trinity is running hard as BULLETS WHISTLE past her head.

Ahead she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point
where the train has begun to turn, there is --

A window; a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick
building.

Trinity zeroes in on it, running as hard as she can, her
speed compounded by the train.  The SCREAM of the STEEL
rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the
turn.

Trinity hurtles into the empty night space, her body
leveling into a dive.  She falls, arms covering her head
as --

The whole world seems to spin on its axis --

And she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then
falls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down
stairs bleeding, broken --

But still alive.

Through the smashed window, she glimpses Agent Brown,
still on the train, his tie and coat whipping in the
wind; stone-faced, he touches his ear piece as the train
slides him past the window.

Trinity tries to move.  Everything hurts.

TRINITY
Get up, Trinity.  You're fine.
Get up -- just get up!

She stands and limps down the rest of the stairs.


EXT.  STREET

Trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and, at the
end of the block, in a pool of white street light, she
sees it.

The telephone booth.

Obviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk,
focusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the PHONE
begins to RING.

Across the street, a garbage truck suddenly u-turns, its
TIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates.

Trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the
telephone booth as if taking aim.

Gritting through the pain, she races the truck --

Slamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly
bright, bearing down on the box of Plexiglas just as --

She answers the phone.

There is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking
mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk --

Barreling through the booth, bulldozing it into a brick
wall, smashing it to Plexiglas pulp.

After a moment, a black loafer steps down from the cab of
the garbage truck.  Agent Smith inspects the wreckage.
There is no body.  Trinity is gone.

His jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration.
AGENT JONES walks up behind him.

AGENT SMITH
Did you get anything from the
room?

AGENT JONES
Their next target.  The name is
Neo.

The handset of the pay phone lays on the ground,
separated in the crash like a severed limb.

AGENT SMITH
We'll need a search running.

AGENT JONES
It's already begun.

We are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, CLOSER
and CLOSER, UNTIL the smooth gray plastic spreads out
like a horizon and the small HOLES WIDEN until we fall
through one --

Swallowed by the darkness that becomes --

A computer screen.

We are on-line, inside a chat room called "The Matrix."
It is an exklusive web-site where hackers hang out.

SCREEN
JACKON:  I heard Morpheus has been
on this board.
SUPERASTIC:  Morpheus doesn't even
exist and the Matrix is nothing
but an advertising gimmick 4 a new
game.
TIMAXE:  All I want to know is
Trinity really a girl?
LODIII:  87  of all women on line
are really men.
QUARK:  The Matrix is a euphemism
for the government.
SUPERASTIC:  No, The Matrix is the
system controlling our lives.
TIMAXE:  You mean MTV.
SUPERASTIC:  I mean Sega.
FOS4:  ALL HAIL SEGA!!!

We drift back from the electric conversation entering --


INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

It is a studio apartirent that seems overgrown with
technology.

Weed-like cables coil everywhere, duct-taped into
thickets that wind up and around the legs of several
desks.

Tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay
open like an autopsied corpse.

We turn towards the center of this rat-nest of
technology, following the slurping and crunching of
cereal.  We pass an open box of Capln Crunch as we find --

NEO, a younger man who knows more about living inside a
computer than living outside one.

NEO
Fuckin' idiots don't know shit.

He finishes his cereal and is about to disconnect when an
anonynous message slices onto the screen.

SCREEN
Do you want to know what the
Matrix is, Neo?

Neo is frozen when he reads his name.

SCREEN
SUPERASTIC:  Who said that?
JACKON:  Who's Neo?
GIBSON:  This is a private board.

If you want to know, follow the
white rabbit.

NEO
What the hell...

SCREEN
TIMAXE:  Someone is hacking the
hackers!
FOS4:  It's Morpheus!!!!!
JACKON:  Identify yourself.

Knock, knock, Neo.

A chill runs down his spine and when someone KNOCKS on
his door he almost jumps out of his chair.

He looks at the door, then back at the computer but the
message is gone.

He shakes his head, not completely sure what happened.
Again, someone knocks.

Cautiously, Neo approaches the door.

VOICE (O.S.)
Hey, Tommy-boy!  You in there?

Recognizing the voice, he relaxes and opens it.  ANTHONY,
who lives down the hall, is standing outside with a group
of friends.

NEO
What do you want, Anthony?

ANTHONY
I need your help, man.  Desperate.
They got me, man.  The shackles of
fascism.

He holds up the red notice that accompanies the Denver
boot.

NEO
You got the money this time?

He holds up two hundred dollars and Neo opens the door.
Anthony's girlfriend, DUJOUR, stops in front of Neo.

DUJOUR
You can really get that thing off,
right now?

ANTHONY
I told you, honey, he may look
like just another geek but this
here is all we got left standing
between Big Brother and the New
World Order.


EXT.  STREET

A police officer unlocks a yellow metal boot from the
wheel of an enormous oldsmobile.


INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

They watch from the window as the cops, silently,
robotically, climb into their van.

ANTHONY
Look at 'em.  Automatons.  Don't
think about what they're- doing or
why.  Computer tells 'em what to
do and they do it.

FRIEND  l
Thc banality of evil.

He slaps the money in Neo's hand.

ANTHONY
Thanks, neighbor.

DUJOUR
Why don't you come to the party
with us?

NEO
I don't know.  I have to work
tomorrow.

DUJOUR
Come on.  It'll be fun.

He looks up at her and suddenly notices on her black
leather motorcycle jacket dozens of pins:  bands,
symbols, slogans, military medals and --

A small white rabbit.

The ROOM TILTS.

NEO
Yeah, yeah.  Sure, I'll go.


INT.  APARTMENT

An older Chicago apartment; a series of halls connects a
chain of small high-ceilinged rooms lined with heavy
casements.

Smoke hangs like a veil, blurring the few lights there
are.

Dressed predominantly in black, people are everywhere,
gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like
jungle cats around a tree.

Neo stands against a wall, alone, sipping from a bottle
of beer, feeling completely out of place, he is about to
leave when he notices a woman staring at him.

The woman is Trinity.  She walks straight up to him.

In the nearest room, shadow-like figures grind against
each other to the pneumatic beat of INDUSTRIAL MUSIC.

TRINITY
Hello, Neo.

NEO
How did you know that --

TRINITY
I know a lot about you.  I've been
wanting to meet you for some time.

NEO
Who are you?

TRINITY
My name is Trinity.

NEO
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The
Trinity that cracked the I.R.S.
Kansas City D-Base?

TRINITY
That was a long time ago.

NEO
Gee-zus.

TRINITY
What?

NEO
I just thought... you were a guy.

TRINITY
Most guys do.

Neo is a little embarrassed.

NEO
Do you want to go sorewhere and
talk?

TRINITY
No.  It's safe here and I don't
have much time.

The MUSIC is so loud they must stand very close, talking
directly into each other's ear.

NEO
That was you on the board tonight.
That was your note, wasn't it?

TRINITY
I had to gamble that you would see
and they wouldn't.

NEO
Who wouldn't?

TRINITY
I can't explain everything to you.
I'm sure that it's all going to
seem very strange, but I brought
you here to warn you, Neo.  You
are in a lot of danger.

NEO
What?  Why?

TRINITY
They're watching you.  Something
happened and they found out about
you.  Normally, if our target is
exposed we let it go.  But this
time, we can't do that.

NEO
I don't understand --

TRINITY
You came here because you wanted
to know the answer to a hacker's
question.

NEO
The Matrix.  What is the Matrix?

TRINITY
Twelve years ago I met a man, a
great man, who said that no one
could be told the answer to that
question.  That they had to see
it, to believe it.

Her body is against his; her lips very close to his ear.

TRINITY
He told me that no one should look
for the answer unless they have to
because once you see it,
everything changes.  Your life and
the world you live in will never
be the same.  It's as if you wake
up one morning and the sky is
falling.

There is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels
the words like a drug, seeping into him.

TRINITY
The truth is out there, Neo.  It's
looking for you and it will find
you, if you want it to.

She takes hold of him with her eyes.

TRINITY
That's all I can tell you right
now.  Good-bye, Neo.  And good
luck.

NEO
Wait.  Who was it?  Who was the
man?

She leans close, her lips alrost touching his ear as she
whispers.

TRINITY
You know who.

She turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall
of bodies.

A SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the music,
pressing in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we --

CUT TO:


INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT

The sound is an ALARM CLOCK, slowly dragging Neo to
consciousness.  He strains to read the clock face:
9:15 A.M.

NEO
Shitshitshit.


EXT.  SKYSCRAPER

The downtown office of CorTechs, a software development
company.


INT.  CORTECHS OFFICE

The main offices are along each wall, the windows
overlooking downtown Chicago.

RHINEHEART, the ultimate company man, lectures Neo
without looking at him, typing at his computer
continuously.

Neo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding
outside, dragging their rubber squeegees down across the
surface of the glass.

RHINEHEART
You have a problem, Mr. Anderson.
You think that you're special.
You believe that somehow the rules
do not apply to you.

He stops, glancing over his glasses at Neo, who turns in
time.

RHINEHEART
Obviously, you are mistaken.

His long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard.

RHINEHEART
This company is one of the top
software companies in the world
because every single employee
understands that they are a part
of a whole.  Thus, if an employee
has a problem, the company has a
problem.

He turns again.

RHINEHEART
The time has come to make a
choice, Mr. Anderson.  Either you
choose to be at your desk on time
from this day forth, or you choose
to find yourself another job.  Do
I make myself clear?

NEO
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.  Perfectly
clear.

INT.  NEO'S CUBICLE

The entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a
labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of
elevators.

Neo slumps down into his chair.  A TALL EMPLOYEE stands
up in the adjacent cubicle, leaning over the partition.

TALL EMPLOYEE
What did he say?

NEO
If I was late again, I'm going to
be fired.

He smirks.

TALL EMPLOYEE
Well, it was nice working with
you.

Neo glares at him, as he sinks down.

VOICE (O.S.)
Thomas Anderson?

Neo turns and finds a FEDERAL EXPRESS MAN at his cubicle
door.

NEO
Yeah.  That's me.

Neo signs the electronic pad and the Fedex guy hands him
the softpak.

FEDEX
Have a nice day.

He opens the bag.  Inside is a CELLULAR PHONE.  It seems
the instant it is in his hand, it RINGS.  Unnerved, he
flips it open.

NEO
Hello?

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Hello, Neo.  This is Morpheus.

Neo's knees give and he falls into his chair.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
I had hoped for this conversation
to take place under less adverse
conditions, but you can never
count on hope, can you, Neo?

NEO
... no.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
I've been watching you, Neo, and I
want to meet you.  I don't know if
you're ready to see what I want to
show you, but unfortunately, we
have run out of time.  They're
coming for you, Neo.  And I'm not
sure what they're going to do.

NEO
Who's coming for me?

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Stand up and see for yourself.

NEO
Right now?

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Yes.  Now.

Neo starts to stand.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Do it slowly.  Slowly.  The elevator.

His head slowly peeks up over the partition.

At the elevator, he sees Agent Brown and Agent Jones
leading a group of cops.  A female employee turns and
points out Neo's cubicle.

Neo ducks.

NEO
Holy fuckin' shit!

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Yes.

One cop stays at the elevator, the others follow the
agents.

NEO
What the fuck do they want with
me?!

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
I'm not sure.  But, if you don't
want to find out, you better get
out of there.

NEO
How?!

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
I can guide you out, but you have
to do exactly what I say.

The agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
The cubicle across from you is
empty.

NEO
But what if...?

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Go!  Now!

Neo lunges across the hall, diving into the other cubicle
just as the agents turn into his row.

Neo crams himself into a dark corner, clutching the phone
tightly to him.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Stay here for a moment.

The agents enter Neo's empty cubicle.  A cop is sent to
search the bathroom.

Morpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
A little longer...

Brown is talking to the tall employee.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
When I tell you, go to the end of
the row to the first office on the
left, stay.as low as you can.

Sweat trickles down his forehead.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Now.

Neo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he
freezes right behind a cop who has just turned around.

Staying crouched, he sneaks away, down the row, SHOOTING
across the opening to the first office on the left.

The room is empty.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Good.  Now there is a window.
Open it.

NEO
How do you know all this?

Morpheus laughs quietly.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
The answer is coming, Neo.

He opens the window.  The window howls into the room.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Outside, there's a scaffold.  You
can use it to get to the roof.

Leaning out the window, he sees that the scaffold is
several offices away.

NEO
No! It's too far away.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
There's a small ledge.  It's a
short climb.  You can make it.

Neo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a
concrete chasm.

NEO
No way, no way, this is crazy.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Don't be controlled by your fear,
Neo.  There are only two ways out
of this building.  One is that
scaffold.  The other is in their
custody.  You take a chance either
way.  I leave it to you.

CLICK.  He hangs up.  Neo looks at the door, then back at
the scaffold.

NEO
This is insane!  Why is this
happening to me?  What did I do?
I'm nobody.  I didn't do anything.
Fuck! Fuck!  Fuck!

He climbs up onto the window ledge.  Hanging onto the
frame, he steps onto the small ledge.

The scaffold seems even farther away.

NEO
I'm going to die.

The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building,
knocking Neo off balance.  Recoiling, he clings harder to
the frame, and the phone falls out of his hand.

He watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him.

NEO
This is insane.  I can't do this!
Forget it!

He climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the
door.

NEO
I didn't do anything!


EXT.  SKYSCRAPER

The agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving
doors, forcing his head down as they push him into the
dark sedan.

Trinity watches in the rear view mirror of her
motorcycle.

TRINITY
Shit.

INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA MONITOR

A wide angle view of a white roon, where Neo is sitting at
a table alone.

We MOVE INTO the monitor, ENTERING the room as if the
monitor were a window.

At the same moment, the door opens and the agents enter.

Smith sits down across from Neo.  A thick manila envelope
slaps down on the table between them.

Neo glances at the name on the file: "Anderson, Thomas
A."

AGENT SMITH
As you can see, we've had our eye
on you for some time now, Mr.
Anderson.

He opens the file.  Paper rattle marks the silence as he
flips several pages.  Neo cannot tell if he is looking at
the file or at him.

AGENT SMITH
It seems that you have been living
two lives.  In one life, you are
Thomas A. Anderson, program writer
for a respectable software
company.  You have a social
security number, you pay your
taxes and you help your land lady
carry out her garbage.

The pages continue to turn.

AGENT SMITH
The other life is lived in
computers where you go by the
hacker alias Neo, and are guilty
of virtually every computer crime
we have a law for, including the
unauthorized use of the D.M.V.
system for the removal of
automobile boots.

Neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.

AGENT SMITH
One of these,lives has a future.
One of them does not.

He closes the file.

AGENT SMITH
I'm going to be as forthcoming as
I can be, Mr. Anderson.  You are
here because we need your help.

He removes his sunglasses; his eyes are an unnatural ice-
blue.

AGENT SMITH
We know that you have been
contacted by a certain individual.
A man who calls himself Morpheus.
Whatever you think you know about
this man is irrelevant to the fact
that he is wanted for acts of
terrorism in more countries than
any other man in the world.  He is
considered by many authorities to
be the most dangerous man alive.

He leans closer.

AGENT SMITH
My colleagues believe that I am
wasting my time with you, but I
believe you want to do the right
thing.  It is obvious that you are
an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson,
and that you are interested in the
future.  That is why I believe you
are ready to put your past
mistakes behind you and get on
with your life.

Neo tries to match his stare.

AGENT SMITH
We are willing to wipe the slate
clean, to give you a fresh start
and all we are asking in return is
your cooperation in bringing a
known terrorist to justice.

Neo nods to himself.

NEO
Yeah.  Wow.  That sounds like a
real good deal.  But I think I
have a better one.  How about I
give you the finger --

He does.

NEO
And you can cram that file up your
Secret Service sphincter.

Agent Smith puts his glasses back on.

AGENT SMITH
You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson.

NEO
You ain't seen nothing yet.

AGENT SMITH
The irony of your situation is
that you have no choice.

NEO
You can't scare me with this
gestapo crap.  I know my rights.
I want my phone call.

Agent Smith smiles.

AGENT SMITH
And tell me, Mr. Anderson, what
good is a phone call iy you are
unable to speak?

The question unnerves Neo and strangely, he begins to
feel the muscles in his jaw tighten.

The standing agents snicker, watching Neo's confusion
grow into panic.

Neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly
seal shut, melding into each other until all trace of his
mouth is gone.

Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents
restrain him holding him in the chair.

AGENT SMITH
You are going to help us, Mr.
Anderson, whether you want to or
not.

Smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt.

From a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a
long, fiber-optic wire tap.

Neo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over
his exposed abdomen.  Horrified, he watches as the
electronic device animates, become an organic creature
that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm.

Thin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into
Neo's navel.  He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature
which looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --

Before it begins to burrow its, tail thrashing as it
worms its way inside.


INT.  NEO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Screaming, Neo bolts upright in bed.

He realizes that he is home.  Was it a dream?  His mouth
is normal.  His stomach looks fine.  He starts to take a
deep, everything-is-okay breath, when --

The PHONE RINGS.

It almost stops his heart.  It CONTINUES RINGING,
building pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed,
sucking him in with an almost gravitational force.

He answers it, saying nothing.

MORPHEUS (V.O.).
This line is tapped, so I must be
brief.

NEO
The agents --

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
They got to you first, but they've
underestimated how important you
are.  If they knew what I know,
you would probably be dead.

Neo feels sick.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
I don't know what you are thinking
right now but I want you to
understand that I will not give up
on you until you give up on me.

Neo's throat cracks, dry as the Sahara.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Do you still want to meet?

NEO
... Yes.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Take the Howard line south.

CLICK.  He closes his eyes, unsure of what he has done.


EXT.  EL TRAIN

An EL TRAIN RAGES against its metal rails.


INT.  TRAIN

It is three a.m., and the train carries the usual urban
night crawlers.  Neo sits alone, eyes shifting, watching
everything nervously.

There is a METAL BANG and TRAIN CLATTER fills the car as
the door is opened.

Neo turns and sees a large man enter.  He is wearing
sunglasses and a black leather jacket.  His name is APOC
and he walks straight at Neo.

APOC
Come with me.

Neo stands just as the door at the opposite end opens and
two police officers rush in, drawing their guns.

Apoc grabs Neo, muscling him to the nearest exit.  There
is no upcoming station.

Apoc yanks the emergency brake and the train buckles
against its own speed.  The cops are thrown back.  Neo
slams against the metal rail.

The doors open onto nothing and just when Neo regains his
balance, Apoc shoves him backwards --

He flies out from the train, arms windrilling as he falls
from, the raised tracks --

Hurtling towards a busy city street when, out of nowhere,
a truck races under him and --

He crashes into a large dumpster-bed filled with empty
boxes.


INT.  TRUCK BED

Still shaking his head, Neo realizes he is not alone.  A
man named Cabie is aiming a big gun at him.  Trinity is
next to him, talking into a cellular phone.

TRINITY
We got him.  Call the chop-shop.

She hangs up.

TRINITY
Listen to me, Neo.  You have to,
trust us.

She tears off a long strip of black duct-tape and reaches
for his face.

NEO
What are you doing?

TRINITY
This has to be done for your
protection and ours.

She seals his eyes shut with the tape.

TRINITY
You can't understand right now,
but if you're not one of us,
you're one of them.


EXT.  LOWER WACKER

A featureless black van glides up to a staircase that
curls down from the city's surface.

trinity guides the blind Neo down the steps.  The back of
the van slaps open, revealing a young, skinny man who
looks to be still in his teens, wearing an outfit that is
a cross between a surgeon and a telephone repair man.

His name is GIZMO and he smiles lewdly at Trinity,
exposing his teeth that are wired with weird-looking
braces.

GIZMO
Va va va voom.  Still the hottest
software around.

TRINITY
Hello, Gizmo.

Neo hears the voices around him.

GIZMO
This is really the guy?  The guy
that Morpheus thinks --

TRINITY
Yeah.

GIZMO
But he's so old.

TRINITY
Are you going to help us or aren't
you?

GIZMO
Hacksaw.  Load up the copper-top
and let's get the hell outta here.

Hacksaw is a huge man in a leather welder's apron.  He
shoulders Neo and hauls him into the van.

A moment later the green lights of Lower Wacker curve
over the tinted windshield as the van rushes through the
underworld.


INT.  VAN

The chop-shop is filled with electronic gadgets, wired to
meters and monitors.  There are shelves lined with
medical supplies and rows of hanging tools, knives,
cleavers, and stainless steel clamps.

Neo is strapped down to an ambulance cart, listening
nervously as Gizmo gets to work.

GIZMO
Okay, first we take a little look
under the hood.

He pulls up the goggles hanging at his neck and they
blink to life with tiny halogen lights and lenses irising
to varying levels of magnification.

GIZMO
You're going to feel a little
prick.

He inserts acupuncture-like needles into Neo's lower
abdomen.  The needles are wired to video monitors.
Hacksaw pilots the fiber-optic lens.

NEO
What are you doing?

TRINITY
We think you're bugged.  We can't
take you to Morpheus until you're
clean.

GIZMO
There it is.

On a monitor, we see the bug nestled in among Neols large
intestines.

GIZMO
Hit him with 10 ccs of local.

Hacksaw loads a hypodermic needle and pumps an anesthetic
around Neols navel.

Using a device that looks like a miniature speculum,
Gizmo inserts a knuckled dental pick.  Typing into a
calculator keypad wired to the pick, he automates the
tip.

On the monitor, we watch it telescope out and the end
separate into a tiny hooked, metal claw.

GIZMO
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

The claw snags hold of the bug.

GIZMO
Gotcha!

But the bug reacts violently.  Neo screams as it wraps
itself around the soft tissue web of intestine.

GIZMO
Shit.

TRINITY
What's happening?

GIZMO
I don't know.  They've never done
that before.

Neo writhes in pain.

GIZMO
Hold him down.

NEO
Jesus!  God!

TRINITY
Do something!

GIZMO
I got it!  Maybe we can stun it.

TRINITY
Are you crazy?  That will kill
him.

We watch Neo, who can't see what they are talking about.

GIZMO
It'll work.  Come on, do it or
Hacksaw will.

NEO
Do what?

The instant he hears the word, he knows.

TRINITY
Clear.

NEO
Oh, shit --

The cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his
chest.  Gizmo wrestles with the bug.

GIZMO
Hit him again!

Again, the electricity convulses through him as Gizmo
yanks the speculum out.

GIZMO
Got it!

Trinity touches Neo, who is just beginning to breathe.
She eases the tape off his eyes.

TRINITY
Neo, are you okay?

He nods.

TRINITY
It's over.  We got it.

Hanging from the claw pick is the inanimate metal wire-
tap.

GIZMO
Nasty little bugger, ain't it?


INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE

The van stops in a deserted alley behind a forgotten
hotel.  The doors open and Trinity helps Neo get out.

TRINITY
Thanks for your help, Gizmo.

GIZMO
I just hope the man knows what
he's doing.

She nods then climbs out of the van.  Gizmo ogles the
tight leather pants.

GIZMO
Goddamn, what I wouldn't give for
a copy of that software.

Trinity turns around.

TRINITY
Gizmo, you don't have the hardware
to handle this software.

He howls with adolescent laughter as the van pulls away.
Trinity turns to Neo.

TRINITY
Let's go.  He's waiting.


INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE

It is a place of putrefying elegance, a rotting host of
urban maggotry.

Trinity leads Neo from the stairwell down the hall of the
thirteenth floor.  They stop outside room 1313.

TRINITY
This is it.

Neo can hear his own heart pounding.

TRINITY
Let me give one piece of advice.
Be honest.  He knows more than you
can possibly imagine.


INT.  ROOM 1313

Across the room, a dark figure stares out the tall
windows veiled with decaying lace.  He turns and his
smile lights up the room.

MORPHEUS
At last.

He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible
behind circular mirrored glasses.

He strides to Neo and they shake hands.

MORPHEUS
Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt
have guessed, I am Morpheus.

NEO
It's an honor.

MORPHEUS
Please.  Come.  Sit.

He nods to Trinity.

MORPHEUS
Thank you, Trinity.

She bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an
adjacent room.

They sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy-
leather chairs.

MORPHEUS
I imagine, right now, you must be
feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling
down the rabbit hole?

NEO
You could say that.

MORPHEUS
I can see it in your eyes.  You
have the look of a man who accepts
what he sees because he is
expecting to wake up.

A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.

MORPHEUS
Ironically, this is not far from
the truth.  But I'm getting ahead
of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo,
why are you here?

NEO
You're Morpheus, you're a legend.
Most hackers would die to meet
you.

MORPHEUS
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we
both know there's more to it than
that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?

NEO
No.

MORPHEUS
Why not?

NEO
Because I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

MORPHEUS
I know exactly what you mean.

Again, that smile that could cut glass.

MORPHEUS
Let me tell you why you are here.
You are here because you have the
gift.

NEO
What gift?

MORPHEUS
I've watched you, Neo.  You do not
use a computer like a tool.  You
use it like it was part of
yourself.  What you can do inside
a computer is not normal.  I know.
I've seen it.  What you do is
magic.

Neo shrugs.

NEO
It's not magic.

MORPHEUS
But it is, Neo.  It is.  How else
would you describe what has been
happening to you?

He leans forward.

MORPHEUS
We are trained in this world to
accept only what is rational and
logical.  Have you ever wondered
why?

Neo shakes his head.

MORPHEUS
As children, we do not separate
the possible from the impossible
which is why the younger a mind is
the easier it is to free while a
mind like yours can be very
difficult.

NEO
Free from what?

MORPHEUS
From the Matrix.

Neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of
himself.

MORPHEUS
Do you want to know what it is,
Neo?

Neo swallows and nods his head.

MORPHEUS
It's that feeling you have had all
your life.  That feeling that
something was wrong with the
world.  You don't know what it is
but it's there, like a splinter in
your mind, driving you mad,
driving you to me.  But what is
it?

The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.

MORPHEUS
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all
around us, here even in this room.
You can see it out your window, or
on your television.  You feel it
when you go to work, or go to
church or pay your taxes.  It is
the world that has been pulled
over your eyes to blind you from
the truth.

NEO
What truth?

MORPHEUS
That you are a slave, Neo.  That
you, like everyone else, was born
into bondage...
... kept inside a prison that you
cannot smell, taste, or touch.  A
prison for your mind.

Outside, the WIND BATTERS a loose PANE of glass.

MORPHEUS
Unfortunately, no one can be told
what the Matrix is.  You have to
see it for yourself.

NEO
How?

MORPHEUS
Hold out your hands.

In Neo's right hand, Morpheus drops a red pill.

MORPHEUS
This is your last chance.  After
this, there is no going back.

In his left, a blue pill.

MORPHEUS
You take the blue pill and the
story ends.  You wake in your bed
and you believe whatever you want
to believe.

The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.

MORPHEUS
You take the red pill and you stay
in Wonderland and I show you how
deep the rabbit-hole goes.

Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, with the
moisture growing in his palms.

MORPHEUS
Remember that all I am offering is
the truth.  Nothing more.

Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill.  The
Cheshire smile returns.

MORPHEUS
Follow me.

He leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with
high-tech equipment, glowing ash-bliie and electric green
from the racks of monitors.

Trinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter.

CYPHER
Shit.

TRINITY
I knew he would.

Cypher saddles up to Morpheus, talking in a hushed tone
away from, Neo.

CYPHER
Morpheus, I know what you believe
but I think this is a mistake.
We're rushing him.  He's old.  I'm
afraid he might pop.

MORPHEUS
Haven't I always told you, Cypher,
not to let fear control your life.
Apoc, are we on-line?

Neo recognizes the large man from the El train.

APOC
Almost.

He and Trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex
system of monitors, modules and drives.

NEO
Apoc?  You wrote the Four Horsemen
Virus.

APOC
That's right.

MORPHEUS
Neo, time is always against us.
Will you take a seat there?

In the center of the room sits a chair.  Near the chair
is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked.

MORPHEUS
I imagine you know sonething about
virtual reality.

Neo sits and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode
disks to his head, arns, and the back of his neck.

NEO
A little.

MORPHEUS
Tell me about it.

NEO
Essentially, it's a hardware
system that uses an apparatus;
headgear, gloves and whatever to
make you feel that you are in a
computer program.

MORPHEUS
If the virtual reality apparatus,
as you called it, was wired to all
of your senses and controlled them
completely, would you be able to
tell the difference between the
virtual world and the real world?

NEO
You might not, no.

MORPHEUS
No, you wouldn't.

Neo whispers to Trinity.

NEO
You did all this?

She nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears.
They are wired to an old hotel phone.

MORPHEUS
The pill you took is part of a
trace program.  It's going to make
things feel a bit strange.

Distantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc POUNDING
on a KEYBOARD.  Sweat beads his face.  His eyes blink and
twitch when he notices the mirror.

Wide-eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself, a
webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the
mirror were becoming liquid.

NEO
Shit...

Cypher works with Apoc checking reams of phosphorescent
data.  Trinity monitors Neo's electric vital signs.

Neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers
disappear beneath the rippling surface.

Quickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror
stretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored-taffy
stuck to his fingertips.

NEO
What is this?  Mescaline?

MORPHEUS
Just relax, Neo.

The strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away,
until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break.

With the TINKLING of GLASS, shimmering snowflakes
of electric-blinking mercury fall, hit the ground, and
fade.

He looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored
icicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running
like wax down his fingers, spreading across his palms
where he sees his face reflected.

NEO
Uh-oh...

TRINITY
It's going into replication.

MORPHEUS
Apoc?

APOC
Still nothing.

Morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number.

MORPHEUS
Tank, we're going to need the
signal soon.  Stay calm, Neo.

The mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up
his arns like hundreds of insects.

NEO
It's cold.

The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic,
tipping his head as though he were sinking into the
mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.

NEO
It's all over me --

Morpheus is right next to him, with the phone.

TRINITY
I got a fibrillation!

CYPHER
I knew it, I knew it...

MORPHEUS
Shit!  Apoc?

Streams of mercury run from Neo's nose.

APOC
Targeting... almost there.

An ALARM, on Trinity's monitor ERUPTS.

TRINITY
He's going into arrest!

CYPHER
He's gonna pop!

APOC
Lock!  I got him!

MORPHEUS
Now, Tank now!

His eyes tear with mirror, rolling up and closing as a
high-pitched ELECTRIC SCREAM ERUPTS in the headphones --

It is a piercing SHRIEK like a computer calling to
another computer --

Neo's body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were
pulled into the holes of the phone

Sucked into his SCREAM and swallowed by darkness.


INT.  POWER PLANT - CLOSE ON MAN'S BODY

Floating in a womb-red amnion.

His body spasms, fighting against the thick gelatin.

Metal tubes, surreal versions of hospital tubes, obscure
his face.  Other lines like IVs are connected to limbs
and cover his genitals.

He is struggling desperately now.  Air bubbles into the
Jell-O but does not break the surface.

Pressing up, the surface distends, stretching like a red
rubber coccon.

Unable to breathe, he fights wildly to stand, clawing at
the thinning elastic shroud --

Until it ruptures, a hole widening around his mouth as he
sucks for air.  Tearing himself free, he emerges from the
cell.

It is Neo.

He is bald and naked, his body slick with gelatin.
Dizzy, nauseous, he waits for his vision to focus.

He is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled
with red gelatin, the surface of which has solidified
like curdled milk.

The IVs in his arms are plugged into outlets that appear
to be grafted to his flesh.

He feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the
back of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial
plugged and locked into the base of his skull.

He tries to pull it out but it would be easier to pull
off a finger.

To either side he sees other tube-shaped pods filled with
red gelatin; beneath the wax-like surface, pale and
motionless, he sees other human beings.

Fanning out in a circle, there are more.  All connected
to a center core, each capsule like a red, dimly glowing
petal attached to a black metal stem.

Above him, level after, level, the stem rises seemingly
forever.  He moves to the foot of the capsule and looks
out.

The image assaults his mind.

Towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible
heights, disappearing down into a dim murk like an
underwater abyss.

His sight is blurred and warped, exaggerating the
intensity of the vision.  The sound of the PLANT is like
the sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of
Leviathan.

Below Neo, a petal detaches from the stem, bearing away
the body of an old man like an automated barge even as a
new pod rises up and plugs itself into the empty space.

Inside the new capsule, its surface more translucent and
pinkish in color, Neo sees a small baby.

From above, a machine drops directly in front of Neo.

He swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him.

It is almost insect-like in its design; beautiful
housings of alloyed metal covering organic-like systems
of hard and soft polymers.

A black particle beam washes over Neo, he reacts in pain
as the scanner seems to expose the nervous system wired
to the coaxial cable at his cerebral cortex.

At the back of the neck, the cable lock spins and opens,
disengaging.

The cable pulls itself free, a long clear plastic needle
and cerebrum-chip slides from the anterior of Neols skull
with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid.  The other
connective hoses snap free and snake away as --

The back of the unit opens and a tremendous vacuum, like
an airplane door opening, sucks the gelatin and then Neo
into a black hole.


INT.  WASTE LINE

The pipe is a waste disposal system and Neo falls,
sliding with the clot of gelatin.

Banking through pipe spirals and elbows, flushing up
through grease traps clogged with cily clunps of
cellulite.

Neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the
flow of waste.

The metallic cable then lifts, pulling him up into the
belly of the futuristic flying nachine, hovering inside
the sewer main line.


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

The metal harness opens and drops the half-conscious Neo
onto the floor.

Human hands and arms help him up as he finds himself
looking straight at Morpheus.

Trinity and Apoc.  And others, dressed in bizarre, high-
tech combat gear.

Morpheus smiles.

MORPHEUS
Welcome to the real world, Neo.

Neo passes out.

FADE TO BLACK.

We have no sense of time.  We hear VOICES whispering.

MAN (O.S.)
Do you think Morpheus is right?
Do you think he could be the One?

WOMAN (O.S.)
It doesn't matter now.  But if
he's wrong...

FADE IN:

NEO'S POV

Neo's eyes flutter open.  We see Trinity's face above us,
angelic in the fluorescent glow of a light stick.


ANGLE ON NEO

NEO
... am I dead?

TRINITY
Far from it.

FADE TO BLACK.


FADE IN:


ANGLE ON NEO

He opens his eyes again, something tingling through him.
He focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of
acupuncture-like needles wired to a strange device.

DOZER
He needs a lot of work.

MORPHEUS
I know.

Dozer and Morpheus are operating on Neo.

NEO
What are you doing?

MORPHEUS
Your muscles have atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

Fluorescent light sticks burn unnaturally bright.

NEO
Why do my eyes hurt?

MORPHEUS
You've never used them before.

Morpheus takes his sunglasses off and puts them on Neo.
Neo lays back.

MORPHEUS
Rest, Neo.  The answers are
coming.


INT.  NEO'S ROOM

Neo wakes up from a deep sleep, feeling better.  He is
wearing a black tank top and shorts.

He begins to examine himself.  There is a futuristic IV
plugged into the jack in his forearm.  He pulls it out,
staring at the grafted outlet.

He feels his bald head.  His fingers find and explore the
large outlet in the base of his skull.

Just as he starts to come unglued, Morpheus opens the
door.

NEO
Morpheus, what's happened to me?
What is this place?

MORPHEUS
More important than what is when?

NEO
When?

MORPHEUS
You believe the year is 1997 when
in fact it is much closer to 2197.
I can't say for certain what year
it is because we honestly do not
know.

The wind is knocked from Neo's chest.

NEO
That's not possible.

MORPHEUS
I promised you the truth, Neo, and
the truth is that the world you
were living in was a lie.

NEO
How?

MORPHEUS
I'll show you.


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

Like a sleepwalker, Neo follows Morpheus through the ship.

MORPHEUS
This is my ship, the
Nebuchadnezzar.  It's a
hovercraft.  Small like a
submarine.  It's dark.  It's
cramped and cold.  But it's home.

They climb a ladder up to the main deck.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Everyone is there.

MORPHEUS
This is the main deck.  You know
most of my crew.

Trinity smiles and nods.

MORPHEUS
The ones you don't know.  That's
Mouse and Switch.  The two big
guys are Tank and Dozer.

The names and faces wash meaninglessly over Neo.

MORPHEUS
And this, this is the Core.  This
is where we broadcast our pirate
signal and hack into the Matrix.

It is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment.  Vines of
coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic
battery slabs, a black portable satellite dish and banks
of little systems and computer monitors.

At the center of the web, there are six ectoskeleton
chairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness.

Near the circle of chairs is the control console and
operator's station where the network is monitored.

MORPHEUS
Help him, Trinity.

Neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs.

MORPHEUS
Do you remember when I asked you
about an apparatus that could turn
a virtual reality into reality?

Neo nods.

MORPHEUS
It's right here.

He touches Neo's head.

MORPHEUS
And it's accessed here.

Neo feels Morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack
at the back of his neck.  The cable has the same kind of
cerebellum chip we saw inside the plant.

MORPHEUS
This will feel a little weird.

There are several disturbing NOISES as he works the
needle in.

We MOVE IN as Neo's shoulders bunch and his face tightens
into a grimace until a loud CLICK fires and his ears pop
like when you equalize them underwater.

He relaxes, opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling
of weightlessness inside another place --


INT.  CONSTRUCT

Neo is standing in an empty, blank-white space.

MORPHEUS
This is the Construct.

Startled, Neo whips around and finds Morpheus now in the
room with him.

MORPHEUS
It is our loading program.  We can
load anything from clothes, to
weapons, to training simulations.
Anything we need.

Morpheus walks past Neo and when Neo turns he sees the
two leather chairs from the hotel set up in front of a
large-screen television.

MORPHEUS
Sit down.

Neo stands at the back of the chair as Morpheus sits.

NEO
Right now, we're inside a computer
program?

MORPHEUS
Wild, isn't it?

Neo's hands run over the cracked leather.

NEO
This isn't real?

MORPHEUS
What is real?  How do you define
real?  If you're talking about
your senses, what you feel, taste,
smell, or see, then all you're
talking about are electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

He picks up a remote control and clicks ON the
TELEVISION.  We drift through the Windy City circa 1996.

MORPHEUS
This is the Chicago you know.
Chicago as it was at the end of
the twentieth century.  This
Chicago exists only as part of a
neural-interactive simulation that
we call the Matrix.

We GLIDE AT the television as he changes the channel.

MORPHEUS
You have been living inside
Baulliaurd's vision, inside the
map, not the territory.  This is
Chicago as it exists today.

The sky is an endless sea of black and green bile.  The
earth, scorched and split like burnt flesh, spreads out
beneath us as we ENTER the television.

MORPHEUS
'The desert of the real.'

In the distance, we see the ruins of a future Chicago
protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of
a long-dead corpse.

MORPHEUS
We are, right now, miles below the
earth's surface.  The only place
humans can survive outside the
Matrix is underground.

Still MOVING, we TURN and find Neo and Morpheus; the
chairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert.
Dizzy, Neo holds onto the chair.

NEO
What happened?

MORPHEUS
It started early in the twenty-
first century, with the birth of
artificial intelligence, a
singular consciousness that
spawned an entire race of
machines.

In his sunglasses, we see storm clouds gather.

MORPHEUS
At first all they wanted was to be
treated as equals, entitled to the
same human inalienable rights.
Whatever they were given, it was
not enough.

In the circular window of the glasses, EXPLOSIONS light
up a bloody battle field.

MORPHEUS
We don't know who struck first.
Us or them.  But sometime at the
end of the twenty-first century
the battle was joined.

We MOVE INTO his glasses and the war surrounds us.

MORPHEUS
The war raged for generations and
turned the face of our planet from
green and blue to black and red.

At last we see the Sentinels; killing machines that are
at once terrifying and beautiful.  They have an organic
architecture like a microbiotic organism, that is
perpetually in motion.

The Sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier,
splitting open the soft, stearing meat inside.

MORPHEUS
It scorched and burned the sky.
Without the sun, the machines
sought out a new energy source to
survive.

The Sentinel locks up, as heat lightning of black ink
bursts against the sky, spreading into a permanent cloud
of stain.

MORPHEUS
They discovered a new form of
fusion.  All that was required to
initiate the reaction was a small
electric charge.  Throughout human
history we have been dependent on
machines to survive.  Fate, it
seems, is not without a sense of
irony.

We return to the power plant that Neo escaped from where
we see human beings looking almost blissful in their
gelatin cocoons.

MORPHEUS
The human body generates more bio-
electricity than a 120-volt
battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s
of body heat.

Outside, spreading all around the power plant, beneath a
breathing greenhouse, are the growing fields.

MORPHEUS
We are, as an energy source,
easily renewable and completely
recyclable, the dead liquified and
fed intravenously to the living.

Huge farm-like reapers are harvesting the crop.

MORPHEUS
All they needed to control this
new battery was something to
occupy our mind.

We see inside a clear tubular husk.  Floating in viscous
fluid, there is a human fetus; its soft skull already
growing around the brain-jack.

MORPHEUS
And so they built a prison out of
our past, wired it to our brains
and turned us into slaves.

We PULL BACK to find the image is now on the television
and we are again inside the white space of the Construct.

NEO
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not
possible!

MORPHEUS
I didn't say that it would be
easy, Neo.  I just said that it
would be the truth.

The room without walls begins to spin.

NEO
Stop!  Let me out!  I want out!


INT.  MAIN DECK

His eyes snap open and he thrashes against the chair,
trying to rip the cable from the back of his neck.

NEO
Get this thing out of me!

TRINITY
Easy, Neo.  Easy.

Dozer holds him while Trinity unlocks it.  Once it's out,
he tears away from them, falling as he trips free of the
harness.

NEO
Don't touch me!  Get away from me!

On his hands and knees, he reels as the world spins.
Sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull
as if his brian had been put into a centrifuge.

CYPHER
He's going to pop!

Vomiting violently, Neo pitches forward and blacks out.


INT.  NEO'S ROOM

He blinks, regaining consciousness.  The room is dark.
Neo is stretched out on his bed.

NEO
I can't go back, can I?

Morpheus sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far
corner.

MORPHEUS
No.  But if you could, would you
really want to?

Neo isn't sure of that answer.

MORPHEUS
I feel that I owe you an apology.
There is a rule that we do not
free a mind once it reaches a
certain age.  It is dangerous.
They have trouble letting go..
Their mind turns against them.
I've seen it happen.  I broke the
rule because I had to.

He stares into the darkness, confessing as much to
himself as Neo.

MORPHEUS
When the Matrix was first built
there was a man born inside that
had the ability to change what he
wanted, to remake the Matrix as he
saw fit.  It was this man that
freed the first of us and taught
us the secret of the war; control
the Matrix and you control the
future.

He pauses.

MORPHEUS
When he died, the Oracle at the
temple of Zion prophesied his
return and envisioned an end to
the war and freedom for our
people.  That is why there are
those of us that have spent our
entire lives searching the Matrix,
looking for him.

Neo can feel his eyes on him.

MORPHEUS
I did what I did, because I
believe we have been brought here
for a reason, Neo.  You are here
to serve a purpose, just as I am
here to serve mine.

NEO
I told you I don't believe in
fate.

Morpheus smiles, leaning towards hin.

MORPHEUS
But I do, Neo.  I do.

He stands up.

MORPHEUS
Get some rest.  You're going to
need it.

NEO
For what?

MORPHEUS
Your training.



INT.  HOVERCRAFT

There is no morning; there is only darkness and then the
fluorescent light sticks flicker on.


INT.  NEO'S ROOM

Neo is awake in his bed, staring up at the lights.  The
door opens and TA.NK steps inside.

TANK
Morning.  Did you sleep?

NEO
No.

TANK
You will tonight.  I guarantee it.
I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.

He offers his hand and Neo shakes it.  He notices that
Tank doesn't have any jacks.

NEO
You don't have...

TANK
Any holes?  Nope.  Me and my
brother Dozer, we are 100 percent
pure, old fashioned, home-grown
human.  Born free.  Right here in
the real world.  Genuine child of
Zion.

NEO
Zion?

TANK
Zion is the place, man.  You'll
see it one day.  Last human city.
All we got left.

Tank smiles.

TANK
Goddamn, I got to tell you I'm
fairly excited to see what you are
capable of.  I mean if Morpheus is
right and all.  We're not supposed
to talk.about any of that, but if
you are, well then this is an
exciting time.  We got a lot to do
so let's get to it.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Neo is plugged in, hanging in one of the suspension
chairs.

TANK
We're supposed to load all these
operations programs first, but
this is some major boring shit.
Why don't we start something a
little fun?

Tank smiles as he plops into his operator's chair.  He
begins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro
discs.

TANK
How about sore combat training?

Neo reads the label on the disk.

NEO
Jiujitsu?  I'm going to learn
jujitsu?

Tank slides the disk into Neo's supplement drive.

NEO
No way.

Smiling, Tank punches the "load" code.

His body jumps against the harness as his eyes clamp
shut.  The monitors kick wildly as his heart pounds,
adrenaline surges, and his brain sizzles.

An instant later his eyes snap open.

NEO
Holy shit!

TANK
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready
for more?

NEO
Hell yes!


INT.  MAIN DECK - CLOSE ON COMPUTER MONITOR - LATER

as grey pixels slowly fill a small, half-empty box.  It
is a meter displaying how much download time is left.

The title bar reads:  "Combat Series 10 of 12," file
categories flashing beneath it:  Savate, Jujitsu, Ken Po,
Drunken Boxing...

Morpheus walks in.

MORPHEUS
How is he?

Tank looks at his watch, rubs his eyes.

TANK
Ten hours straight.  He's a
machine.

Neo's body spasms and relaxes as his eyes open, breath
hissing from his lips.  He looks like he just orgasmed.

He locks at Morpheus.

NEO
This is incredible.  I know Kung
Fu.

Morpheus sits in the drive chair next to hin.  He nods to
Tank.

MORPHEUS
Show me.


INT.  DOJO

They are standing in a very sparse japanese-style dojo.

MORPHEUS
This is a sparring program,
similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.  Consider this your
first lesson.

He assumes a fighting stance.

MORPHEUS
Attack me.

Neo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until
he gives a short cry and launches a furious attack.

It is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and
feet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack
--

But each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed.


INT.  MAIN DECK

While their minds battle in the programmed reality, the
two bodies appear quite serene, suspended in the drive
chairs.

Tank monitors their life systems noticing that Neo is
wildly and chaotically lit up as opposed to the slow and
steady rhythm of Morpheus.


INT.  MESS HALL

Dinner is up.  Everyone is eating bowls of single-cell
protein.  It has a cottage cheese consistency.

MOUSE bursts in the room.

MOUSE
Morpheus is fighting Neo!

All at once they bolt for the door.


INT.  DOJO

Neo's face is knotted, teeth clenched, as he hurls
himself at Morpheus.

MORPHEUS
Good.  Adaption.  Improvisation.
But your weakness isn't your
technique.

Morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen.
His feet and fists are everywhere taking Neo apart.  For
every blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --

Neo falls.

Panting, on his hands and knees, blood spits fror, his
mouth speckling the white floor of the Dojo.

MORPHEUS
How did I beat you?

NEO
You -- You're too fast.

MORPHEUS
Do you think my being faster,
stronger has anything to do with
my muscles in this place?

Neo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath.

MORPHEUS
Do you believe that's air you are
breathing now?

Neo squints at him.

MORPHEUS
If you can free your mind, the
body will follow.

Neo stands, nodding.

MORPHEUS
Again.

Their fists fly with  pneumatic speed.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Everyone is gathered behind Tank, watching the fight,
like watching a game of Mortal Combat.

CABLE
Jeezus Keerist!  That boy is fast!

MOUSE
You ever seen anyone that fast
that soon, Tank?

TANK
Never.

APOC
Morpheus is right.  He's got to be
the one.


INT.  DOJO

The speed of the blows rises like a drum solo that seems
impossible to sustain.  Neo's face sheds its mask of calm
with a scream.

He wants to beat Morpheus bad.

Finally a single blow catches Morpheus on the side of the
head, knocking his glasses off.


INT.  MAIN DECK

There are several gasps.

MOUSE
I don't believe it!


INT.  DOJO

Morpheus rubs his face.

MORPHEUS
You are angry with me.

Neo pants.

NEO
I, uh... maybe.

MORPHEUS
It's all right.  It's natural.

NEO
I feel better.

MORPHEUS
Good, good.  Anger is a gift, Neo,
but it's a heavy one.

Morpheus smiles.

MORPHEUS
Tank, load the jump program.

Neo straightens as the dojo DISSOLVES away like a curtain
lifting, leaving the two men now standing on a building
rooftop in a city skyline.

MORPHEUS
You have to learn to let go of
that anger.  You must let go of
everything.

A WIND HOWLS, whipping Morpheus' long coat to the side.

MORPHEUS
You must empty yourself to free
your mind.

Morpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop.
And jumps.  He sails through the air, his coat billowing
out behind him like a cape --

Somersaults once and lands on the rooftop across the
street.

NEO
Shit.

Neo looks down at the street twenty floors below, then at
Morpheus an impossible fifty feet away.

NEO
Okie dokie.

He takes a deep breath.

NEO
Yeah.  Free my mind.  Right.  No
problem.

He concentrates.  Runs.


INT.  MAIN DECK

They are transfixed.

CABLE
He's gonna make it.

APOC
No way.  Not possible.

MOUSE
No one's ever made their first
jump.

SWITCH
What if he does?

APOC
He won't.

TANK
It's never been done.

Trinity stares at the screen, her fists clenching as she
whispers.

TRINITY
Come on.


EXT.  ROOFTOP

Summoning every ounce of strength in his legs, Neo
launches himself into the air in a single maniacal shriek
--

But comes up drastically short.

His eyes widen as he plummets.  Stories fly by, the
ground rushing up at him, but as he hits --

The ground gives way, stretchinp like a trapeze net.

He bounces and flips, slowly coming to a rest, flat on
his back.

He laughs, a bit unsure, wiping the wind-blown tears from
his face.

Morpheus exits the building and helps him to his feet.

MORPHEUS
Everyone falls the first time.

Neo nods quietly.

MORPHEUS
If you never know failure, how can
you know success?


INT.  MAIN DECK

They break up.

MOUSE
What does it mean?

CABLE
It doesn't mean anything.

CYPHER
Everyone falls, right, Trinity?

But Trinity has left.

Neo's eyes open as Tank eases the plug out.  He tries to
move and groans, cradling his ribs.

While Tank helps Morpheus, Neo spits blood into his hand.

NEO
I thought it wasn't real.

Neo stares at the blood.

NEO
If you are killed in the Matrix,
you die here?

MORPHEUS
The body cannot live without the
mind.


INT.  NEO'S ROOM

Trinity enters from the hall, carrying a try of food.

TRINITY
Neo, I saved you some dinner --

She sees him passed out on the bed.  She sets the tray
down and pulls the blanket over him.

She pauses, her face close to his, then inhales lightly,
breathing in the scent of him, before slowly pulling away.

It seems the moment she closes the door, he wakes with a
start, unsure of where he is.  After a moment, he gets
out of bed.


INT.  HALL

The ship is quiet and dark.  Everyone is asleep.


INT.  MAIN DECK

The core glows with monitor light.  Cypher is in the
operator's chair as Neo cones up behind him.

CYPHER
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the
bejeezus out of ne.

NEO
Sorry.

CYPHER
No, it's all right.

NEO
What are you doing?

CYPHER
Midnight watch.

Neo's eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens
that seem alive with a constant flow of data.

NEO
Is that... ?

CYPHER
The Matrix?  Yeah.

The monitors are packed with bizarre codes and equations.

CYPHER
You want a drink?

He pours Neo a drink from a large plastic jug.

CYPHER
I'll tell you, I feel for you,
man.  I really do.  Most of us
were still young, just punks, when
Morpheus jacked us.  But you, you
had a real life.

Neo takes a sip and it almost kills him.  Cypher pounds
on his back.

CYPHER
Good shit, huh?  Dozer makes it.
It's good for two things:
degreasing engines and killing
brain cells.

Red-faced, Neo finally stops coughing.

CYPHER
Did he tell you why he did it?

Neo nods.

CYPHER,
I'll be the didn't tell you that
this wasn't the first time he
thought he found the One.

Neo shakes his head as Cypher fills his cup and laughs.

CYPHER
Let me give you a piece of advice.
Between you and me, if Morpheus
says you can fly, I wouldn't go
jumping out any windows to find
out if he's right.  Understand?

Cypher raises his drink.  Neo swallows another throat-
scorching mouthful.

CYPHER
Welcome to the real world!


INT.  RESTAURANT (MATRIX) - NIGHT

CHAMBER MUSIC and the ambiance of wealth soak the room as
we watch a serrated knife saw through a thick, gorgeous
steak.

CYPHER
That's what he said to me nine
years ago.

The meat is so perfect, charred on the outside, oozing
red juice from the inside, that it could be a dream.

CYPHER
The real world.  Ha, what a joke.

We recognize the grating voice, the insidious laugh.

CYPHER
You know what real is?  I'll tell
you what real is.

A fork stabs the cube of meat and we FOLLOW it UP TO the
face of Cypher.

CYPHER
Real is just another four-letter
word.

He laughs, shoving the steak into his mouth.

The restaurant is located on the top floor of a Chicago
skyscraper where the view is breathtaking and the menu
has no prices.

Sitting across from Cypher is Agent Smith.

AGENT SMITH
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

Cypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his
teeth.

CYPHER
Mmm, so, so fucking good.

Smith watches him shovel another hunk of meat into his
mouth.

CYPHER
You know, I know that this steak
doesn't exist.  I know when I put
it in my mouth, the Matrix is
telling my brain that it is juicy
and delicious.  After nine years,
do you know what I've realized?

Pausing, he examines the meat skewered on his fork.  He
pops it in, eyes rolling up, savoring the tender beef
melting in his mouth.

CYPHER
Ignorance is bliss.

AGENT SMITH
Then we have a deal?

CYPHER
I don't want to remember nothing.
Nothing!  You understand?  And I
want to be rich.  Someone
important.  Like an actor.  You
can do that, right?

AGENT SMITH
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

Cypher takes a deep drink of wine.

CYPHER
All right.  You get my body back
in a power plant, reinsert me into
the Matrix and I'll get you what
you want.

AGENT SMITH
Access codes to Zion.

CYPHER
I told you, I don't know them.
But I can give you the man who
does.

AGENT SMITH
Morpheus.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Sweat dapples his lip as Neo snaps out of the construct
coma.

NEO
Jeez, I was wondering about that.

TANK
What?

NEO
Why I was bald here but not in the
Matrix.

TANK
R.S.I.

NEO
Residual self image.

TANK
Good.  Now what's this?

He points to one of Neo's monitors.

NEO
Life systems monitor, glucose
levels.

TANK
What's that?

NEO
Main power supply to the core.

He follows Tank to the operator's station where he points
to a red key-switch.

TANK
How about this?

NEO
Mainframe self-destruct.  Uses all
remaining power to generate an...
E.M.P?

TANK
Electromagnetic pulse.  Our best
weapon against the machines.  The
problem is if someone is still in
the Matrix when that thing goes
off, they're not coming back.

Neo nods as Morpheus comes up behind them.

MORPHEUS
How's he doing?

TANK
We just finished the operation
programs and he's showing great
retention.

MORPHEUS
Good.  I want everyone alerted to
12-hour stand-by.  We're going in.
Neo, it's time for you to know why
you're here.

Morpheus walks away.

NEO
What's he talking about?

TANK
He's taking you into the Matrix to
see her.

NEO
See who?

TANK
The Oracle.

Neo looks down at the monitor teeming with Matrix data
that seems to coalesce, equations giving way to images as
a METAL SCREAM RISES BECOMING --


EXT.  CHICAGO (MATRIX) - DAY

An El train.


INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

The room is empty, heavy curtains covering windows.  It
looks as if it hasn't been touched in years.  In the
bedroom with the cracked oval mirror an old black PHONE
begins to RING.

In the mirror, we first glimpse them and as we keep
TURNING, the room fills with equipment and the team.

Morpheus answers the phone.

MORPHEUS
We're in.

He hangs up.

MORPHEUS
Mouse and Cable hold the exit.
Let's go.


INT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY

Neo follows the others down the stairwell that winds
around an antique elevator shaft.

NEO
Did you have to do this?

TRINITY
Yeah.

NEO
What did she tell you?

TRINITY
Lots of things.

NEO
Any of them true?

Trinity looks at him, then looks away.

TRINITY
Some of them.

GIZMO
Were they good or bad?

TRINITY
There's no point in worrylng.
Whatever is going to happen is
going to happen.

They cross the old lobby.  Switch and Apoc stop at the
doors.

MORPHEUS
We should be back in an hour.


EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

Neo squints into the sun that seems unnaturally bright.
He is the only one without sunglasses.

MORPHEUS
Do you now understand what it
means when we say, if you're not
one of us, you're one of them?

NEO
The agents.  They're sentient
programs.  They can commandeer any
software hardwired to the
mainframe.

MORPHEUS
Anyone that is still in a power
plant.  That is why we try to be
invisible in the Matrix.

NEO
The best hacking is always
traceless.

Cypher and Trinity move away from them, securing the
perimeter.  As Cypher passes a garbage can, he
surreptitiously drops something inside.

It is a cellular phone and we watch the blue display as
the LINE CONNECTS.

An early 1970s, black Lincoln Continental emerges from a
corrugated roll-up garage.  Morpheus and Neo get in.


INT.  LINCOLN CONTINENTAL (MATRIX) - DAY

An enormous man is waiting for them.  A wad of chewing
tobacco bulges his cheek.  He spits into a Coke can.

MOJO
Morpheus, been a long time coming.

MORPHEUS
You're looking well, Mojo.

Mojo coughs a brown, cankerous laugh, juice speckling his
chin and shirt.  He stares at Neo.

MOJO
You bringing us geriatrics now.
Morpheus?

He spits and laughs again.

MOJO
Guess you are locking for a
miracle.


EXT.  BAR (MATRIX) - DAY

The Continental pulls up to a bar in the kind of
neighborhood where every corner has a pair of eyes.


INT.  BAR (MATRIX) - DAY

A lightless, lower-class bar.  No one enters that is not
expected.

The front doors open in a brilliant burst of sunlight as
Mojo leads Morpheus and Neo inside.  Neo looks around,
his eyes adjusting to the darkness.

Mojo talks to the bartender, then looks over.

MOJO
All right, it's cool.  Go on back.

They weave their way to the back of the bar, the STICKY
FLOOR SNAPPING under their FEET.

A monolith of a man rises from his stool as they walk up.

REX
You're late.

He moves to the side, opening the heavy iron door behind
him.  They descend the basement staircase toward the
single bare bulb at the bottom, hanging above the only
door.


INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

A high-tech laptop and modem are set up on a stack of
milk crates.  Neo waits as Morpheus types in a series of
access codes.  After a moment the screen blinks, "Welcome
Morpheus."

Morpheus walks back to the same door they entered, but it
now leads into --


INT.  TEMPLE OF ZION (MATRIX) - DAY

The walls and floors are polished marble.  Neo follows,
his mouth agape.

NEO
What -- what happened?

MORPHEUS
This is the temple.  It is a part
of Zion's mainframe.  It's hidden
inside the Matrix so that we can
access it.

Two PRIESTESSES are waiting in the antechamber.

PRIESTESS
Hello, Morpheus.  We've been
expecting you.

MORPHEUS
Okay, you're on your own.  Go with
them.

They take Neo by the arm, leading him down a hall into
another room.

PRIESTESS
Wait here.  Among the other
Potentials.


INT.  ROOM OF POTENTIALS (MATRIX) - DAY

Neo enters and finally understands the attention given to
his age.  The Potentials are all little children.

The room feels at once like a Buddhist temple and a
kindergarten class.  The children's heads are either
shaved or thick with dreadlocks.  Some are playing,
others meditating or practicing their gift.

Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet
blocks.  A skinny BOY holds a SPOON which sways like a
blade of grass as he bends it with his rnind.

Neo crosses to him, sits.

The Boy smiles as Neo picks up a spoon and tries to
imitate him.  Despite his best efforts, Neo cannot make
it bend.

SPOON BOY
Your spoon does not bend because
it is just that, a spoon.  Mine
bends because there is no spoon,
just my mind.

Neo watches as it curls into a knot.

SPOON BOY
Link yourself to the spoon.
Become the spoon and bend
yourself.

Neo nods, again holding up his spoon.

NEO
There is no spoon.  Right.

He concentrates.  The spoon begins to bend just as the
Priestess touches his shoulder.

PRIESTESS
The Oracle will see you now.

Spoon Boy smiles.


INT.  SHRINE (MATRIX) - DAY

Neo enters nervously.  Beneath his feet is a path of the
zodiac leading to marbled stairs that rise to a dais and
a three-legged throne.

The throne is empty.

NEO
Hello?

A DISTANT FEMALE VOICE calls to him and he follows it up
the stairs.  At the top of the dais, he smells something
cooking.

Following the scent, he moves behind the pillars where he
finds an open door.

VOICE (O.S.)
Just come on in.

He walks through a vestibule where he sees a fabulous
moonstone headdress and velvet robes.  A second door
leads into --


INT.  ORACLE'S CHAMBERS (MATRIX) - DAY

It looks like a suburban tract house.

There is a lot of cozy furniture, a dining roon hutch
filled with china, shelves and tables crowded with
doilies, knick-knacks and ceramic brick-a-brack.

Neo follows the plastic carpet runner to the kitchen.

A WOMAN is huddled beside the oven, peering inside
through the cracked door.

NEO
Hello?

ORACLE (WOMAN)
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right
with you.

NEO
You're the Oracle?

ORACLE
Bingo.  I got to say I love seeing
you non-believers.  It's really a
relief.  All that pomp and
circumstances just plain tucker me
out.  Almost done.  Smell good,
don't they?

NEO
Yeah.

ORACLE
I'd ask you to sit down, but
you're not going to anyway.  And
don't worry about the vase.

NEO
What vase?

He turns to look around and his elbow knocks a VASE from
the table.  It BREAKS against the linoleum floor.

ORACLE
The vase.

NEO
Shit, I'm sorry.

She pulls out a tray of chocolate chip cookies and turns.
She is an older woman, wearing big oven mitts,
comfortable slacks and a print blouse.  She looks like
someone's grandma.

ORACLE
I said don't worry about it.  I'll
get one of my kids to fix it.

NEO
How did you know...?

She sets the cookie tray on a wooden hot-pad.

ORACLE
What's really going to bake your
noodle later on is, would you
still have broken it if I hadn't
said anything.

Smiling, she lights a cigarette.

ORACLE
You're cuter than I thought.  I
see why she likes you.

NEO
Who?

ORACLE
Not too bright, though.

She winks.

ORACLE
You know why Morpheus brought you
to see me?

NEO
I think so.

ORACLE
So? What do you think?  You think
you're the one?

NEO
I don't know.

She gestures to a wooden plaque, the kind every grandma
has, except that the words are in Latin.

ORACLE
You know what that means?  It's
Latin.  Means, 'Know thyself.'

She puts her cigarette down.

ORACLE
Well, let's have a look at you.

She widens his eyes, checks his ears, then feels the
glands in his neck.

ORACLE
Open your mouth.  Say, 'ahhh.'

She nods then looks at his palms.

ORACLE
Hmmm.  You sure got the gift, but
it's tricky.  I'd say the bad news
is, you're not the one.  Still got
a lot to learn.  Maybe next life.

NEO
What's the good news?

ORACLE
Same as the bad news, you're not
the one.

NEO
Is that it, then?

ORACLE
No.  Here.

She picks up the tray of cooling cookies.

ORACLE
You better take a cookie.  Got a
big day ahead of you.

He eyes her, then takes a cookie.

ORACLE
Make a believer out of you yet.


INT.  ANTECHAMBER (MATRIX) - DAY

Morpheus rises from a bench as the Priestess escorts Neo
out.  When they are alone, Morpheus puts his hand on
Neo's shoulder.

MORPHEUS
You don't have to tell me
anything, Neo, because I already
know what she said.

NEO
You do?

MORPHEUS
I brought you so that you could
hear it for yourself.  I knew it
would help.

Neo finishes his cookie.

MORPHEUS
No one will ever ask you because
it is a gift from her.  It is for
you and you alone.


EXT.  CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

Storm clouds shroud the streets as the sky turns
jaundice.

Cypher nervously glances down the surrounding streets.
He notices several unmarked white vans.

He mops the sweat from his forehead, when Trinity sees
the black Lincoln.

TRINITY
Here they come.


INT.  MAIN DECK

In the hovercraft, we see the sweat rolling down Cypher's
face and neck.

Tank is typing rapidly at the keyboard.

TANK
Weird.  This area never has this
much activity.


EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

Apoc opens the side door and they enter the hotel.


INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

Mouse's CELLULAR RINGS.

MOUSE
Welcome to Movie-Phone.

TANK (V.O.)
They're on their way.

MOUSE
Right.

The phone flips shut as he jumps up.

MOUSE
Let's get to work.


INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

Light filters down the throat of the building through a
caged skylight at the top of the open elevator shaft.
Four figures glide up the dark stairs that wind around
the antique elevator.

Neo notices a black cat, a yellow-green-eyed shadow that
slinks past them and pads quickly down the stairs.

A moment later, Neo sees another black cat that looks and
moves identically to the first one.

NEO
Whoa.  Deja vu.

Those words stop the others dead in their tracks.


INT.  MAIN DECK

The monitors suddenly glitch as though the Matrix had an
electronic seizure.

TANK
Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!


INT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

Trinity turns around, her face tight.

TRINITY
What did you just say?

NEO
Nothing.  Just had a little deja
vu.

TRINITY
What happened?  What did you see?

NEO
A black cat went past us and then
I saw another that looked just
like it.

TRINITY
How much like it?  Was it the same
cat?

NEO
It might have been.  I'm not sure.

Trinity looks at Morpheus, who listens quietly to the
rasping breath of the old building.

NEO
What is it?

TRINITY
A deja vu is usually a glitch in
the Matrix.  It happens when they
change something.

She also listens as the staccato BEAT of HELICOPTER
BLADES GROW ominously LOUDER.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Tank sees what was changed.

TANK
It's a trap!


INT.  STAIRCASE (MATRIX) - DAY

Morpheus looks up the stairs as a helicopter shadow
passes over the clouded glass.

MORPHEUS
Come on!


INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

Cable goes to the draped windows.

CABLE
Did you just feel something weird?

MOUSE
Yeah...

The CELLULAR RINGS.


INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

Heavy bolt-cutters snap through the main phone cable.


INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

Mouse answers the phone.

MOUSE
What's going on?

TANK (V.O.)
They cut the hard-line!  It's a
trap!  Get out!

Cable yanks open the curtain.

CABLE
Oh, no.

The windows are bricked up.


INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

The door to the roof explodes open as heavily-armed rnen
rush towards room 1313.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Tank watches helplessly.

TANK
No, no, no.


INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

The door slams open and the police force pours in, dozens
of assault rifles surrounding Mouse and Cable who are
armed with only handguns.

CABLE
Morpheus!  It's a trap --


INT.  STAIRS (MATRIX) - DAY

Morpheus stops as the scream is drowned by the REPORT of
MACHINE GUNS filling the building with a terrible fury.

TRINITY
Oh, God.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Mouse's body thrashes against its harness as --


INT.  ROOM 1313 (MATRIX) - DAY

BULLETS POUND him against the blood-splattered brick
window.  Gun smoke thickens the room, Cable blasting and
moving until --

The HAMMER CLICKS empty.  He screams as a DOZEN GUNS OPEN
FIRE, ripping him apart.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Blood spits from Cable's mouth, his body spasming, then
lying perfectly still.

The flat-line ALARM softly cries out from the life
MONITORS of the two dead men.


EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

More police cars arrive as cops break open the lobby
doors.


INT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY

Flying downstairs, Morpheus stops, hearing the police
swarming below.  He turns and rushes down the hall of the
eighth floor.  At the end of it, he finds the bricked-up
windows.

CYPHER
That's what they changed.  We're
trapped.  There's no way out.

The sound of heavy BOOT-STEPS close around them with the
mechanical sureness of a vice.

MORPHEUS
Give me your phone.

TRINITY
They'll be able to track it.

MORPHEUS
We have no choice.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Tank answers the call.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Tank, find a structural drawing of
this building and find it fast.

His fingers pound the keyboard.


INT.  LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

Flashlights probe the rotting darkness as the police
search every floor.


INT.  MAIN DECK

The diagram windows onto the screen.

TANK
Got it.

MORPHEUS (V.O.)
I need the main wet-wall.


INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

Agent Smith pauses, his hand going to his earpiece.


INT.  ROOM 808 (MATRIX) - DAY

Morpheus is guided by Tank.

TANK (V.O.)
Now left and that's it in front of
you.

MORPHEUS
Good.

He cuts off the phone.


INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

Agent Smith hears the LINE CLICK dead.

AGENT SMITH
Eighth floor.  They're on the
eighth floor.


INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

Agent Brown hears Smith on his earphone.

AGENT BROWTJ
Eighth floor!  Move!


INT.  STAIRWELL (MATRIX) - DAY

Cops flood the eighth floor, rushing everywhere.


INT.  ROOM 808 (MATRIX) - DAY

Several cops sweep through the room.  It is empty.  As
they pass the bathroom, we see a man-sized hole smashed
through the plaster and lathe.


INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

They are inside the main plumbing wall, slowly worming
their way down the greasy, black stack pipes.

Above them, light fills the hole they made to get inside.

INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

Brown turns to Smith.

AGENT BROWN
Where are they?


INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

The cops search in silence, straining for a clue, when
one hears SOMETHING STRANGE near the bathroom.


INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

Cypher has slipped and is wedged between the wall and
several thick supply pipes.


INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

The Cop leans in, his ear almost against the thin
membrane of plaster separating them.  He can hear
WHISPERS, HISSES and a GRUNT when --

The WALL suddenly bulges, SHATTER-CRACKING as the Cop
realizes --

COP
They're in the walls!


INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

Neo pulls Cypher free just as the Cop OPENS FIRE --

BULLETS PUNCHING shafts of light like swords into the box
of soot-black space.


INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

The Cop keeps FIRING, his flashlight strapped to his gun
barrel, lighting up the wall until --

A BULLET spits out his forehead.  Agent Smith watches the
BODY fall with a THUD.

AGENT SMITH
Are orders that hard to follow?
I'll say it again.  Morpheus must
be taken alive.  Understand?


INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

They're almost falling, they're climbing so fast.

Above them, plaster is smashed open as crunbling bits
shower down on them, filling the crawlway with dust.


INT.  ROOM 608 (MATRIX) - DAY

Agent Smith looks into the open wall, at the exposed
intestines of the building, and realizes where they are
going.

AGENT SMITH
How like a rodent.


INT.  WALL (MATRIX) - DAY

Just below, a RIFLE-BUTT SMASHES open the WALL, light
raking across the lathe.

COP
I got him!  I got him!

Trinity finds her gun first.  BULLET-HOLES POP out the
WALL as she STRAFES the room, sending cops diving for
cover.

They continue, Trinity exposed for a roment, when a
creeping cop smashes a fist through and grabs a fistful
of her hair.

He starts to yank her out when Neo kicks, his boot
bursting through plaster and splintering lathe, knocking
the Cop out.

They then quickly sink out of sight.


INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

This part of the basement, a dark concrete cavern, was
the main mechanical room.  There are four enormous
boilers, dinosaur-like technology that once pumped hot
water like arteries.

Black and bloody, they squeeze out from the ceiling into
the tangled web of pipes.

Their enemies are waiting for them.

Blinding lights cut open the darkness as gas-masked
figures FIRE GRENADE LAUNCHERS.

Smoke blossoms from the green-metal canisters.

Morpheus never stops moving.  Searching the floor, he
finds what.he needs; the cover of the catch basin.

Cypher watches him pry open the grate, when a gas can
bounces near him.

MORPHEUS
Come on!

Cypher seems to trip as the cloud envelops him.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Cypher's body begins to shiver uncontrollably.

TANK
Nerve gas.


INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

Morpheus watches Cypher disappear into the smoke then
follows the others down the wet-black hole.


INT.  CATCH BASIN (MATRIX) - DAY

They crawl through greasy black water in a three foot
diameter pipe that feeds into the sewer main.


INT.  BASEMENT (MATRIX) - DAY

Gas-masked apparitions find the open hole.


EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

Cypher is carried out, hand-cuffed, his body still
shaking, mucus bubbling out his nose.  As he is led past
Agent Smith, it almost seems that both men smile.

AGENT SMITH
We have them now.


INT.  SEWER MAIN (MATRIX) - DAY

Neo punches out the screen and then spills down into the
main water trough.

Oily water forms around them as they wade across the man-
made underground river, towards the service catwalk.

Neo is about to pull himself out when he sees them coming.

Flashlights and laser sites sweep at them as cops in
helmets and heavy armor, looking more nachine than human,
fill both ends of the tunnel.

There is a single manhole cover above them.

Morpheus whispers to Trinity.

MORPHEUS
You have to get Neo out.
Understand?  That's all that
matters now.

TRINITY
Morpheus, don't --

MORPHEUS
He must get out.  Do you
understand me?

She nods.

A font of water erupts as Morpheus leaps for the manhole
ladder, his coat flying open like the wings of a manta
ray.

COPS
There he is!  That's him!

Pools of light wash over him as he hauls himself to the
surface.

COP
He's heading for the street!

Trinity urges the others to follow her.  Grabbing Neo,
they wade quietly away from the chaos.


EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

Morpheus shoots out of the sewer but the police are
waiting for him.  The closest cop is armed with a
tranquilized gun.  He fires --

But Morpheus' is too fast, using the manhole cover as a
shield, blocking the darts, then --

Frisbee-ing it into the cop's armored chest, knocking him
off his feet.

The cops lunge at him but every part of his body is a
deadly weapon moving with impossible speed.

It seems he might fight his way out when he throws a
spinning back fist that is caught by --

Agent Smith.

AGENT SMITH
So, we meet at last.

MORPHEUS
And you are?

AGENT SMITH
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.

MORPHEUS
You all look the same to me.

AGENT SMITH
I've been waiting for this noment.

Faster than a snake spits, Morpheus cracks Smith with a
jaw-breaking right.

MORPHEUS
Oh, so have I.

Agent Smith smiles.


INT.  SEWER MAIN (MATRIX) - DAY

Trinity leads the others, fading into the darkness of the
tunnel, lit only with shafts of lights streaming through
the street drains as we RISE TOWARDS them --

THROUGH a grate INTO the fight.


EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

Smith and Morpheus exchange a furious serious of blows
that is witnessed but not believed by the surrounding
police.

Agent Smith delivers a punishing kick that staggers
Morpheus.

AGENT SMITH
You can't win.

Morpheus smiles.

MORPHEUS
I already have.

He stands up and drops his fists; a steely resolve in his
eyes.

AGENT SMITH
Take him.

Cops swarm over Morpheus.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Tank reaches out to the screen as if reaching for
Morpheus.

TANK
No!


EXT.  HOTEL LAFAYETTE (MATRIX) - DAY

Cuff ed and beaten, Morpheus is thrown into a caged
transport vehicle.  The DOOR CLANGS shut.

Agent Jones finds Agent Smith.

AGENT JONES
The others were lost.

AGENT SMITH
You've taken care of Reagan?

Agent Jones nods.

AGENT SMITH
Then the others do not matter.


EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

A manhole cover cracks open.  Two eyes peek out just as a
TRUCK RATTLES over it.  The THUNDER DOPPLERS AWAY and the
cover opens.

Neo, Trinity, Switch and Apoc climb out.  Trinity pulls a
water-logged phone from her pocket.

TRINITY
We need a phone.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Tank is again at the monitors, searching the Matrix.

TANK
We gotta find the others.  They're
still alive.

The PHONE RINGS.

TANK
Operator.

CYPHER (V.O.)
I need an exit!  Fast!

TANK
Cypher?  I thought they had you?


EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

Cypher is standing at a public phone.  Across the street
is the burning paddy wagon that appears to have collided
witli an oncoming car.

CYPHER
There was an accident.  A fucking
car accident.  All of a sudden.
Boom.  They're all dead.  I still
got the shakes but, Jesus,
someone's going to make a believer
out of me.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Dozer spots the wreck.

DOZER
There he is.

TANK
I got you.

CYPHER (V.O.)
Just get me outta here.


EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

TANK (V.O.)
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie.
An old appliance store.

Cypher hangs up and smiles as the fire trucks arrive.

CYPHER
An actor.  Definitely.


INT.  MAIN DECK

The PHONE RINGS.  Tank answers.

TANK
Operator.

TRINITY (V.O.)
Tank, it's me.


EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

They are outside a pawn shop.  Trinity has a new cellular.

TRINITY
We need an exit!

TANK (V.O.)
Gotcha.  You're not far from
Cypher.

TRINITY
Cypher, I thought --

TANK (V.O.)
So did we.  That boy's got nine
lives.  I sent him to Franklin and
Erie.

TRINITY
Got it.

She hangs up.


EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

Running, Cypher turns onto Erie.


INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

Dead machines, eviscerated and shrouded with dust lay on
metal shelves like bodies in a morgue.

Plywood covering a small window is ripped off and Cypher
crawls inside.

Deep in the back room, a PHONE that has not rung in years
begins to RING.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Tank punches the emit command.

TANK
Got him.

Cypher's body twitches in its harness, jerking itself
awake.  His eyes blink open.  Dozer unplugs him.

DOZER
System check looks fine.

Cypher stands, a raspy cough spewing from his lungs.


EXT.  STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

Trinity sees the appliance shop.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Cypher holds his chest.

DOZER
You okay?

CYPHER
Goddamn gas.  My lungs are killing
me.

He crosses to an overhead bin.

CYPHER
We got any pain killers?

DOZER
The first aid kit's over here.

As Dozer stoops for a cabinet, Cypher pulls back a heavy
blanket exposing a plasma rifle.


INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

Neo crawls through the window that Cypher opened.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Tank finishes loading the exit programs as Cypher rises
behind him, swinging the weapon at his back.

He looks over as Dozer turns with the first aid kit, a
look of frozen disbelief crossing his face --

DOZER
No!

Tank spins as red hot wads of PLASMA EXPLODE through his
chair and into his back.  Diving, a second BURST tears up
his side --

As Dozer shoots a look at the monitor where Tank was
working.  He stabs the enter command activating the exit
sequence and ducks under a BARRAGE of PLASMA FIRE-


INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

The PHONE begins to RING as the others crawl in.

SWITCH
God, I love that sound.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Dozer rolls up, grabbing a heavy crowbar from a box of
tools.

Cypher circles the drive chairs as the sights of the
plasma rifle find Dozer's face.

Dozer charges, screaming, and the PLASMA RIFLE SCREAMS
back.


INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

The PHONE is still RINGING.

TRINITY
You first,.Neo.

Neo answers the phone when there is a CLICK.  There is no
signal.  Nothing but silence.

TRINITY
What happened?

NEO
I don't know.  It just went dead.

Trinity listens to the dead line and takes out the
cellular.


INT. MAIN DECK

The operator PHONE begins to RING- Cypher steps over the
body of Tank and looks at the monitor.


INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

Trinity can almost feel him watching them.  Every
unanswered RING wrings her gut a little tighter, until --

CYPHER (V.O.)
Hello, Trinity.

TRINITY
Cypher?  Where's Tank?

CYPHER (V.O.)
He had an accident.

TRINITY
An accident?  What about Dozer?
Is Dozer there?


INT.  MAIN DECK

He walks over to Trinity's body, staring down at it
hanging in its coma-like stillness.

CYPHER
You know, for a long time, I
thought I was in love with you,
Trinity.  I used to dream about
you...

He nuzzles his face against hers, feeling the softness of
it.

CYPHER
You are a beautiful woman.  Too
bad things had to work out like
this.

We INTERCUT BETWEEN the appliance store and the main
deck.

TRINITY
You killed them.

APOC
What?!

SWITCH
Oh God.

Wearing Tank's operator headgear, Cypher moves among the
silent bodies.

CYPHER
In a way you're very lucky.  Most
people never know why they die.
One minute they're alive, the next
they're dead.  No warning.
Nothing.  That's why I thought
maybe I should tell you.  It
seemed the least I could do.

He stands over the body of Morpheus, as his anger boils
up out of him.

CYPHER
You see, the truth, the real,truth
is that the war is over.  It's
been over for a long time.  And
guess what?  We lost!  Did you
hear that?  We lost the war!

TRINITY
What about Zion?

CYPHER
Zion?  Zion is a part of this
delusion.  More of this madness.
That's why this has to be done.
It has to end.  Now and forever.

She suddenly sees the entire dark plan.

TRINITY
Oh rny God.  This is abzut Zion.
You gave them Morpheus for the
access codes to Zion.

Cypher walks away from Morpheus and bends down next to
Apoc's body.

CYPHER
You see, Trinity, we humans have a
place in the future.  But it's not
here.  It's in the Matrix.

TRINITY
The Matrix isn't real!

CYPHER
Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I
disagree.  I think the Matrix is
more real than this world.  I
mean, all I do is pull a plug
here.  But there, you watch a man
die.

He grabs hold of the cable in Apoc's neck, twists it and
yanks it out.

CYPHER
You tell me which is more real.

Apoc seems to go blind for an instant, a scream caught in
his throat, his hands reaching for nothing, and then
falls dead.  Switch screams.

CYPHER
Welcome to the real world, right?

He laughs.

TRINITY
Somehow, some way, you're going to
pay for this.

CYPHER
Pay for it?  I'm not even going to
remember it.  It'll be like it
never happened.  The tree falling
in the forest.  It doesn't make a
sound.

His hand slides around the neck of Switch as he takes
hold of her plug.

She suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as she
is murdered.

TRINITY
Goddamn you, Cypher!

CYPHER
Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just
the messenger.  And right now I'm
going to prove that the message is
true.

He stands over Neo.

CYPHER
If Morpheus was right, then
there's no way I can pull this
plug, is there?

She turns to Neo, eyes wide with fear, and he knows he is
next.

CYPHER
If he is the One, then in the next
few seconds there has to be some
kind of miracle to stop me.
Because if he dies like the others
that means Morpheus was wrong.
How can he be the One if he's
dead?

He takes hold of the cord when --

She hears an EXPLOSION and a scream.

Cypher is on the ground, his left leg blown off at the
knee.  He rolls over and finds Tank on the ground, and
the sights of the plasma rifle.

TANK
How's it feel, Cypher?  Knowing
you're about to die?

NEO
It's Tank!  He's alive.

Cypher lunges for Neo's plug just as Tank BLOWS his head
off.


INT.  APPLIANCE STORE (MATRIX) - DAY

They're both listening, trying to figure out what is
happening when the store PHONE starts to RING.

Trinity smiles, tears moistening her eyes as Neo throws
his arms around her.  For a moment, it looks as if they
might kiss before Trinity lets go.

TRINITY
We should, we should hurry.

NEO
Yeah.  Right.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Trinity's eyes open, a sense of relief surging through
her at the sight of the ship.  As Tank unplugs her, she
sees his charred wounds.

TRINITY
Tank, you're hurt.

TANK
I'll be all right.

TRINITY
Dozer?

Tank's face tightens.

TRINITY
I'm sorry, Tank.


EXT.  NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

A Japanese luxury hotel in downtown Chicago.

A military helicopter sets down on the roof.  Heavily
armed Marines begin to deploy.

Agent Jones gets out of the helicopter, flanked by
columns of Marines.  They open the roof access door
and enter the top-floor maintenance level of the hotel.


INT.  TOP FLOOR (MATRIX) - DAY

They get in the elevator.  At every door, at least two
Marines stop and post guard.


INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

They exit the elevator and walk to the Presidential
suite; the final two Marines post guard.


INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

Inside, he finds Agent Smith.

AGENT JONES
There is a problem.  Reagan has
failed to secure the hardware.

Agent Smith stares out the window.

AGENT SMITH
Never send a human to do a
machine's job.

AGENT JONES
But if Reagan has failed, why
haven't they pulled the plug?

AGENT SMITH
Haven't you learned by now, that
it is impossible to understand why
they do the things they do?

He turns.

AGENT SMITH
Continue as planned.  Trace his
signal to locate their position
and deploy an extermination unit.

Morpheus is handcuffed to a chair, stripped to the waist.
He is bleeding from numerous wounds and is pumped full of
serum, alternately shivering and sweating.  He is hooked
up to various monitors with white disk electrodes.

Agent Brown begins running a trace program.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Neo looks at Morpheus whose body is covered with a cold
sweat.

NEO
What are they doing to him?

TANK
They're cracking his mind.

NEO
How?

TANK
They inject virus-like serums to
break down the system.  It's like
cracking a computer.  All it takes
is time.

NEO
How much time?

TANK
Depends on the mind.  But
eventually, it will crack and his
alpha pattern will change from
this to this.

Tank punches several commands on Morpheus' personal unit.
The monitor waves change from a chaotic pattern to an
orderly symmetrical one.

TANK
When it does, Morpheus will tell
them anything they want to know.

NEO
The access codes to Zion.

TANK
If an agent got inside Zion's
mainframe he could do anything.
Disable the defense system. It
would be the end of us.

He looks up at Trinity who is pacing relentlessly.

TANK
We can't let that happen.  We have
to do it, Trinity.  Zion has to be
protected.

Trinity sees Cypher's dead body.  Rage overtakes her and
she starts kicking hin.

TRINITY
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!

TANK
We have to pull the plug.

TRINITY
No!

TANK
We don't have any other choice.

Those words are like using gasoline to put out a fire and
we watch the pain in her eyes burn into a blaze.  She
walks past him and gets into her chair.

TANK
Trinity, what are you doing?

TRINITY
I'm going in after him.

TANK
Morpheus could conform at any
minute --

TRINITY
If he does I'm sure you'll do what
has to be done.

TANK
You saw that place.  It's suicide.

She glares at him.

TANK
I know what Morpheus means to
you --

TRINITY
No.  No, I don't think you do.  If
you did, then you would know that
I'm not letting him go.  Not
without a fight, Tank.

She yanks her harness tight.

TRINITY
Not without a fight.


INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

Agent Smith stands in the bedroon of the enormous suite,
staring out the windows at the city, below, shimmering
with brilliant sunlight.

AGENT SMITH
Have you ever stood and stared at
it, Morpheus?  Marveled at its
beauty.  Its genius.  Billions of
people just living out their
lives... oblivious.

Agent Brown sucks a serum from a glass vial, filling a
hypodermic needle.

AGENT SMITH
Did you know that the first Matrix
was designed to be a perfect human
world?  Where none suffered, where
everyone would be happy.  It was a
disaster.  No one would accept the
program.  Entire crops were lost.

Agent Brown jams the needle into Morpheus' shoulder, and
plunges down.

AGENT SMITH
Some believed we lacked the
programming language to describe
your perfect world.  But I believe
that, as a species, human beings
define their reality through
suffering and misery.

Agent Brown studies the screens as the life signs react
violently to the injection.

AGENT SMITH
The perfect world was a dream that
your primitive cerebrum kept
trying to wake up from.  Which is
why the Matrix was re-designed to
this:  the peak of your
civilization.

He turns from the window.

AGENT SMITH
I say 'your civilization' because
as soon as we start thinking for
you, it really becomes our
civilization, which is, of course,
what this is all about.

He sits down directly in front of Morpheus.

AGENT SMITH
Evolution, Morpheus.  Evolution.

He lifts Morpheus' head.

AGENT SMITH
Like the dinosaur.  Look out that
window.  You had your time.

Morpheus stares hard at him, trying hard not to show the
pain racking his mind.

AGENT SMITH
The future is our world, Morpheus.
The future is our time.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Neo goes to his chair and begins strapping in.

TRINITY
What do you think you're doing?

NEO
You need help.  I'm coming with
you.

TRINITY
No.  No way.  Morpheus sacrificed
himself so you could escape.
There's no way you're going back
in.

NEO
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed that I'm something
that I'm not.

TRINITY
What?

NEO
I'm not the One, Trinity.  The
Oracle told me.

Trinity is stunned.

NEO
She said I had a gift but I still
had a lot to learn.  She told me
maybe next life.

TRINITY
Did you tell Morpheus?

NEO
Why?  It wouldn't mean anything.
He'd still believe what he wanted
to believe.  But Morpheus is the
one that matters.  He's more
important than me and we both know
it.

He straps in.

NEO
I may not be what Morpheus thinks
I am, but if I don't try to help
him, then I'm not even what I
think I am.

TRINITY
What are you?

NEO
His friend.

INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

Agent Smith sits casually across from Morpheus who is
hunched over, his body leaking and twitching.

AGENT SMITH
I'd like to share a revelation
that I've had during my time here.
It came to me when I tried to
classify your species.  I've
realized that you are not actually
mammals.

The life signs continue their chaotic patterns.

AGENT SMITH
Every mammal on this planet
instinctively develops a natural
equilibrium with the surrounding
environment.  But you humans do
not.  You move to an area and you
multiply and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed and
the only way you can survive is to
spread to another area.

He leans forward.

AGENT SMITH
There is another organism on this
planet that follows the same
pattern.  Do you know what it is?
A virus.

He smiles.

AGENT SMITH
Human beings are a disease, a
cancer of this planet.  You are a
plague.  And we are... the cure.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Trinity and Neo hang motionless in the suspension unit.
Tank is at the operations station.

TANK
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you
need?

TRINITY (V.O.)
Guns.  Lots of guns.

TANK
Coming right up.

He loads the weapons disk.


INT.  CONSTRUCT

Racks of weapons appear and Neo and Trinity arm
themselves.

TRINITY
No one has ever done anything like
this.

NEO
Yeah?

He snap cocks an Uzi.

NEO
That's why it's going to work.

INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

Agent Smith is again at the window.

AGENT SMITH
Why isn't the serum working?

AGENT BROWN
Perhaps we are asking the wrong
questions.

AGENT JONES
Or he doesn't know.

AGENT SMITH
Of course he knows.  He's
resisting.

AGENT BROWN
How?

AGENT SMITH
I don't know.  If I knew...

Agent Smith hides his knotting fist.  He is becoming
angry.  It is something that isn't supposed to happen to
agents.

AGENT SMITH
Leave me with him.

Agent Brown and Jones look at each other.

AGENT SMITH
Now!

INT.  MAIN DECK

Tank sits down beside Morpheus whose face is ashen like
someone near death.  He takes hold of his hand.

TANK
Hold on, Morpheus.  They're coming
for you.  They're coming.


EXT.  NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

A dark wind blows.


INT.  NIKO HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

In long, black coats, Trinity and Neo push through the
revolving doors.

Neo is carrying a duffel bag.  Trinity has a large metal
suitcase.  They cut across the lobby drawing nervous
glances.

Dark glasses, game faces.

Several plainclothes cops try to stop them.  They are met
by the MUTED SPIT of a SILENCED GUN and the RAZORED
WHISTLE of THROWING STARS.

The cops slump down to the marbled floor while Neo and
Trinity do not even break stride.


INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

Agent Smith leans close to Morpheus, whispering to him.

AGENT SMITH
Can you hear me, Morpheus?  I'm
going to be honest with you.

He removes his earphone, letting it dangle over his
shoulder.

AGENT SMITH
I hate this place.  This zoo.
This prison.  This reality,
whatever you want to call it, I
can't stand it any longer.  It's
the smell, if there is such a
thing.  I feel saturated by it.  I
can taste your stink and every
time I do, I fear that I've
somehow been infected by it.

He wipes sweat from Morpheus' forehead, coating the tips
of his fingers, holding them to Morpheus' nose.

AGENT SMITH
Repulsive, isn't it?

He lifts Morpheus' head, holding it tightly with both
hands.

AGENT SMITH
I must get out of here, I must get
free.  In this mind is tlie key.
My key.

Morpheus sneers through his pain.

AGENT SMITH
Once Zion is gone, there's no
need for me to be here.  Do you
understand?  I need the codes.  I
have to get inside Zion.  You have
to tell me how.

He begins squeezing, his fingers gouging into his flesh.

AGENT SMITH
Tell me!  Tell me!

The skull is about to shatter when Agents Jones and Brown
burst into the room.  Agent Smith releases Morpheus.

AGENT BROWN
What were you doing?

Agent Smith recovers, replacing his ear piece.

AGENT JONES
You don't know.

AGENT SMITH
Know what?

Agent Smith listens to his earphone, not believing what
he is hearing.


INT.  ELEVATORS (MATRIX) - DAY

They get in.  Trinity immediately drops and opens the
suitcase, wiring a plastique and napalm bomb.

Beneath their trench coats is an arsenal of weapons slung
from climbing harnesses.

Neo hits the emergency stop.  He pulls down part of the
false ceiling and finds the elevator shaft access panel.


INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

Agent Jones looks at Morpheus.

AGENT JONES
I think they're trying to save
him.


INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY

Neo ratchets down a clamp onto the elevator cable.  Both
of them lock on.  He looks up the long, dark throat of
the building and takes a deep breath.

NEO
There is no spoon.

Neo whips out his gun and presses it to the cable, lower
than where they attached themselves.

BOOM!  The CABLE SNAPS.

The counter-weights plummet, yanking Trinity and Neo up
through the shaft as --

The elevator falls away beneath them, distending space,
filling it with the sound of WHISTLING METAL as they soar
to the top.


INT.  LOBBY (MATRIX) - DAY

The ELEVATOR hits the botton.

BA-BOOM!

The massive EXPLOSION blows open the doors, fire clouds
engulfing the elevator section of the lobby.


INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

The Agents hear the BLAST AND FIRE ALARMS.

AGENT JONES
Lower level --

AGENT BROWN
They are actually attacking.


INT.  ELEVATOR SHAFT (MATRIX) - DAY

Hanging by a rope, Trinity hot-wires the panel for the
door.


INT.  TOP FLOOR (MATRIX) - DAY

Nervous, the Marines watch as the ELEVATOR "DINGS" softly
and slides open.

Black smoke rises out of the exposed shaft.

The nearest Marine eases to the edge, peering down at the
churning blaze engulfing the lower levels.

He does not see Trinity and Neo above him until it is too
late.

Krack!  Neo kicks, knocking the Marine flying down into
the shaft.

Before the others can react, Trinity flips out into the
hall, decking the nearest Marine.  Neo cracks another.

The fight is over before it begins.


INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

An enormous EXPLOSION THUNDERS above them, shaking the
building.  The ALARM SOUNDS, emergency sprinklers begin
showering the room.

Agent Smith smashes a table.

AGENT SMITH
Find them and destroy them!

Agent Jones nods and touches his ear piece.


EXT.  ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY

The roof-access tower is now engulfed in flames as Neo
and Trinity lay waste to a dozen more Marines.

Guns and knives, like extensions of their bodies used
with the same deadly precision as their feet and their
fists.

Across the roof, the pilot inside the army helicopter
watches the ferocious onslaught.

PILOT
I repeat, we are under attack!

Suddenly his face, his whole body dissolves, consumed by
spreading locust-like swarm, of STATIC as --

Agent Jones emerges.

Just as she drops the last Marine, Trinity sees what's
coming.

Neo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows what is
behind him.

Screaming, he whirls, GUNS filling his hands with
thought-speed.

Fingers PUMPING, SHELLS ejecting, dancing up and away, we
look through the sights and gun smoke at --

The Agent blurred with motion --

Until the HAMMERS CLICK against empty metal.

NEO
Trinity!

Agent Jones charges.

NEO
... help.

His GUN BOOMS as we enter the liquid space of --

Bullet-time.

The AIR SIZZLES with wads of lead-like angry flies as Neo
twists, bends, ducks just between them.

Agent Jones still running, narrows the gap, the BULLETS
coming faster until --

Neo bent impossibly back, one hand on the ground as a
spiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder.

He starts to scream as another digs a red groove across
his thigh.

He has only time to look up, to see the barrel when Agent
Jones, standing over him, pulls the TRIGGER the final
time.

CLICK.  Empty.

Neo rolls, reaching for another gun when around-house
kick snaps his jaw.  Agent Jones grabs the gun and levels
it at Neo.

AGENT JONES
Only human...

Suddenly Agent Jones stops.  Something is wrong.  He
scans the roof.  Trinity is gone.

Immediately, he whirls around and turns straight into the
muzzle of her .45 --

Jammed right into his head.

TRINITY
Dodge this, motherfucker!

BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  The body flies back with a flash of
mercurial light and when it hits the ground --

It is the pilot.

Trinity helps Neo up.

NEO
Thanks.

TRINITY
You're hit --

NEO
I'm fine.

Neo is already looking at the helicopter.

NEO
Can you fly that thing?

TRINITY
Not yet.

She pulls out a cellular phone.


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

Tank is back at the controls.

TANK
Operator.

TRINITY (V.O.)
Tank, I need a pilot program for a
military M-109 helicopter.

Tank is immediately searching the disk drawers.

TRINITY (V.O.)
Hurry!

His fingers flash over the gleaming laser disks, finding
one that he feeds into Trinityls supplement drive,
punching the "load" cormands on her keyboard.


EXT.  ROOF (MATRIX) - DAY

Trinity's eyes flutter as information surges into her
brain, all the essentials of flying a helicopter absorbed
at light-speed.

TRINITY
Let's go.


INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

Marines, trying to communicate with the men on the roof,
are beginning to panic when Agent Jones comes around the
corner.

SERGEANT
Sir!  Sir!  There was gunfire --
we've lost communication with the
roof!

AGENT JONES
Remain at your posts.

SERGEANT
But, sir -- the fire -- we should
evacuate!

AGENT JONES
You will do as you are ordered!

SERGEANT
Yes, sir.

Agent Jones marches into the Presidential Suite.


INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

Agent Jones throws open the bedroom door and enters,
walking through the puddles pooling in the carpet.

Over the RUSHING WATER and the ALARMS, Agent Smith hears
a SOUND and understands the seriousness of the attack.

He turns to the wall of windows as the helicopter drops
INTO VIEW --

Neo is in the back bay, aiming the mounted .50 machine
gun.

AGENT SMITH
No.

The GUN jumps and BULLETS EXPLODE through the WINDOW in a
cacophony of CRASHING GLASS --

As the Agents go for their weapons.

But Neo is too close, the .50 CALIBER too fast and
BULLETS are everywhere, perforating the room.

Agent Smith is hit first, his body jack-knifing back,
blood arcing out with a sudden flash of light --

Then Agent Brown, his GUN still FIRING as his body falls.

And finally Agent Jones.

Neo stares at Morpheus, trying to will him into action.

NEO
Get up, Morpheus!  Get up!

Morpheus sits unmoving, his head still down.

Neo grabs the climbing rope just as marines burst into
the adjoining room.

He attaches only one end to his harness when they OPEN
FIRE.

Quickly he swings the GUN, SPRAYING the other room,
WINDOWS SHATTERING, FURNITURE EXPLODING, marines diving
for cover.


INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

Just outside the Presidential Suite, three marines
blister with snow-static.


INT.  PRESIDENTIAL SUITE (MATRIX) - DAY

Morpheus lifts his face into the room's rain.  His eyes,
still white, begin to blink, twitch, then close.

And when he opens them, they are again dark and flashing
with fire.

The Agents knife into the room, FIRING even as Neo's
BULLET TRAILS chase them.

Morpheus strains at his handcuffs.

The Agents and the marines turn the tide, BLASTING LEAD,
RICOCHETING, POCK-MARKING the COPTER.

FIRING wildly, Neo turns to see Morpheus rising, snapping
the handcuffs, starting for the window.

Agent Smith stops and sees Morpheus run past the open
bedroom door.

AGENT SMITH
Nooo!

He FIRES, sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a
perfect line.

For an instant, we see the BULLETS SHRED, PUNCTURING the
WALL, searing through the wet air with jet trails of
chalk.

And as Morpheus starts to dive for the window, a bullet
buries itself in his leg --

Knocking him off balance.

NEO
He won't make it.

Morpheus lunges, out of control --

As Neo spins, every move a whip crack --

Snapping the other rope-end onto a bolted bar.

Morpheus begins to fall when Neo hurls himself into the
wide blue empty space --

Flying for a moment.

The rope snaking out behind him; an umbilical cord
attached to a machine.

As their two bodies, set in motion, rushing at each other
on a seemingly magnetic course until --

They collide.

Almost bouncing free of each other, arms, legs,
scrambling, hands searching in furious desperation,
finding hold and clinging.

Until the line ends, snapping taut, cracking their
fragile embrace.  Morpheus tumbles, legs flipping over,
falling down --

The ground deliriously distant --

As Neo snatches hold of his mentor's still handcuffed
wrist.

NEO
Gotcha!

Trinity is already pulling the copter up and away.

As Agent Smith grabs the M-16 from the nearest marine.

He'll bring them all down.  Targeting the helicopter, he
aims at something only he can see: the oil line.

PONK.  PONK.  PONK.  The rear HULL is PUNCHED full of
holes and smoke and oil pours out like black blood.

TRINITY
Shit-shit-no!

Neo is pulling Morpheus up to him when he hears the
HELICOPTER BEGIN TO DIE.

NEO
Oh fuck.

Trinity throws the helicopter towards the roof of the
nearest building.

Morpheus and Neo cling to one another as they and the
machine above them begin to fall.

The ENGINE GRINDS, the CHOPPING BLADES start to slow
while --

The Agents stand in the open shattered window, watching
the helicopter disappear behind taller buildings.

Carried by its nomentum, Trinity guides the parabolic
fall over the nearest roof where --

Neo and Morpheus drop safely, rolling free as the rope
goes slack.  Neo gets to his feet, trying to detach
himself but --

The helicopter is falling too fast, arcing over the roof
like a setting sun --

The coils of slack snap taught --

Yanking Neo off his feet, dragging him with ferocious
speed towards the edge even as --

Trinity lunges for the back door, her gun in one hand,
grabbing for the rope with the other --

Neo flies like a skipping stone, hurtling straight AT us,
when his feet hit the rain gutter --

A fulcrum that levers him up just as --

Trinity FIRES, severing the cord from the HELICOPTER,
falling free of it as it SMASHES, blades first into a
glass skyscraper.

Holding onto the rope she swings, connected to Neo, who
stands on the building's edge watching her arc beneath
him as the HELICOPTER EXPLODES --

She bounces against a shatterproof window that spider-
cracks out while FLAMES ERUPT behind her.


INT.  MAIN DECK

Tank stares at the screen, his mouth agape.

TANK
He's the One.  He's got to be...


EXT.  ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY

Neo pulls Trinity up into his arms.  Both shaking, they
hold each other again.

MORPHEUS
I knew it!  I goddamn knew it!

TRINITY
Morpheus!

She runs at him, throwing her arms around him.

MORPHEUS
Do you believe me now?  He's the
One!  Who else could have done
this?

NEO
Morpheus, I know you won't believe
me but the Oracle told ne I'm not
the One.

MORPHEUS
It doesn't matter if I don't
believe you --

His eyes light up.

MORPHEUS
What matters is that you don't
believe her.


INT.  MAIN DECK

The PHONE RINGS.

TRINITY (V.O.)
Tank, get us out of here.

TANK
Got one ready.  An underground El
station.  State and Balbo.

TRINITY (V.O.)
See ya soon.

LINE GOES DEAD.  Tank looks at the bodies and smiles.

TANK
See ya soon.


EXT.  ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY

The rope is all that remains.  Agent Smith can barely
control his anger.

AGENT BROWN
The trace was completed.

AGENT JONES
We have their position.

AGENT BROWN
The extermination unit is in
place.

AGENT JONES
Order the strike.

Agent Smith can't stand listening to them.  He moves to
the edge of the building, looking out at the surrounding
city.

AGENT SMITH
They're not out yet.


INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

A metal gate is locked, the sign reading, "Station
Closed."  Neo looks around, takes out a GUN and BLOWS OFF
the LOCK.

In the moist underground distance they hear the MUTED
RING of a TELEPHONE.

The PHONE is RINGING inside a graffiti-covered booth.

Across from it, sitting hunched against the red concrete
wall, is an OLD MAN.  He stares at the RINGING PHONE,
taking a final pull off his T-bird.  No one is around.
It continues to RING.

Determined, he stands and walks to the booth.  He is
about to answer the phone, when Neo sees him.

NEO
Don't!

The Old Man stops, Neo rushes at hin, gliding smoothly
over the turnstiles.

OLD MAN
I'm sorry -- I didn't mean!

The Old Man is shaking, terrified.  Neo looks at his gun.
He glances over his shoulder, then eases back the hammer.

NEO
Get outta here.  Okay?  Run!  Go!

The Old Man nods, turns and hurries deeper into the urban
cave, disappearing into the shadows as Trinity and
Morpheus arrive.

TRINITY
What happened?  Was that --

NEO
It was nobody.

Neo turns to the RINGING BOOTH.

NEO
Let's go!  You first, Morpheus.

Morpheus gets in and answers the phone.

Lost in the shadow, the Old Man turns back and watches as
Morpheus disappears, the phone dropping, dangling by its
cord.

His eyes grow wide, glowing white in the dark.


EXT.  ROOFTOP (MATRIX) - DAY

Agent Smith stares, his face twisted with hate.  He will
never be free of the Matrix.

He starts to turn from the edge of the building when he
suddenly hears it, his head whipping back around,
staring --


INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

As the Old Man stares.

Trinity hangs up the phone.  She turns to Neo, standing
close enough to kiss him.

TRINITY
Morpheus is right, you know.  It
doesn't matter what he believes or
even what the Oracle believes.
What matters is what you believe.

NEO
I believe...

He stares at the fullness of her lips.

NEO
I want to kiss you.

She smiles.

TRINITY
I want to kiss you too...

The PHONE begins to RING.

TRINITY
But I want it to be real.

She pulls herself away and gets into the booth when
something catches Neo's eye and he looks to where the Old
Man had been.

She hears him SCREAM and sees Agent Smith emerge as if
formed by congealing darkness, charging with a fistful of
metal.

The GUN FIRES, the BULLET flying at her, BURSTING through
the plastic WINDOW just as --

Trinity disappears.

The handset hanging in the air as the BULLET HITS,
SHATTERING the EAR-PIECE.


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

Trinity blinks, shivering as her conscious exits the
Construct.

TRINITY
Neo!

TANK
What the hell just happened?

TRINITY
An Agent!  You have to send me
back!

TANK
I can't!


INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

GUN REPORT THUNDERS through the underground, both men
BLASTING, moving at impossible speed.

For a blinking noment we enter BULLET-TIME.

Gun flash tongues curl from Neols gun, bullets float
forward like a plane noving across the sky, cartridges
cartwheel into space.

An instant later they are nearly on top of each other,
rolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored
reflection of the other --

Each jamming their gun tight to the other's head.

They freeze in a kind of embrace; Neo sweating, panting,
Agent Smith machine-calm.

Agent Smith smiles.

AGENT SMITH
You're empty.

Neo pulls the TRIGGER.  CLICK.

NEO
So are you.

The smile falls.  Agent Smith yanks his TRIGGER.

CLICK.

Agent Smith's face warps with rage and he attacks, fist
flying at furious speed, blows and counters, Neo
retreating as --

A knife-hand opens his forearm, and a kick sends him
slamming back against a steel column.

Stunned, he ducks just under a punch that crunches into
the beam, STEEL CHUNKS EXPLODING like shrapnel.

Behind him, Neo leaps into the air, delivering a neck-
snapping reverse round-house.  Agent Smith's glasses fly
off and he glares at Neo; his eyes, ice blue.

AGENT SMITH
You can't win.

NEO
I already have.

He attacks with a vicious series of blows but the Agent
seems to absorb them, waiting for his opening.

And this time Agent Smith's attack is too much, an
unrelenting fury, fists pounding like jackhammers.


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

Trinity watches Neo as his body jerks, mouth coughing
blood, his life signs going wild.

TRINITY
Jesus, he's killing him!


INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

Agent Smith grabs hold of him, lifting him into the air,
hurling him against the curved wall of the train tunnel,
where he falls inches from the electrified third-rail.

The Agent is about to jump down, and press his attack
when he hears sonething.  From deep in the tunnel, like
an animal cry; a burst of high-speed METAL GRINDING
against METAL.

The sound of an ON-COMING TRAIN.


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

Tank is trying to find another entrance.

TRINITY
Send me back, Tank!  Anywhere!

TANK
I'm looking, Trinity!  I'm
looking!

From the cockpit, an ALARM sounds.  Morpheus hurries to
the front console, typing, bringing up the radar.

Trinity follows him.

TRINITY
What is it... oh no.

In every pipe surrounding them, they see the
Extermination Unit.

TRINITY
Sentinels.


INT.  SEWER MAIN

The killing machine we saw in the History Program blister
by us like tracer bullets shot down the throat of the
abyss.


INT.  "EL" STATION (MATRIX) - DAY

Neo tries to get up.  Agent Smith jumps down onto the
tracks and drop-kicks him in the face.

The world begins to shake, RUMBLING as the TRAIN NEARS.

AGENT SMITH
Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson?

Agent Smith grabs Neo in a choke-hold, forcing him to
look down the tracks, the train's headlight burning a
hole in the darkness.

AGENT SMITH
That is the sound of
inevitability.

Neo sees it coming and he starts to fight.

AGENT SMITH
It is the sound of your death.

There is another METAL SCREECH, MUCH LOUDER, closer, as
Agent Smith tightens his hold.  Neo is unable to breathe.

AGENT SMITH
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

The TRAIN ROARS at them, swallowing Agent Smith's words.

The veins bulge in Neo's head, as he grits through the
pain.

He is not ready to die.

NEO
My name is Neo.

Impossibly, he hurls himself straight up, smashing Smith
against the concrete ceiling of the tunnel.

They fall as the sound and fury of the TRAIN EXPLODES
INTO the station.

Neo back-flips up off the tracks just as --

The train barrels over Agent Smith.

Neo stands, knees shaking, when the train slams on its
emergency brake.  With an ear-splitting SHRIEK of
TORTURED RAILS, the train slows, part of it still in the
station.

Neo turns, limping, starting to run, racing for the
escalator --

As the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last
car open; Agent Smith bursts out in furious pursuit, his
glasses again intact.


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

Morpheus checks the ship's self destruct key.

TRINITY
You can't use that until Neo is
out!

MORPHEUS
I know.  Don't worry, he'll make
it.


EXT.  CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

A man sits in his Mercedes, talking on his car phone when
his door is thrown open.  Neo yanks him out and jumps in.

Further down the street, Agent Smith slows, calmly
touching his ear-piece.

Neo throws the car across traffic, rocketing down a side-
street.


INT.  CAR (MATRIX) - DAY

Driving like a demon with one hand, he grabs the car
phone and dials long distance.

INT.  HOVERCRAFT

Tank answers.

TANK
Operator.

NEO (V.O.)
Mr. Wizard, Get me the fuck out
of here!


INT.  CAR (MATRIX) - DAY

Looking over his shoulder, watching the mirrors, Neo
drives almost unconsciously.

NEO
Hurry, Tank!  I got some serious
pursuit!


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

The keyboard clicking, Tank searches for an exit.
Trinity screams into the headset.

TRINITY
Neo, you better get your ass back
here!


INT.  CAR

NEO
I'm trying, Trinity.  I'm trying.

TANK (V.O.)
I got one!

Neo glances to his right and sees Agent Brown, now
driving the car beside his.  Agent Brown swerves,
slamming into him.

TANK (V.O.)
Wabash and Lake.  A hotel.

Neo fights the steering wheel as Agent Brown pushes the
car up over the median.

TANK (V.O.)
Room 303.

Neo drops the phone as his car bucks into the opposing
lane --

Directly into the charging path of an enormous truck
driven by Agent Smith.

Neo dives from the Mercedes as the truck plows into it,
rending metal and GLASS, crushing through, totaling other
cars, as it EXPLODES.

Neo is up and running even as orange and black clouds
billow up behind hin.


EXT.  CITY STREET (MATRIX) - DAY

Three figures silhouette by the burning wreckage become
the three agents.

Further down the street, Neo hauls his broken, bleeding
ass.

Agents Brown and Smith slow, touching their ear-pieces as
Agent Jones continues chasing full-bore.

Neo spins around a corner, racing toward a hotel called:
the Heart of Chicago Hotel.

Only Agent Jones is behind him now.

Neo dives into the alley.  At the far end he sees Agent
Brown charging.  Neo leaps for the fire escape and begins
to climb.


INT.  SEWER MAIN

Sentinels open and shift like killer kaleidoscopes as
they ready their weapons, swarming around the
Nebuchadnezzar.


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

The hovercraft booms as machines drop onto it.

TANK
I'm going to make the call.

MORPHEUS
Do it!


INT.  "HEART OF CHICAGO" HOTEL (MATRIX) - DAY

Agent Snith is in the elevator when he hears the DISTANT
RING of a PHONE.


EXT.  ALLEY (MATRIX) - DAY

The agents chase him, FIRING, BULLETS SPARKING and
RICOCHETING even as Neo jumps for the third-floor
platform.

Neo kicks in the window, jumping into the hall.  The
doors count backwards:  310...  309...


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

Morpheus grabs the biggest gun he can find.  The lasers
begin to slice through the hull.

TRINITY
Where is he?

TANK
Almost there.

MORPHEUS
He's going to make it.

TRINITY
Hurry, Neo.


INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

Neo can hear the PHONE RINGING.

305...  304...

Agent Brown reaches the broken window behind him just as
Neo grabs the handle of 303, throwing open the door to
find --

Agent Sniith, waiting, .45 cocked.

Neo can't move -- can't think --

BOOM.


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

Neo's body jerks, and everyone hears it as the life
monitors snap flat-line.

Trinity screams.  Morpheus is frozen in disbelief.


INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

Three holes in his chest, Neo falls to the blue shag
carpeting, blood smearing down the wallpaper.

Agent Smith stands over him, still aiming, taking no
chances.

AGENT SMITH
Check him.


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

Through the lasered opening, Morpheus screams, blasting
away at the machines; comet-wads of plasma burning holes
in their armored housings.

Trinity collapses onto Neo's body.

TRINITY
No-no-no!  Neo, you're not dead!
You can't be dead!


INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

Kneeling beside him, Agent Brown checks his vital signs.

AGENT BROWN
He's gone.

Agent Smith smiles, standing over him.

AGENT SMITH
I told you, you couldn't win.


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

Tank is hit, a laser bolt knocking him to the ground.
They can't hold them off any longer.  Morpheus lunges for
the self destruct --

As Trinity whispers in Neo's ear.

TRINITY
You're right here.  I'm holding
you, Neo.  I'm not letting you go.
Do you hear me?  I won't let you
go.


INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

The agents walk to the elevator, leaving Neo's body
behind.


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

Morpheus flicks the Plexiglas shield of the self-
destruct.

TRINITY
Goddamnit, Neo!  Don't give it up!
Not now!

She pounds on his chest.

TRINITY
Not now!


INT.  HOTEL HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

The BLOW ECHOES deep in his mind.

His eyes snap open.


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

Trinity screams as the monitors jump back to life.  Tank
and Morpheus stare, unbelieving.

It is a miracle.

TRINITY
Now get up!


INT.  HALL (MATRIX) - DAY

Neo struggles, holding his chest, sitting up.  Down the
hall, he sees the elevator closing and --

Agent Smith staring at him as if he were looking at a
Cypher.

Neo gives him the finger.

AGENT SMITH
Nooooo!

Agent Smith pounds on the elevator door.


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

A sentinel BLOWS a hole in Morpheus' right arm and he
screams, refusing to let go of the detonator.

INT.  ROOM 303 (MATRIX) - DAY

Neo dives for the RINGING PHONE.


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

Machines split open the craft, pouring in, lasers
targeting everywhere.

A beat finds the center of Morpheus' forehead and he
screams, ready to die.

TRINITY
Now!

He turns the key.


INT.  OVERFLOW PIT

A blinding shock of white lights flood the chamber;
sentinels blink and fall instantly dead, filling the pit
with their cold, metal carcasses.


INT.  HOVERCRAFT

In the still darkness, only the humans are alive.

TRINITY
Neo?

His eyes open.  Tears pour from her smiling eyes as he
reaches up to touch her.

And she kisses hin; it seems like it might last forever.

FADE TO BLACK.


FADE IN:

ON COMPUTER SCREEN

as in the opening.  The cursor beating steadily, waiting.

A PHONE begins to RING.

It is answered and the screen fills instantly with the
trace program.  After a long beat, we recognize Neo's
voice.

NEO (V.O.)
Hi.  It's me.  I know you're out
there.  I know you're working as
fast as you can to catch me.

We CLOSE IN ON the racing columns of numbers shimmering
across the screen.

NEO (V.O.)
I thought I should call and let
you know how things stand.

We DIVE THROUGH the numbers, surging UP THROUGH the
darkness, sucked TOWARDS a tight constellation of stars.

NEO (V.O.)
I know you're real proud of this
world you've built, the way it
works, all the nice little rules
and such, but I've got some bad
news.

We realize that the constellation is actually the holes
in the mouthpiece of a phone.  Seen from inside.

NEO (V.O.)
I've decided to make a few
changes.

We SHOOT THROUGH the holes as Neo hangs up the phone.

He steps out of the phone booth and starts walking,
wearing a long black coat and dark glasses.  He passes a
mother dragging her little BOY, who cranes his neck as --

Neo takes off, flying up into the air.

BOY
Mommy!  Mommy!

MOMMY
What?

BOY
That man!  That man flies!

MOMMY
Don't be silly, honey.  Men don't
fly.

There is a RUSH of AIR as the Boy stares up as Neo shoots
overhead.  His coat billowing like a black leather cape
as he soars up, up, and away.

FADE OUT.

15   OVER BLACKNESS, we HEAR a BACH HARPSICHORD CONCERTO. And then a 15
WOMAN -- breathing hard -- straining, harder and harder -- until
finally we HEAR a NEWBORN BABY CRYING -- and we...

FADE IN:

EXT. VULCAN FAMILY HOME - DUSK

The image is spectacular, aglow in DUSK LIGHT: a beautiful BABY,
just born, held in a WOMAN'S HANDS. It is being cleaned; warm
water runs down its face and body.

TIGHT ON the MIDWIFE (female, 60's) who holds and cleans the
baby as it CRIES. Another, younger, Midwife can be seen behind
her, assisting with the pitchers of water. As she cleans the
baby, she says to someone OFF-CAMERA:

MIDWIFE
He is strong.

The baby, now calm, gets SWADDLED.    He is then gently held out
to the new MOTHER:

AMANDA GRAYSON, late 20's. An original beauty. She lies on a
divan, spent but eager to hold her first child. She tenderly
takes the infant into her arms, tears in her eyes, mesmerized.
She holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly:

AMANDA
... hello.

CLOSE ON the YOUNGER MIDWIFE, standing at the rear of the room.
She raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks:

YOUNGER MIDWIFE
The baby is healthy. Why does she cry?

MIDWIFE
(a beat; then)
She is human.

A distant, quiet BUZZ -- and the elder Midwife stands, looking
into the distance. And this is when we see, for the first time,
that the Midwife has POINTED EARS.

MIDWIFE (CONT'D)
Sarek arrives.

The Midwife moves away -- we PUSH IN on Amanda, who looks up for
a moment, clearly disquieted.




15A   OMIT                                                              15A

15B   EXT. VULCAN LANDSCAPE - DUSK  FORMER SC. 14                       15B

A planet of massive, tortured ROCK FORMS, distant cities
constructed atop and underneath them. A HOVER-SPEEDER in the
mid-ground kicks up dust, backlit by the sun, as it traces the
horizon. We PAN WITH IT, revealing a FAMILY HOME, built
seamlessly into a rocky mountainside.

A SUPER READS: STARDATE 2230.06.

The speeder parks outside the home --

15C   EXT. VULCAN HOME - DUSK                                           15C

SAREK (late 40's, a Vulcan) comes out to the balcony through the
rear doors of the home. He moves to Amanda and kneels. He
looks at the child -- his child -- and says:

SAREK
Well done.

She looks at him for a beat, then says, flatly -- with just
enough rancor:

AMANDA
Thanks.

He regards her.   Knows he's in TROUBLE --

SAREK
Your tone suggests disappointment. The
Science Council required my presence for
a session regarding--

AMANDA
Don't do that.     You knew I wanted you
here.

The Vulcan Midwives share a look. Sarek glances at them. Nods.
The two women excuse themselves. Sarek reaches over, touches a
small touchpad -- the HARPSICHORD MUSIC STOPS. He says,
clinically:

SAREK
As you are aware, the Vulcan male is
traditionally not present at the moment
of delivery.

AMANDA
Well traditionally, I'm not the one
giving birth.
(then)
(MORE)

15C   CONTINUED:                                                        15C
AMANDA (CONT'D)
I moved here -- to another planet -- to
be with you. I needed you to be with me
today. Holding my hand and telling me
I'm doing great, even when I'm just...
breathing the best I can.

Sad that she has to tell him this at all, she just looks back at
the baby -- finding comfort in his innocence. Sarek considers
this. He moves closer to her. Whispers intimately:

SAREK
You are correct. I should have been
here. I am sorry.

And with her free hand, she pulls Sarek closer -- and kisses
him. And the two look at the baby.

SAREK (CONT'D)
I had a thought. That we might name the
child after one of our respected early
society-builders. His name was "Spock".

She looks at the baby, not immediately taken by the name.

SAREK (CONT'D)
Your silence does not suggest enormous
enthusiasm.

AMANDA
No... Spock.
(smiles, touches his
face)
... Spock.

She looks at Sarek: Spock it is.

SAREK
The child has your eyes.

She pulls back the baby's swaddling, revealing his ears.    She
gently rubs the top of his right ear -- AND IT UNFURLS,
revealing a small, soft pointed VULCAN EAR.

AMANDA
... and your ears.

And off the image of this TINY BABY, half-human, half-Vulcan,
we... FADE OUT. And over BLACKNESS, we BEGIN TO HEAR an ALARM
SOUNDING -- GROWING -- and the SUPER "THREE YEARS LATER" APPEARS
-- and finally the BLACKNESS IS SPLIT BY TURBO-LIFT DOORS
OPENING and we REVEAL THAT WE'RE ON:

15D   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN  FORMER SC. 15A                                15D

With URGENCY, we MOVE DOWN a corridor with CAPTAIN ROBAU and
OFFICER PITTS:


CAPTAIN ROBAU                      OFFICER PITTS
-- our sensors haven't made        -- no sir, it looked like a
sense of the anomaly?              lightning storm in the middle
-- how far are we from the         of space --
Klingon Neutral Zone?              -- 150,000 kilometers, but the
vessel is not Klingon, Sir,
its registry doesn't match any
recorded profile --

SHWISH! The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP -- a
flurry of activity -- the MASSIVE SHIP they are approaching on
the VIEWSCREEN. Robau moves to the center -- then he asks:

CAPTAIN ROBAU
Report.

-- turning to the ship's FIRST OFFICER: 32, all-American face,
swiveling in a console chair to FACE US:

FIRST OFFICER
Sir, new contact bearing zero-three-four.

CAPTAIN ROBAU                      FIRST OFFICER
Are they transmitting on any       Negative, Captain -- all
frequency?                         communications appear to be
shut down.

CAPTAIN ROBAU                      FIRST OFFICER
Hail the ship. What's the          Nothing even close, Sir.
closest match on registry?

Robau moves to Pitts:

CAPTAIN ROBAU
Any response?

OFFICER PITTS
No Sir -- hails met with silence.

CAPTAIN ROBAU
Maybe they're incapable -- any
identifiable damage?

OFFICER PITTS
Negative, Sir -- but our readings seem
confused--

15D   CONTINUED:                                                        15D

CAPTAIN ROBAU
Confused?

OFFICER PITTS
-- not only is the ship unregistered --
but even its construction materials seem
unrecognizable.

Robau sits in the captain's chair his eyes on the ship as they
approach -- and we SEE IT on the VIEWSCREEN -- THE NARADA --
ENORMOUS AND THREATENING. He doesn't even realize that he says:

CAPTAIN ROBAU
... oh my God...
(to himself, boggled)
A lightning storm... then this...
(to deck)
Signal all departments: first contact
protocols. Looks like we have someone
new on the block. All Stop.

16-17 OMIT                                                             16-17

18-19 OMIT                                                             18-19

19C   EXT. DEEP SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                      19C

And in the endless vacuum of space, and in TOTAL SILENCE, the
Kelvin appears as a dot, coming to a stop in front of the
gigantic BLACK CLAW that is the Narada --

19D   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE                                       19D

Crew members are glued to their telemetry, working consoles:

FIRST OFFICER
Sir, should we initiate an invasive scan?

CAPTAIN ROBAU
That could be seen as an act of
provocation -- all readings passive--

Suddenly, a WARNING BEEP --


OFFICER PITTS                     CAPTAIN ROBAU
Sir, I have a reading --
they've locked weapons on us!     -- Red alert!   Arm weapons!

ALARMS BLARE -- LIGHTS GO RED as --

20    EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                          20

The Narada FIRES a TORPEDO -- IT HEADS FOR THE KELVIN -- then
SEPARATES, fracturing into a multi-hit projectile --

21    INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - CONTINUOUS                                  21

Officers SCRAMBLE, brace for impact --


FIRST OFFICER                      CAPTAIN ROBAU
Torpedo locked on us at 320
degrees, mark two -- incoming      -- Evasive pattern Delta-5!
fast!

22    EXT. U.S.S. KELVIN - CONTINUOUS                                  22

A direct hit SMASHES several decks along the DISH of the ship --

23    INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                    23

In the massive Engine Room, a HUGE BLAST -- MEN GO FLYING IN THE
STEEL-SHATTERING EXPLOSION --

24    INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                         24

Captain Robau helps a fallen CREW MEMBER up from the floor --
then, on his chair com.:

CAPTAIN ROBAU
Damage report!

INTERCUT with:

24A   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                    24A

Moving with the Kelvin's CHIEF ENGINEER:

CHIEF ENGINEER
Our shields did nothing, Sir! Never seen
anything like it! Weapons off-line!
Main power at 38 percent!

As the crew regains their footing, the First Officer pulls
himself to his console, true fear in his eyes as he places an
inter-ship call -- it's RINGING -- his fear grows with every
passing RING -- then, we INTERCUT WITH:

24B   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - MEDICAL BAY - CONTINUOUS  FORMER SC. 26B    24B

A WOMAN, 25, answers her communicator -- she lies on an exam
table, afraid -- and pregnant. This is WINONA.

7
24B   CONTINUED:                                                     24B

WINONA
-- what was that-- what's happening?!

But the First Officer is just relieved that she's still alive:

FIRST OFFICER
-- you're okay-- thank God-- where are
you?

WINONA
Medical bay-- I had a few close
contractions-- I'm fine-- what was that?

FIRST OFFICER
Just sit tight-- stay there-- we'll be
fine--

Or maybe not:

OFFICER PITTS
They're firing another, Captain!

25    EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                           25

ANOTHER NARADA TORPEDO -- it SEPARATES, pieces HIT the Kelvin.

25A   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                    25A

Chief Engineer RUNS past us -- CONSUMED BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION!

25B   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                       25B

A FEMALE CREW MEMBER running down the hall suddenly HOLDS ON as
a HOLE IS RIPPED IN THE HALL -- and she's YANKED OUT OF THE
CORRIDOR -- the CAMERA finally getting sucked out too!

26    INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                          26

-- PANDEMONIUM --

26    CONTINUED:                                                         26

HELMSMAN                           OFFICER PITTS

FIRST OFFICER                      TACTICAL OFFICER

Seven! We're dropping here!          take another hit like that!
Six!

CAPTAIN ROBAU
All remaining power to forward shields!
Prepare the shuttles f--

And he STOPS. They all do. A fucking FACE is now on their
VIEWSCREEN. A ROMULAN FACE -- the FIRST OFFICER of the Narada,
whom we'll come to know as AYEL:

AYEL
My commander requests the presence of
your captain in order to negotiate a
cease-fire. You will come aboard our
ship via shuttlecraft. Your refusal
would be unwise.

Screen goes DEAD. All eyes on Robau... and he feels them.      A
tense, horrible moment. Finally, to the First Officer:

CAPTAIN ROBAU
Walk with me.

The First Officer follows Robau OFF THE BRIDGE AND INTO:

26A   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS                        26A

As they walk, briskly:

CAPTAIN ROBAU
If I don't report within fifteen minutes,
execute general order 13.

FIRST OFFICER
Sir, we could issue a mayday call to--

CAPTAIN ROBAU
(frightened, but firm)
There is no help for us out here. If
we're going down, we're taking them with
us -- you save as many as you can.

8A
26A   CONTINUED:                                                       26A

FIRST OFFICER
... aye, Captain.

Robau heads into a waiting TURBOLIFT, turns -- they lock eyes,
knowing what this means. Finally:

CAPTAIN ROBAU
You're Captain now. Mr. Kirk.

He's gone.   And we realize this is GEORGE KIRK, Jim's father.

26B-C OMIT                                                         26B-C

26D   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                        26D

All eyes on Kirk as he enters -- moves to the captain's chair.
Sits. Not a small moment. Speaking his first words as Captain:

GEORGE KIRK
Lieutenant Pitts. Transfer Robau's vital
signs to the main view screen.

OFFICER PITTS
Yessir.

In a moment, Robau's VITAL SIGNS appear on various monitors --
his HEART RATE, OXYGEN LEVELS, BLOOD PRESSURE, all of it. A LOW-
PITCHED BEEPBEEP of his HEARTBEAT is now HEARD --

SCIENCE OFFICER
Vitals on line.

GEORGE KIRK
(slightly awkward)
-- thank you.

26DA INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                    26DA

TILT DOWN as the TURBO-LIFT DESCENDS -- we PUSH IN as the doors
open and Captain Robau gets out -- moves quickly -- hurries down
a SHUTTLE BAY catwalk --

26DB INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS  FORMER SC. 26C                        26DB

Robau enters a shuttle -- LIGHTS BLINK to life.   He moves to the
cockpit -- starts the vehicle up --

CAPTAIN ROBAU
Computer, initiate departure sequence.

A LOUD HISS and the craft SHUDDERS as it disembarks --

26DC INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                         26DC

Sparks dripping from the ceiling, everyone is motionless -- eyes
on the monitors -- and we're TIGHT ON GEORGE KIRK -- the BEEPS
of Robau's heart might as well be representing his own. He
realizes he's sweating -- wipes his forehead as:

OFFICER PITTS
The shuttle's pulling out of main bay,
Sir.

GEORGE KIRK
I want to see him -- floodlights please.

10


26E   EXT. U.S.S. KELVIN - SPACE                                     26E

Two MASSIVE FLOODLIGHTS on the Kelvin's dish GO HOT -- and turn,
FLARING out the lens -- landing on the SHUTTLE as it leaves the
KELVIN, heading toward the imposing Narada.

26EA INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                       26EA

Backlit by the distant floodlights, Robau remains steely-eyed as
he moves for the darkened ship -- nerves --

26F   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE                                    26F

And Robau's HEARTBEAT QUICKENS -- the tension they all feel:

OFFICER PITTS
His heart rate's elevated--

HELMSMAN
He's scared.

GEORGE KIRK
He's brave.    That's what he is.

26FA INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                       26FA

Robau watches as he gets closer, the BEEPBEEPING HEARD over the
SOUNDS of the shuttle -- but then --

26FB EXT. NARADA - SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                26FB

ALL WE HEAR IS THE LOW-PITCHED BEEPBEEP as the small shuttle
seems to get swallowed up by the massive forward-facing spires
of the Narada -- the distant floodlights creating EERIE SHADOWS
everywhere. A gigantic IRIS DOOR TURNS, SLOWLY OPENS -- and the
shuttle enters the Narada's main HANGAR -- the door CLOSES --

26FC INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                        26FC

And everyone is just motionless and silent. Only Robau's VITAL
SIGNS can be HEARD, BEEPING away. George's eyes glued ahead --

26G   INT. SHUTTLE NARADA HANGAR - CONTINUOUS                        26G

TIGHT ON ROBAU as he faces the shuttle door, considering his
fate. Finally the SHUTTLE DOOR OPENS -- standing there are
eight ROMULAN GUARDS, brandishing WEAPONS. He steps down. They
grab him, hard -- he's SCANNED -- FRISKED -- PULLED ALONG -- and
we REVEAL the absolutely MASSIVE HANGAR, the insane architecture
of the interior of this dark, wet, dripping ship --

11


26H   INT. NARADA BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                                     26H

Robau is led into the enormous, dark bridge. A dozen Romulans
at controls. Robau does his level best to portray confidence as
he is led up a walkway to AYEL. Behind him, sitting silhouetted
and motionless, turned away and looking off, is his captain. A
presence always felt in this scene. This is NERO.

Ayel touches a panel, then THROWS AN IMAGE into the air before
Robau. A ROTATING HOLOGRAM OF A UNIQUE-LOOKING SPACECRAFT (we
will refer to it as the JELLYFISH).

AYEL
Are you familiar with this craft?

Robau regards it.   Then:

CAPTAIN ROBAU
Who is your commander?
(silence, then re: Nero)
Is it him?

AYEL
You will speak only to me.

CAPTAIN ROBAU
Then ask your commander what right he has
to attack a Federation vessel.

AYEL
That was hardly an attack. My commander
will easily destroy your ship. If you do
not respond to the question.

Robau considers the hologram again.     And what his answer might
mean for the fate of his crew.

CAPTAIN ROBAU
I've never seen it. Or any ship like it.

AYEL
Are you familiar with -- or better, know
the location of -- Ambassador Spock?

Ayel has thrown another HOLOGRAM -- A FLOATING, ROTATING IMAGE
OF SPOCK, who appears to be 75 earth-years old. The baby, born
just three years earlier. Robau is as confused as we are...

CAPTAIN ROBAU
I am unfamiliar with Ambassador Spock.

AYEL
A final question. What is the current
stardate?

12
26H   CONTINUED:                                                         26H

CAPTAIN ROBAU
(the fuck?)
... Stardate? ... it's 2233.04.
(finally)
... hey, where are you from--?

Suddenly: TSCHING! Nero's activated his STAFF -- FOUR LARGE,
HORRIFYING BLADES APPEAR AT THE TIP AND NERO SPRINGS TO LIFE,
CHARGING ROBAU WITH A ROAR AND ROBAU'S EYES POP HOLY SHIT AND--

26HA INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE                                         26HA

BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE... Robau's vitals go dead.      PUSH IN ON
KIRK as a SCREAMING ALARM IS HEARD --

OFFICER PITTS                      GEORGE KIRK
They're launching again!           Evasive! Evasive! Delta-Five
maneuver! Fire full-spread!

26J   EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                            26J

The Kelvin BANKS as it FIRES WILDLY -- another TORPEDO BLASTING
FROM THE NARADA -- it SEPARATES -- some miss, OTHERS HIT!

26K   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE                                        26K

Debris FLIES TROUGH THE CEILING, SLAMMING INTO A BRIDGE SUPPORT
BEAM! Green COOLANT SPEWS from under the floor grating --

GEORGE KIRK
I'm initiating General Order 13! Set
self-destruct for maximum matter-
antimatter yield! Two minute countdown!

OFFICER PITTS
Yessir!

GEORGE KIRK
I want auto-pilot targeted for their fuel
cells!

TACTICAL OFFICER
Sir, unable to locate the ship's power
source!

GEORGE KIRK
Then just target the damn thing dead
center!

HELMSMAN
We got bigger problems: the first hit
destroyed auto-pilot!

26K   CONTINUED:                                                         26K
HELMSMAN (CONT'D)
The only way we're gonna ram that ship is
to fly manual control!

TIGHT ON GEORGE as this lands.      More honorable than terrified:

GEORGE KIRK
-- then I'll do it myself -- get to the
shuttles, now!
(no one moves until:)
THAT'S AN ORDER! GO!

Agony in the faces as they reluctantly hurry off -- Kirk takes
the Captain's chair, hits the COMLINK:

GEORGE KIRK (CONT'D)
All decks, this is the Captain speaking --
evacuate the ship immediately, get to
your designated shuttle crafts --

26L   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - MEDICAL BAY - CONTINUOUS                        26L

MOVE FAST around Winona, in fucking labor now -- being
transferred onto a wheelchair by the Doctor and Nurse--

GEORGE KIRK (V.O.)                         WINONA
-- repeat: evacuate ship and
get to designated shuttles           -- that's George's voice --
NOW!                                 what's happening?

NURSE
We're packing it up -- you'll deliver in
the shuttle!

-- and she's on the move, out the door as her COMMUNICATOR
SOUNDS -- she answers --

WINONA
-- George!

26M   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                             26M

Alone now on the bridge, piloting this massive craft by himself -
- George talks to Winona from the Captain's chair --

GEORGE KIRK
I have medical shuttle 37 standing by,
get to it now -- can you do that?

WINONA
Yes -- where are you?

HOLD ON GEORGE for a moment as he hesitates -- his eyes glued to
the screens as he pilots --

14
26M   CONTINUED:                                                     26M

GEORGE KIRK
I'm on my way.

WINONA
Good-- and George, it's coming-- our
baby, it's coming now.

PUSH IN on him, his heart shattering -- having to out-maneuver
incoming torpedoes, piloting the ship to its doom -- still, he
forces optimism:

GEORGE KIRK
I'll see you in a minute, sweetheart.

He disconnects -- another ALARM -- he TURNS the ship, FIRES --

26MA EXT. U.S.S. KELVIN - CONTINUOUS                                 26MA

The Kelvin BANKS AGAIN -- its PHOTONS SLAMMING INTO THE ONCOMING
NARADA TORPEDOES, JUST AVOIDING IMPACT!

26N   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - SHUTTLE BAYS - CONTINUOUS                   26N

CREW MEMBERS scramble to their shuttles as the ship TREMBLES --
and we find WINONA among them, being PUSHED through the madness.

26P   INT. MED-EVAC SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                               26P

The Med-Team ARRIVES with Winona in the wheelchair-- it's CHAOS -
- and for Winona, a huge contraction --

WINONA
-- Agh!   That was-- that was a big one!

-- as they put her into the shuttle bed:

NURSE
Just keep breathing, Honey, you're gonna
be just fine--

WINONA
(through the pain)
-- the baby, too, right?

NURSE
-- the baby too.

26R   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                         26R

As George Kirk pilots, he checks the monitors -- one reads the
COUNTDOWN TO SELF-DESTRUCT (180 SECONDS, 179 SECONDS, 178
SECONDS...) and another reads IMPACT PROXIMITY (36,054 METERS,
36,042, 36018...).

26R   CONTINUED:                                                      26R

Another screen that shows stats of DEPARTING SHUTTLES -- more
leaving as we glance at the screen -- but SHUTTLE 34 REMAINS
DOCKED --

The NARADA is GROWING in the viewscreen -- he hits the comlink:

GEORGE KIRK
Captain to shuttle 37 -- is my wife on
board?

INTERCUT WITH:

26S   OMIT                                                            26S

26T   INT. MED-EVAC SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                              26T

The PILOT is readying the controls --

SHUTTLE PILOT
Yessir, she is--

GEORGE KIRK
I need you to go now, d'you hear me?

SHUTTLE PILOT
We're waiting for you, Sir--

GEORGE KIRK
No-- go, take off, immediately.

SHUTTLE PILOT
... yessir!

Shuttle Pilot works the controls -- and Winona, in the back,
feels the shuttle SHUDDER --

WINONA
Wait! We can't go, my husband isn't here
yet! Please! STOP--!

-- but she's suddenly WINCING as another CONTRACTION hits --

NURSE
You'll need to push now-- are you ready?

26U   EXT. U.S.S. KELVIN - SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS                   26U

Clamps holding the shuttle SLAM BACK, the MED-SHUTTLE DROPS

26W   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                       26W

George hits COMLINK -- a TONE -- then WINONA'S VOICE:

WINONA
The shuttle's leaving-- where are you?

As George EVADES ENEMY FIRE, heading for the massive alien ship:

GEORGE KIRK
My love?   Listen carefully, okay?

INTERCUT WITH:

26X   INT. MED-EVAC SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                             26X

Winona, holding her communicator --

WINONA
-- we're about to have this baby --

GEORGE KIRK
Sweetheart... I'm not going to be able to
be there.

And she just stares -- realizing what's happening -- that he's
been made Captain -- that there was an evacuation -- and somehow
she just KNOWS. Tears come to her eyes --

WINONA
-- no-- no, no-- wait--

GEORGE KIRK                           WINONA
I want you to hear me.
Please.                           Are you still on the ship? No-
-- There's no other way-- my      - no, you need to be here--
love-- you know all I want--      -- George, I can't do this
all I want in the world is to     without you--
be with you--                        (crying now)
-- please -- don't d--!

-- but she's WINCING AGAIN --

DOCTOR
Okay-- you need to push.

-- and she does -- the shuttle BANKS and --

26Y   EXT. U.S.S. KELVIN - CORRIDORS                                 26Y

DOZENS of other shuttles, all heading off in escape --

26Z   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                         26Z

26ZA INT. MED-EVAC SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                26ZA

Winona PUSHING -- giving birth to their baby -- and we're BACK
AND FORTH between a husband and wife that will never see each
other again, MUSIC SWELLING as the Kelvin TURNS HARD, avoiding
TORPEDOES -- the shuttle BANKING as the Doctor and Nurse help
Winona -- and we're ON GEORGE as he HEARS A BABY CRYING -- and
TEARS COME TO HIS EYES -- as he says--

GEORGE KIRK
Hey!   Hey, so what is it?

WINONA'S VOICE
-- it's a boy.

GEORGE KIRK
It's a boy?   Yeah?

And now we see Winona, handed this beautiful little boy.   And
she cries, just looking at him --

GEORGE KIRK (CONT'D)
Tell me... tell me about him-- please--

WINONA
He's-- he's beautiful, he looks like you.

Heartsick, George laughs -- glances at the MONITORS -- SELF-
DESTRUCT COUNTDOWN IS AT T-MINUS 20 SECONDS -- oh God...

WINONA (CONT'D)
George, you should be here --

GEORGE KIRK
I know-- so what should we call him, huh?

WINONA
We could name him after your father.

GEORGE KIRK
Tiberius? Are you kidding me? No,
that's the worst-- we'll name him after
your dad-- let's call him Jim.

WINONA
... Jim.   Jim it is.

Through the VIEWSCREEN -- he's ABOUT TO HIT -- the ship ANGLES
within the enormous Narada blades -- George scared now --

18
26ZA CONTINUED:                                                      26ZA

GEORGE KIRK                             WINONA
Sweetheart? Sweetheart? I
love you. Can you hear me?          -- yes-- yes, I hear you...
-- I love you. I love y--

27-37 OMIT                                                              27-37

38A   INT. MED-EVAC SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                 38A

George's voice goes STATIC -- confusion washes over her face --
suddenly LIT BY A BRIGHT GLOW -- she looks over, with wet
devastated eyes --

-- what she sees is the MASSIVE EXPLOSION -- quickly SUCKED AWAY
in the vacuum of space -- and she's CRYING -- holding her new
baby who just lost a father -- his life altered forever...

39    OMIT                                                                39

40    EXT. STARFIELD - ETERNAL NIGHT                                      40

The shuttle SAILS AWAY with the others... HOLD ON THIS... for a
long beat. Then PAN OVER to see NERO'S SHIP TUMBLING SILENTLY
THROUGH SPACE -- DEBRIS still raining from the explosion --

41    INT. NARADA - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                                   41

MAYHEM: ALARMS and CREW work to stabilize the ship (OVERLAPPING
ROMULAN DIALOG TO BE WRITTEN) -- we arrive at Nero, who, with
small specks of HUMAN BLOOD on his face, just STARES at the
fucking HOLOGRAM OF SPOCK -- he's OBSESSED.

Ayel works a monitor, yelling out something (in Romulan) to one
of their men -- and as a result:

42    EXT. NARADA - CONTINUOUS                                            42

Gargantuan "BLADES" EXTEND from the ship like otherworldly SAILS
-- and the ship begins to STEADY -- but then ANOTHER SHIP
APPEARS -- DECLOAKING FROM NOTHINGNESS: a fucking KLINGON VESSEL
-- then ANOTHER -- AND ANOTHER --

43    INT. NARADA - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                                   43

And we're on Ayel as he witnesses, on his monitor, ships,
popping up ALL AROUND THEM -- which is when they HEAR a VOICE --
speaking KLINGON -- and we SUBTITLE:

19
43   CONTINUED:                                                          43

KLINGON VOICE (P.A.)
Trespassing vessel: you have entered the
jurisdiction of the Klingon Empire.
Power down and prepare to be boarded or
you will be destroyed.

Eyes wide, Ayel turns to Nero, still staring at Spock's image:

AYEL
(SUBTITLED, in Romulan)
Commander Nero -- we're surrounded.

Finally Nero looks up.

AYEL (CONT'D)
(SUBTITLED, in Romulan)
Sir-- what are your orders?

And we PUSH IN ON NERO as our MUSIC BUILDS, then we CUT TO:

44   OMIT                                                                 44

45   INT. VULCAN LEARNING CENTER - DAY                                    45

CLOSE ON a young VULCAN BOY. 11 years old. SPOCK. He's
standing in an abstract space -- IMAGES PROJECTED and HOVERING --
questions -- that he's answering as they appear, then disappear:

COMPUTER VOICE                           SPOCK
What is the square root of
2,396,304?                          -- one-thousand-five-hundered-
forty-eight --
-- Correct. What is the
central assumption of Quantum       -- everything that can happen
Cosmology?                          does happen, in equal and
parallel universes --
-- Correct. Identify the 20th
century earth composers of the
following musical progression:      -- Paul McCartney and John
Lennon.
-- Correct

And we find ANOTHER VULCAN CHILD -- then ANOTHER -- all in these
odd spaces -- until we PULL BACK WIDE to reveal a large Vulcan
LEARNING CENTER -- white "bowls", sunk into the dark ground,
where PROFESSORS walk, hands behind their backs, surveying this
mass "mental martial arts" test.

We're on ANOTHER VULCAN CHILD as she gets an answer wrong -- AND
THE LIGHT OVER HER BOWL GOES OUT. Then ANOTHER CHILD -- who
gets an answer wrong -- and HIS LIGHT GOES OUT. An EXTREMELY
WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT reveals BOWL AFTER BOWL as the LIGHTS GO OUT.

20
45   CONTINUED:                                                         45

Until only one bowl remains. Spock's. He finishes his last
question. Gets it right. PUSH IN ON HIM as the COMPUTER SAYS:

COMPUTER VOICE
Your score is one-hundred percent.
Congratulations. Spock.

Off his face, we CUT TO MOMENTS LATER, as Spock collects his
things. As he does, three young VULCAN BULLIES walk up behind
him. Spock glances at them, then back to his things.

YOUNG SPOCK
I presume you've prepared new insults for
today.

VULCAN BULLY  1
Your mother lies with many men.

Spock just NODS.   Tries to ignore the fact that IT STINGS.

YOUNG SPOCK
I have no such information.

VULCAN BULLY  2
You are neither human, nor Vulcan -- and
therefore, have no place in the universe.

YOUNG SPOCK
(swallowing that too)
This is your thirty-fifth attempt to
elicit an emotional response from me.
Logic dictates you would cease by now.

VULCAN BULLY  1
Look. He has human eyes. They look sad,
don't they?

VULCAN BULLY  2
Perhaps an emotional response requires
physical stimuli.

And Bully  2 PUSHES Spock -- who stumbles back, almost falling
into one of the bowls. He looks up as:

VULCAN BULLY  2 (CONT'D)
He's a traitor, you know. Your father.
For marrying her.

Spock stares -- we see him fighting the urge, but he's unable --
AND HE CHARGES THE BULLY AND TACKLES HIM INTO THE BOWL! They
land inside -- Spock cries, flailing as he punches Bully  2!
The other two stand atop the bowl, stunned -- shocked -- unsure
what the hell to do -- and we CUT TO:

21


46   INT. LEARNING CENTER - CORRIDOR - LATER                             46

TIGHT ON Spock, chastened, sitting glumly on a bench. A massive
VULCAN CITY seen through the window behind him. His parents
ARGUE at a distance down the hall:

AMANDA                                SAREK
-- where I'm from, when
someone hits you, you hit back-
- how is that not logical?         -- Spock had no reasonable
-- They pick on him -- they        expectation of being
tease him -- every day.            physically injured --
-- Which is precisely when
reason must guide his actions
-- I want him to embrace           above all.
Vulcan, you know that... but
he has to be himself-- which
means, occasionally, being         -- His "humanity" is very the
human.                             source of his ostracism.
-- When Vulcans get disgusted
with each other, they never
just walk away, do they?           -- No.
-- Well humans do.

And Amanda walks away, leaving Sarek standing there. He turns --
sees his son down the corridor. Approaches. And we're PUSHING
IN on Spock, studying the fear in his eyes. His father stops in
front of him, looming there, looking down stoically:

YOUNG SPOCK
I did not mean to create conflict between
you and mother.

After a beat, Sarek seems to soften a little.     No anger in his
face. Takes a seat beside his son...

SAREK
In marriage... conflict is...

YOUNG SPOCK
... constant?

SAREK
Natural.
(a beat)
Emotions run deep within our race. In
many ways, more deeply than in humans.
Long ago, they nearly destroyed us...
that is why we followed the teachings of
Surak. Now you must choose.

YOUNG SPOCK
... between you and mother?

2
46   CONTINUED:                                                            46

SAREK
Never, my son. But you may choose the
ethic of logic. Logic offers a serenity
humans seldom experience. The control of
feelings... so that they do not control
you.

YOUNG SPOCK
They called you a traitor.
(then)
You suggest that I should be completely
Vulcan... and yet you married a human...
why?

Sarek is clearly conflicted by this.      But he holds steady:

SAREK
As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to
observe and understand human behavior.
Marrying your mother... was logical.
(Spock seems disquieted)
Spock. You are fully capable of choosing
your own destiny. The question you are
faced with... is which path you will
take. This is something only you can
decide.

47   EXT. IOWA FARMHOUSE - DAY                                             47

BAM -- a door opens: 14 year-old GEORGE KIRK, JR. angrily exits
the house, carrying a duffel. His angrier, redneckier UNCLE
FRANK following. 11 year-old JIM KIRK nervously pursues them:

UNCLE FRANK
Go ahead: go-- run away! You know I
could give a damn!

YOUNG KIRK
-- wait-- no!    Where are you going?

GEORGE JR.
Anywhere but here, far as I can get!

UNCLE FRANK
Which won't be far enough -- know what
your problem is?!
(big luggie spit)
No one ever taught you respect! How to
follow orders! Do as you're told!
(to Jim)
-- what the hell are you doing?

YOUNG KIRK
I-- I just don't want my brother to go.

23
47    CONTINUED:                                                      47

UNCLE FRANK
Well I do-- and I asked you to wash the
car! How many damn times do I need to
repeat myself?! How many damn times?
How many?

A glare to George and Frank walks off. Jim nervously follows
his brother, pulling out a small, FLOATING DISC --

YOUNG KIRK
Please stay-- you can have my Flo-Yo!

George hits it away:

GEORGE JR.
This isn't about toys, it's Uncle Frank.
I can't take him anymore -- Mom has no
idea what he's like when she's not here--
d'you hear him talking like he's our
dad?! And that's not even his car you're
washing! That was Dad's car! You know
why you're washing it? Because he's
gonna sell it!

JIM
Don't leave -- okay? We can tell Mom
when she gets back from Africa.

GEORGE JR.
She's gone for five more months, by then
I'll be in a different system.
(sees fear in Kirk)
You're gonna be okay. You always are.
Always doing everything right -- good
grades and obeying every stupid order...
(then)
I can't be a Kirk in this house. Show me
how to do that and I'll stay.

But Jim can offer nothing. George gives him a quick hug and
walks off. Jim sadly watches his brother go.

47A   EXT. IOWA FARMHOUSE - DAY                                       47A

Kirk washes a VINTAGE CORVETTE. Red, white top. Dumping the
sponge in bucket, he's sadly cleaning, his mind spinning over
his brother's departure. Devastated.

And he's wiping the soapy passenger window (SQEEEEEEAK!) with
the sponge, when he STOPS -- seeing the KEYS in the ignition.
PUSH IN ON HIS FACE as a devilish idea comes to his mind. PRE-
LAP A LOUD SCREECH and we CUT TO:

48-49 OMIT                                                          48-49

50    EXT. IOWA FARMHOUSE - DAY - LATER                                 50

THE CORVETTE BLASTS ONTO SCREEN, FISHTAILING ONTO THE ROAD,
young Jim Kirk behind the wheel (NOTE: The SOUND of the engine
is a metallic WHIR -- not a gas engine). TIGHT ON JIM'S FACE as
he drives -- having never done this before, he's as nervous as
he is determined --

50A   EXT. IOWA ROAD - DAY - LATER                                     50A

The CORVETTE SPEEDS -- while inside the car, Jim turns on the
updated, modified RADIO -- scans stations, momentarily losing
control of the car -- but he's back on track as he finds a HARD
ROCK SONG -- and HE'S STARTING TO FUCKING LOVE IT -- PILOTING
SOMETHING THIS FAST FEELS GOOD.

He reaches for a CONVERTIBLE ROOF latch -- then the other -- but
with the speed he's driving, THE ROOF RIPS RIGHT OFF THE FUCKING
CAR -- Jim glances back, wide-eyed -- and the roof TUMBLES
through the air, landing on the road -- and we PUSH AND ARC
AROUND, as a POLICE OFFICER runs out from taking a roadside PISS
-- he races back, jumps on his HOVERCRUISER and TAKES OFF --
SPEEDING AFTER HIM, SIREN BLARING!

BACK IN THE CORVETTE -- BLOOPBLOOP!!! -- Jim's eyes dart to the
REARVIEW as the cruiser WEAVES behind him -- then PULLS UP
BESIDE HIM -- the COP sees a CHILD driving and is AMAZED -- he
calls through his PA:

COP
Son, you pull over that car!

But Jim just BLASTS the RADIO LOUDER:

JIM
I CAN'T HEAR YOU!

51    EXT. IOWA ROAD - CONTINUOUS                                       51

George, bag over shoulder, thumb out. He turns at the SOUND of
the SIREN -- sees what's approaching... that car... looks...
familiar... and the THE CORVETTE SHOOTS PAST HIM, JIM AT THE
WHEEL -- then the POLICE HOVERCRUISER! George runs into the
middle of the road, mouth agape --

GEORGE JR.
-- no... way.

Back at the Corvette, Jim YANKS the steering wheel TOWARD THE
COP -- who RISES to avoid the Corvette, which SCREECHES onto a
perpendicular DIRT ROAD, kicking up wild dust as the Cop ARCS
QUICKLY to follow --

25
51   CONTINUED:                                                       51

Jim is now officially LOVING THIS -- and he DRIVES THROUGH a
FENCE -- CRASH! The Cop RACES through it, in the Corvette's
DUST -- and we PUSH IN on a SIGN that reads "DANGER - QUARRY
AHEAD -- IOWA MINING CO." In fact --

52   EXT. QUARRY - CONTINUOUS                                          52

We see the MASSIVE QUARRY -- hundreds of feet deep -- and TILT
UP to the Corvette and Cop speeding toward it --

53   INT. CORVETTE - MOVING - CONTINUOUS                               53

KIRK, EYES INTENSE, ALMOST SUICIDAL -- this is where he's been
headed all along -- and for a moment we think holy shit -- this
is how James Kirk dies. He speeds toward the edge -- CLOSER --
CLOSER -- but at the last second, Kirk SLAMS the brake -- the
car SKIDS -- PIVOTS -- and he LEAPS FROM THE CAR, WHICH SAILS
SIDEWAYS OFF THE CLIFF EDGE -- FALLING... falling... the COP
comes to QUICK a STOP in CLOUDS of DUST as the Corvette EXPLODES
ON THE QUARRY FLOOR --

The angry Cop hops off his hovercruiser, hand on weapon, as Jim
Kirk, out of breath, exhilarated, gets to his knees.

COP
What's your name, son?

And as he stands, we PUSH IN on him -- LOW and WIDE -- damn if
that kid doesn't have a swagger. It's like the first time he's
ever stood in his life.

JIM
My name's Kirk. James Tiberius Kirk.

And as our MUSIC BUILDS we CUT TO:

54   EXT. RURA PENTHE- MINING QUARRY - NIGHT  FORMER OMIT              54

CONSTANT SHOCKS OF LIGHT as an ALIEN PRISONER -- intelligent, bi-
pedal, but with FOUR TERRIFIED EYES -- is SLAMMED DOWN onto the
wet pavement -- a CHOKE STICK SHOVED under his chin -- then:
VOICES. Brutal, guttural KLINGON --

KLINGON GUARD (O.S.)
(SUBTITLED)
You say they are not yours...

WHIP PAN TO SEE the scary KLINGON GUARDS -- four of them --
standing above the Alien -- chilling MASKS hide their hideous
faces -- and one holds a FLUORESCENT SET OF PAGES --

KLINGON GUARD (CONT'D)
... these Federation maps we found in
your pockets.

26
54    CONTINUED:                                                       54

And the ALIEN SPEAKS -- an UNKNOWN LANGUAGE -- all eyes wild:

ALIEN
(SUBTITLED)
I speak the truth. I do.

KLINGON GUARD
Then who are they for?

But the Alien just SHAKES HIS HEAD, afraid -- he will not talk.
So they GRAB HIM AND YANK HIM UPWARD --

KLINGON GUARD (CONT'D)
You would rather die then tell us?

PUSH IN TIGHT as the Alien finally WHISPERS, terrified:

ALIEN
... NERO!!!

And the Guards look at each other... seemingly with concern...

MOMENTS LATER EIGHT GUARDS WALK TOGETHER -- and we PAN WITH THEM
to reveal the HORRIFYING EXPANSE THAT IS THE KLINGON PRISON
YARD. We realize that the constant shocks of light was
LIGHTNING, that apparently never stops here. A SUPER READS:
"RURA PENTHE - KLINGON PRISON ASTEROID". And we see they're
heading for a MUSCULAR FIGURE, using a SLEDGE HAMMER, SPLITTING
ROCKS, lit brilliantly by the lightning strikes. BOOM UP to
find that it's NERO. And he stops, SENSING the coming Guards.
And he manages a small smile. And he QUICKLY TURNS to them --
THEY ALL STOP, SUDDENLY. Afraid of him. One of them tosses
Nero a set of MANACLES. Nero picks them up. Puts them on. And
offers his cuffed hands, willingly.

54A   INT. RURA PENTHE - HOLDING BLOCK - NIGHT  FORMER SC. 64B         54A

Guards drag Nero through the massive pyramidal structure...

54B   INT. RURA PENTHE - INTERROGATION CELL - NIGHT  FORMER SC. 64C    54B

Nero's ARMS AND LEGS get STRAPPED IN TIGHT. Go WIDE to reveal
he's pinned to an interrogation table -- three GUARDS. A
KLINGON INTERROGATOR approaches; looms over Nero, studying the
Romulan's face with clinical detachment...

KLINGON INTERROGATOR
(SUBTITLED KLINGON)
I have come far to meet you. "The One
Who Does Not Speak." Ten years is a long
time to maintain silence.
(beat)
Perhaps you simply do not speak Klingon,
just as I do not speak Romulan.
(MORE)

27
54B   CONTINUED:                                                      54B
KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
(ENGLISH now)
But I assume we both speak the language
of our common enemy.

(NOTE: FROM NOW ON, OUR NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS WILL SPEAK ENGLISH,
UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.) He reveals a worn LEATHER JOURNAL.
Opens it, flips through it almost casually... we see SKETCHES of
the JELLYFISH SHIP, PAGES OF COMPLICATED MATH EQUATIONS...

KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
We found this book in your cell.
Cartography, mathematics-- what do these
mean? This date here -- eleven years
from now-- what happens then?
(holds up the
FLUORESCENT MAPS)
And why attempt to smuggle in maps of
Federation space?

Nero's face betrays nothing; no fear, no doubt. Cold as fucking
ice.   The Interrogator happens to stare at a page in the book:
A DRAWING OF SPOCK. He closes the book.

KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
When you were captured we assumed you
were a spy, sent from Romulus to surveil
the Empire. But because the Romulans
deny your existence, I believe you are
much more than that.

Interrogator looks over to the Guards, nods. A Guard approaches
with some kind of GLASS CONTAINER; we HEAR something wet FLIP-
FLOPPING around inside, but we can't SEE what it is.

KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
Your ship remains in orbit above us now.
We've been asking for its secrets for too
long. That is why I am here. We want to
know how it works and I believe now,
finally... you will tell us.

A Guard uses TONGS to pull out the most DISGUSTING creature
you've seen from the container: a SLUG with SUCKERS and spikes,
covered in a grimy muck -- it FLIP FLOPS.

KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
Centaurian slugs. Their native planet is
in constant sunlight. As a result,
there's nothing they hate more... than
darkness.

A Guard GRABS NERO'S HEAD and FORCES IT BACK; the second PRIES
HIS MOUTH OPEN with his hands.

28
54B   CONTINUED: (2)                                                    54B

Another Guard SHOVES THE THING INTO NERO'S MOUTH -- Nero keeps
his eyes open -- furiously determined not to be broken -- as
they FORCE HIM TO SWALLOW IT -- he DOESN'T SCREAM as the
wretched thing makes its way down his esophagus and into his
stomach --

KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
They try to claw and bite their way out
of any dark space they're in.

Nero stares at the ceiling in HORRIFYING INTERNAL PAIN -- but
straining to block it out. PUSH DOWN on Nero's wide, crazed
eyes -- TIGHTER as we SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO SEE WHAT HE'S SEEING --
WHAT'S KEEPING HIM FROM LOSING HIS MIND -- DREAMLIKE, ETHEREAL
IMAGES OF A WOMAN -- HER BEAUTIFUL, SMILING FACE -- SHE'S
ROMULAN -- LOOKING AT US, EYES FULL OF LOVE -- AND SHE TURNS AND
WE SEE SHE'S PREGNANT -- AND AS OUR MUSIC BUILDS, WE CUT TO:

55-56 OMIT                                                          55-56

57    INT. VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY - COUNCIL ANTE-CHAMBER - DAY           57

Quiet. A waiting area. AMANDA, Spock's mother, stands alone in
a passageway. She looks off-camera to her son:

AMANDA
Spock, come here, let me see you.

SPOCK (O.S.)
(beat)
No.

AMANDA
Spock.

Reluctantly, Spock walks into frame. She begins adjusting his
collar. This is our ADULT SPOCK. Gripped by anxiety but trying
like hell to look impassive.

AMANDA (CONT'D)
There is no need to be so anxious.
You'll do fine.

SPOCK
I am hardly "anxious", mother.
(beat, then, anxiously)
And "fine" has variable definitions.
"Fine" is unacceptable.

She just smiles as she works his collar. He sees this and    it
annoys him. He tries to move her hands away, to stop with    his
collar -- his annoyance, her love for him, all sweet-- but   he
doesn't let go of her hands. A meaningful silence between    them.

29
57   CONTINUED:                                                           57

SPOCK (CONT'D)
May I ask a personal query?

AMANDA
... anything.

SPOCK
Should I choose to complete the Vulcan
discipline of Kolinahr... and purge all
emotion... I trust you will not feel it
reflects judgement upon you.

She stares at him, moved.      Touches his face.

AMANDA
As always... whoever you choose to be...
you will have a proud mother.

HOLD on mother and son, worlds apart but forever bonded:

58   INT. VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY                  58

An imposing yet BEAUTIFUL INDOOR ATRIUM. Spock stands before
the VULCAN HIGH COUNCIL. Among faces on the dais: his FATHER,
seated beside the SCIENCE MINISTER and other VULCAN LEADERS.

SCIENCE MINISTER
You have surpassed the expectations of
your instructors. Your final record is
flawless. With one exception. I see you
have applied to Starfleet as well.

SPOCK
It was logical to cultivate multiple
options.

SCIENCE MINISTER
Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby
accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.
A distinction all the more significant
given that you will be its first half-
human pupil. It is truly remarkable,
Spock. That you have achieved so much
despite your disadvantage. Welcome to
the Academy.

They all start to rise.      But Spock is suddenly unsettled:

SPOCK
If you would clarify, Minister-- what
"disadvantage" are you referring to?

SCIENCE MINISTER
... your human mother.

30
58   CONTINUED:                                                         58

As the council disperses, we PUSH IN on Spock's face -- the same
look he had when he took punches as a kid. He glances at his
father to say something, but Sarek's the consummate diplomat.
His eyes command: remain calm. Spock STRUGGLES... then makes
the first spontaneous -- human -- decision of his life --

SPOCK
Council -- ministers.    I must decline.

Everyone STOPS.   A solid BEAT.   Confused looks turn cold:

SCIENCE MINISTER
No Vulcan has ever declined admission to
this academy.

SPOCK
Then as I am half-human, your record
remains untarnished.

SAREK                               SPOCK
Spock. You have made a
commitment to honor the Vulcan       At the moment, Father, I can
way--                                think of no greater way to
honor our race than to attend
Starfleet as its first Vulcan.

SCIENCE MINISTER
Why did you come before this council
today? Was it to satisfy your emotional
need to rebel?

SPOCK
I came with the intention of enrolling,
as my father wished. However, your
"insight" has convinced me otherwise.
Therefore, the only emotion I wish to
convey is gratitude. Thank you,
Ministers, for your consideration.
(a contained "fuck you")
Live long and prosper.

He looks to his father, whose disappointment is evident --
still, God bless him, Spock walks out --

59   EXT. "THE WARP TRAIL" BAR - IOWA - NIGHT                              59

-- PUSH DOWN A HALLWAY -- MUSIC HEARD -- what seems like a PARTY
is going on through windows in the double-doors ahead -- and a
WOMAN SWOOPS INTO VIEW in front of us -- we PUSH BEHIND HER in
the short skirt and high boots as she ENTERS the place -- a
local, busy BAR -- the woman makes her way to the BAR, and we
see her GORGEOUS, DIGNIFIED FACE. THIS IS UHURA. She leans
into the bartender warmly, her smile glorious:

31
59   CONTINUED:                                                    59

UHURA
Hi. I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea, two
Cardassian Sunrises and three Earth
beers, no slim-shots, anything on draft.

VOICE (O.S.)
That's a lot of drinks for one woman.
Wearing those boots.

JAMES KIRK'S FACE leans in: at 22, he's charming, witty,
dangerous, rebellious. He grins at her, flirty. Uhura gives
him a look, then back to the bartender:

UHURA
And a shot of Jack, straight up.

KIRK
(to the bartender)
Make it two -- her shot's on me.

UHURA
Her shot's on her. Thanks but no thanks.

KIRK
Don't you want my name before you
completely reject me?

UHURA
I'm good without it.

Damn, he likes her already.

KIRK
You are good without it. It's Jim. Jim
Kirk.
(long beat)
If you don't tell me your name, I'm gonna
have to make one up.

UHURA
(beat)
Uhura.

KIRK
Uhura? No way -- that's the name I was
gonna make up for you. Uhura what?

UHURA
Just Uhura.

KIRK
They don't have last names in your world?

32
59   CONTINUED: (2)                                                    59

UHURA
Uhura is my last name.

KIRK
They don't have first names in your
world? Wait, let me guess. Is it "Jim"?

That makes her smile.    So he moves closer to her:

KIRK (CONT'D)
Okay, so you're a cadet. Studying.
What's your focus?

UHURA
Xenolinguistics. Lemme guess: you don't
know what that means.

KIRK
Let me guess: study of Alien languages:
phonology, morphology, syntax-- it means
you've got a talented tongue.

UHURA
And for a moment I thought you were just
a dumb hick who only has sex with farm
animals.

KIRK
Well.    Not only.

UHURA
You think you're smart.

KIRK
Oh, baby, I'm the smartest.

Something sad in that.    A BURLY STARFLEET CADET appears.

BURLY CADET
This guy bothering you?

UHURA
Beyond belief, but nothing I can't
handle.

KIRK
You could handle me.    That's an
invitation.

The Burly Cadet spins Kirk around:

BURLY CADET
Hey.    You mind your manners.

33
59   CONTINUED: (3)                                                     59

KIRK
At ease, Cup Cake, it was a joke.     Like
your hairline.

Uhura turns back.    The other cadets, seeing trouble, approach.

UHURA
Hey -- Jim: enough.

BURLY CADET
What was that?

KIRK
You heard me, Moon Beam.

BURLY CADET
You know how to count farm boy?    There's
five of us... and one of you.

KIRK
Okay, so go get some more guys, come back
and it'll be an even fight.

The cadet swings his fist but Kirk HEADBUTTS HIS HAND, BREAKING
IT -- another Cadet PUNCHES KIRK, then THROWS HIM into a table,
which Kirk FLIES OVER, landing hard -- another Cadet GRABS HIM,
pulls him up -- Kirk SLAMS FIVE FAST PUNCHES that send the Cadet
back -- when ANOTHER CADET PUNCHES HIM -- yet another HOLDS KIRK
-- and that last punch is repeated THREE-- then FOUR times --

UHURA
Enough!    STOP!

Another punch and Kirk FLIES TO THE FLOOR - he's out of it, but
won't give up. The Cadets UNLEASH on him and really PUMMEL HIM -
- and Kirk's spirited, but LOSING -- about to LOSE BAD -- when
an EAR-SPLITTING WHISTLE makes everything STOP -- they turn --
standing in the doorway is a tall, rugged Starfleet officer --
CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER PIKE.

PIKE
Outside, all of you!       NOW!

The cadets file out, in for it. Pike moves to a dazed, semi-
conscious Kirk, now upside down on a table.

PIKE (CONT'D)
Y'alright, Son?

KIRK
You can... whistle really loud, y'know
that?

-- and Kirk PASSES OUT.

34


60   OMIT                                                          60

61   INT. "WARP TRAIL BAR" - NIGHT                                 61

HIGH WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT of the almost-closed bar. Only Kirk and
Pike sit here at a table. Kirk's bloodied, tissue in his nose.

PIKE
I couldn't believe when the bartender
told me who you are.

KIRK
... and who am I, Captain Pike?

PIKE
Your father's son.
(then, smiles)
For my dissertation, I was assigned the
U.S.S. Kelvin. Something I admired about
your dad... he didn't believe in no-win
scenarios.

KIRK
He sure learned his lesson.

PIKE
Depends on how you define winning.
You're here, aren't you?
(off Kirk's look)
That instinct to leap without looking--
that was his nature, too. And in my
opinion it's something Starfleet has
lost. We're admirable, respectable. But
overly-disciplined.
(beat)
Those cadets you took on, they'll make
competent officers -- but you can bet
your ass they'll run home to momma the
minute they're looking down the barrel of
a Klingon phaser cannon.

KIRK
-- why are you talking to me?

PIKE
I looked up your file while you were
drooling on the floor. Your aptitude
tests were off the charts-- what is it,
d'you like being the only Genius Level
repeat-offender in the midwest?

KIRK
Maybe I love it.

35
61   CONTINUED:                                                       61

PIKE
So your daddy dies... you can settle for
a less-than-ordinary life.
(beat)
Or do you feel like you're meant for
something better? Something special?

And that just hangs there for a beat. Because Pike just hit a
nerve. Kirk does his best not to show it -- still absent-
mindedly fiddling with STARFLEET SHIP SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS.

KIRK
Come to think of it, I do want to feel
special. You know what? I'm gonna go
start a book club--

PIKE
Enlist in Starfleet.

KIRK
Enlist. You must be way down on your
recruiting quota for the month--

PIKE
If you're half the man your father was,
Jim, Starfleet could use you. You could
be an officer in four years, have your
own ship in eight.

He's getting under Kirk's skin -- but Kirk keeps up the 'tude,
grabs his jacket, stands --

KIRK
We're even, right?   I can go.

PIKE
Riverside shipyard. Shuttle for new
recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800.
(Kirk turns, Pike grabs
him)
Your father was Captain of a Starship.
For twelve minutes. I dare you to do
better.

Eyes lock... and it's now Pike who stands and walks off.   And
that's where it hangs. Off Kirk, brooding...

62   EXT. IOWA PLAINS - SUNRISE                                        62

CORN STALKS whipping by -- Kirk on his SPOKELESS MOTORCYCLE
rocketing across the plains -- his soul's been stirred and he's
fighting it -- he cranks it, ELECTRIC ENGINE SCREAMING --

36


63   EXT. STARFLEET CONSTRUCTION YARD - SUNRISE                       63

Kirk pulls up to us, kills the bike. Camera starts to MOVE
AROUND HIM -- he's dramatically BACKLIT and we COME AROUND for
an INCREDIBLE REVEAL of a SHIPYARD -- at its center, the
skeletal frame of a NEW SHIP under arclights. UNMISTAKABLY, THE
U.S.S. ENTERPRISE. Unformed, raw, like its future captain. Our
MUSIC SWELLS, we PUSH IN ON HIM, considering Pike's offer, his
future, his fate.

64   EXT. STARFLEET SHIPYARD - MORNING                                64

The shipyard is abuzz with activity -- cadets loading into a
shuttle -- and Pike, staring off, waiting. The PILOT
approaches:

SHUTTLE PILOT
Waiting for something, Cap?

PIKE
... No.   Guess not.

He climbs in. The pilot rapidly flips through switches, running
a pre-flight sequence. Pike straps in. Glances through the
viewshield... SEES SOMETHING... and he smiles. From his POV:
KIRK on his MOTORCYCLE, driving into the shipyard --

PIKE (CONT'D)
Hold her a second...

Kirk rides past a WATERFALL of cooling tanks -- stops the bike
near the shuttle -- steps off, has nothing -- no bags -- just
the clothes on his back.

SHIPYARD WORKER
Nice ride, man.

Kirk kicks the stand, tosses the guy the startcard --

KIRK
Live it up.

Kirk walks past the startled worker and approaches Pike.

KIRK (CONT'D)
Four years?   I'm gonna do it in three.

Pike grins as Kirk passes him.

Inside the shuttle, Kirk moves down rows of new recruits, some
of them ALIEN. Passes UHURA and the BARFIGHT CADETS, who PERK
UP when they see him -- one has a BANDAGED HAND.

37
64   CONTINUED:                                                      64

KIRK (CONT'D)
At ease, Gentlemen.
(then, to Uhura)
Never did get that first name.

UHURA
(can't help it: a grin)
And you never will.

He smiles as he takes a seat at the back of the shuttle.   Straps
in as it RISES...

MAN'S VOICE
Are you people deaf? I told you I don't
need a doctor, damnit! I AM A DOCTOR!

Kirk turns to see a MAN being forced OUT of the BATHROOM by a
FEMALE FLIGHT OFFICER -- at 34, he has a Southern lilt and looks
like a prisoner waiting for the guillotine to fall:

FLIGHT OFFICER                          MAN
-- you need to find a seat --     -- I had one, in the bathroom,
Darlin', with no windows --
-- Sir, for your own safety,      -- I suffer from Aviaphobia,
siddown, or I will MAKE you       case you don't understand big
sit down... do you hear me?       words, it means 'fear of dying
RIGHT NOW.                        in something that flies.'

They GLARE at each other, then the man drops into the seat
beside Kirk. The ship TORQUES to one side and the man GRIPS his
armrests, pale, sweating -- glances at Kirk:

MAN
I might throw up on you.

KIRK
I think these things're pretty safe--

MAN
Don't pander to me, kid: one tiny crack
in the hull and our blood boils in
thirteen seconds -- solar flare might
crop up, cook us in our seats -- Hell,
some of the damn passengers are blue.
And wait'll you're sitting pretty with a
case of Andorian shingles, see if you're
still so relaxed when your eyeballs are
bleeding-- space is disease and danger,
wrapped in darkness and silence.

KIRK
I hate to break this to you, but
Starfleet operates in space.

38
64    CONTINUED: (2)                                                   64

MAN
Yeah, well my ex-wife took the whole damn
planet in the divorce, I got nowhere to
go but up. Leonard McCoy.

KIRK
Jim Kirk-- you really gonna throw up--?

MCCOY
Maybe--

As the TREK THEME SOARS, the shuttle ascends and we...

FADE OUT.

OVER BLACK: "THREE YEARS LATER".

FADE IN:

64A-E OMIT                                                          64A-E

64F   INT. NERO'S CELL - NIGHT                                         64F

Nero lies on the floor of his cell, semi-conscious, looking like
death. Behind him the DOOR OPENS. Two KLINGON GUARDS enter,
backlit.

KLINGON GUARD  1
The day you've been waiting for is upon
us, Silent One. And look. No sign of
salvation. No sign of change. Just more
pain.

And they both lift his limp body up -- as something miraculous
happens -- NERO SNAPS TO LIFE AND SINGLE-HANDEDLY BEATS THE SHIT
OUT OF THE GUARDS -- TAKING THEM BOTH DOWN IN TEN SECONDS -- in
what seems like an instant, he's the only one standing here --
holding both of the Guards' rifles -- which he TWIRLS, badass.

64G   INT. AYEL'S CELL - NIGHT                                         64G

PUSH IN ON THE DOOR as it opens -- Ayel, chained, looks up,
intensely -- and sees that it's NERO who has arrived -- we PUSH
IN TIGHT ON HIM as he SPEAKS FOR THE FIRST TIME:

NERO
The wait is over.

Off Ayel, we CUT TO:

39


64H   EXT. STARFLEET ACADEMY GROUNDS - DAY    FORMER SC. 82          64H

TILT DOWN from a GLIMMERING BUILDING TO REVEAL a sea of RED
CADET UNIFORMS: HUNDREDS OF CADETS head across campus, McCoy and
Kirk among them. A miraculous view of San Francisco beneath a
blue sky, Golden Gate Bridge piercing the air. Kirk struts:

KIRK
So you'll do it for me, right?

MCCOY
I have no interest.

KIRK
I didn't ask if you have interest, I
asked if you'd do it.

MCCOY
I'm about to ask you an obvious question:
why bother?

KIRK
Because I've failed the test twice.

MCCOY
And you're determined to make it three.
We've all failed it-- everyone has, and
that's the point! No one goes back for
seconds, let alone thirds -- it's not
like you need to pass it to graduate.

KIRK
So Bones: why do they make us take it?

MCCOY
I told you to stop calling me that.
You're very annoying.

KIRK
And you're the greatest -- thank you.

MCCOY
You'd better study for it this time.

KIRK
Oh, no-- Bones -- I gotta date.

40
64H   CONTINUED:                                                         64H

MCCOY
A date? Listen, as smart as you are,
which ain't much, if you don't prepare--

KIRK
You have no idea how prepared I'm gonna
be-- no idea.

And with a smile, Kirk heads off -- McCoy watches him go,
calling after him:

MCCOY
Seriously, stop calling me Bones!
(to himself, hating it)
"Bones".

65-78 OMIT                                                           65-78

79    INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT                                               79

In MOONLIGHT, a beautiful WOMAN lies on her back, in some kind
of bra, moaning in delight -- this is GAILA --

GAILA
-- oh Jim... Jim... Jim, I love you.

KIRK
(kissing her)
... Yeah. I sent you a message.

Gaila reaches over, turns on the light and we realize: SHE'S
GREEN. And not particularly happy:

GAILA
I say "I love you", and you say "I sent
you a message?"

KIRK                                GAILA
-- but you can only open it
tomorrow at three o'clock on
the dot --                        -- what are you talking about?
What is it? What does it say?
-- Gaila, promise me you're
not going to open it 'till        -- what is it?    Tell me what
three --                          it says!

-- I'll erase it, I swear, if
you don't promise me you'll       -- All right!!    Three o'clock!
wait --                           I prom--

They're INTERRUPTED by a DOOR OPENING -- GASP!

41
79   CONTINUED:                                                        79

GAILA (CONT'D)
(sotto)
You can't get caught in this dorm-- hide!
Under the bed, quick!

Kirk falls, lands hard on the floor, SCRAMBLES under the bed as
Gaila's roommate enters -- UHURA. Dropping her backpack:

GAILA (CONT'D)
Hey-- I thought you were going to be in
the long-range sensor lab all night.

UHURA
I was supposed to be, but it was crazy, I
picked up an emergency transmission from
a Klingon prison planet -- there was an
escape and a ship stolen from th--
(suddenly senses)
... you okay?

GAILA
Yeah, been running simulations all week,
just catching up on some rest. Tired.
(fake yawn)
That's all.

Uhura watches her.   Her eyes narrow.

UHURA
Were you running simulations with the
mouth-breather hiding under the bed?

Gaila freezes, caught.   Uhura looks down, Kirk PEERS OUT.

KIRK
Your hearing is scary-- you sure both
your parents are human?

UHURA
The hell are you doing with him in here?

GAILA                              JIM
I can't help it! I love him!      Gaila loves me--

UHURA (CONT'D)
Get outta here -- it's my ass too if
administration catches you in this dorm.

KIRK
(getting dressed, to
Uhura)
You and I have a big day tomorrow --

42
79   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  79

UHURA
(pushing him out)
You're gonna fail.

KIRK
If I pass, will you tell me your first
name?

UHURA
No.   Good night.

KIRK
(quiet, tries to charm)
I think the fact that you picked up a
transmission of a Klingon prison escape
is very interesting.

SHE CLOSES THE DOOR ON HIM and we CUT TO:

80   EXT. SPACE - NIGHT                                              80

The Narada APPEARS through space --

81   INT. NARADA - BRIDGE - DAY                                      81

Dead silence on the bridge... all eyes on the VIEWSCREENS: empty
starfield, roiling clouds of methane ice.

AYEL
We have arrived at the coordinates you
requested. Stardate confirmed. 2258.5.

Nero stands, looks out through his view screens.

NERO
Standby.

Ayel studies his console, hope in his eyes.     Quietly:

AYEL
Captain... long range scans of Beta
Quadrant complete. Romulus is there.
She's there. We could go. Right now, go
home...

NERO
Not yet -- not like this. Not how we
left. This is our chance... to serve our
people. We owe it to them -- to do what
no other Romulan could ever do.

43
81    CONTINUED:                                                          81

Ayel hides his disappointment behind his eyes as suddenly -- A
LIGHTNING STORM -- impossibly, from nowhere -- LOTS OF IT -- and
through the lightning erupts THE JELLYFISH -- THE SHIP NERO HAS
BEEN LOOKING FOR DECADES.

NERO (CONT'D)
Welcome back.    Spock.

And we won't know where we are as MUSIC BUILDS and we CUT TO:

81A   INT. U.S.S. TRAINER - BRIDGE - SPACE      FORMER SC. 65             81A

Uhura TURNS TO US, at her comm station -- PUSH IN on her.     She
seems wildly BORED and almost RESENTFUL:

UHURA
-- we are receiving a distress signal
from the U.S.S. Kobayashi Maru. The ship
has lost power and is stranded.
Starfleet Command has ordered us to
rescue them.

WHIP TO THE COMMAND CHAIR, where KIRK captains the battered
bridge. Confident -- cocky:

KIRK
"Starfleet Command has ordered us to
rescue them... Captain."

She glares, turns away.      Then McCoy, at a console, reports:

MCCOY
Klingon vessels have entered the Neutral
Zone. And they are firing upon us.

KIRK
That's okay.

McCoy and Uhura -- and the others -- look at him, confused.

MCCOY
It's okay?

KIRK
Yeah, don't worry about it.

McCoy and Uhura share a look -- that's when we CUT TO:

81B   INT. TESTING CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS  FORMER SC. 66              81B

Looking at the bridge from above, we PULL BACK to reveal an
observation room above the faux-ship. This is the test Kirk was
referring to. CONSOLE TECHNICIANS monitor the proceedings. A
TEST ADMINISTRATOR turns to another and asks:

44
81B   CONTINUED:                                                         81B

TEST ADMINISTRATOR  1
Did he say "don't worry about it"?

TEST ADMINISTRATOR  2
-- what's he doing?

And we CONTINUE TO PULL BACK TO REVEAL that, sitting among the
technicians, is Gaila. Our resident GREEN GIRL. She checks her
watch -- PUSH IN ON IT: 2:59 PM. On her MONITOR awaits a 23rd
century e-mail -- a MESSAGE FROM KIRK --

81C   INT. U.S.S. TRAINER - BRIDGE SIMULATOR - DAY     FORMER SC. 67     81C

MCCOY
Three more Klingon Warbirds decloaking --
and targeting our ship -- I don't suppose
this is a problem either?

KIRK
Nah.

WEAPONS OFFICER
They're firing, Captain.

KIRK
Alert medical bay to prepare to receive
all crew members from the damaged ship.

UHURA
And how do you expect us to rescue them
when we're surrounded by Klingons?

KIRK
Alert medical.

Annoyed, she does as:

MCCOY
Our ship is being hit -- shields at sixty
percent.

KIRK
I understand.

MCCOY
Should we at least, I dunno, fire back?

KIRK
Mmmm... no.

MCCOY
Of course not.

45


81D   INT. TESTING CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS  FORMER SC. 70            81D

CLOSE ON GAILA'S WATCH as it changes to 3:00 -- and she   opens
Jim's message -- and all it reads is, "I'M SORRY." And    just
then something UPLOADS and EXECUTES and ALL THE SCREENS   IN HERE
AND ON THE BRIDGE DIE -- THE SYSTEM CRASHES -- everyone   reacts --

TEST ADMINISTRATOR  1
-- the hell's happening?!

81E   INT. U.S.S. TRAINER - BRIDGE SIMULATOR - CONTINUOUS  FRMR. 71     81E

The crew doesn't know what's up -- except Kirk, who is
remarkably pleased -- when the LIGHTS AND MONITORS COME BACK ON,
things are not the same:

UHURA
(perplexed, works
controls)
-- the Kobayashi Maru is still in
distress... but... the Klingons have
stopped firing.

KIRK
Arm photons. Prepare to fire on the
Klingon warbirds.

MCCOY
Jim, their shields are up.

KIRK
Are they?

McCoy looks at his monitor.   No they're not.

MCCOY
... no.

KIRK
Fire on all enemy ships -- one photon
each should do -- let's not waste
ammunition.

WEAPONS OFFICER
Target lock acquired on all warbirds --
firing!

They fire -- AND DESTROY ALL FIVE KLINGON SHIPS INSTANTLY.    All
mouths here are agape.

46
81E   CONTINUED:                                                         81E

KIRK
Begin rescue of the stranded crew. So.
We've eliminated all enemy ships, no one
on board was injured and the successful
rescue of the Kobayashi Maru crew is
underway.

For the first time, Kirk looks up to the testing room windows:

KIRK (CONT'D)
Anything else?

81F   INT. TESTING CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS  FORMER SC. 72             81F

And they're stunned up here, too -- Test Administrator  2 turns
to someone OFF-CAMERA:

TEST ADMINISTRATOR  2
How the hell'd that kid beat your test?

REVEAL who he was talking to: SPOCK is here.      And not happy.

SPOCK
... I do not know.

82    OMIT                                                                82

83    INT. ACADEMY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY                                 83

TIGHT ON a stern STARFLEET ACADEMY PRESIDENT:

ACADEMY PRESIDENT
James T. Kirk.     Step forward.

It's a huge Starfleet chamber. Golden Gate Bridge visible
through huge windows. 500 cadets, a nervous KIRK among them.
He stands, moves to one of two PODIUMS.

ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
An incident has occurred today that
concerns the entire student body.
Academic immorality by one is an assault
on us all. It will. Not. Stand. Cadet
Kirk, evidence has been submitted to this
council suggesting you violated the
ethical code of conduct pursuant to
regulation 17.43 of the Starfleet code.
Is there anything you care to say before
we begin?

KIRK
(uncomfortable beat)
Yessir. I believe I have the right to
face my accuser directly.

47
83   CONTINUED:                                                      83

President nods toward the assembly. SPOCK RISES. He and Kirk
MEET EYES for the first time. It's clock-stopping.

ACADEMY PRESIDENT
Step forward please. This is Commander
Spock, one of our most distinguished
graduates. He's programmed the Kobayashi
Maru test for the last four years.

Spock steps up to the OTHER PODIUM.      President nods.

SPOCK
Cadet Kirk. It is obvious you somehow
managed to install and activate a sub-
routine in the programming code, thereby
changing the conditions of the test.

We happen to find GAILA, in the crowd, fucking pissed.

KIRK
Your point being?

ACADEMY PRESIDENT
In academic vernacular, you cheated.

KIRK
Respectfully.    Define "cheating".

SPOCK
To deceive by trickery.

KIRK
Now let me ask you something I think we
all know the answer to: the test is
rigged, isn't it? You programmed it to
be unwinnable.

ACADEMY PRESIDENT
Mr. Kirk, I don't see how the intent of
the exam is relevant to these
proceedings.

KIRK
Because if I'm right, Sir, then the test
itself is a cheat.

SPOCK
Your argument precludes the possibility
of a no-win scenario --

KIRK
I don't believe in no-win scenarios --

48
83   CONTINUED: (2)                                                      83

FIND PIKE amongst the officers in attendance. His eyes locked
on Kirk. This is his boy. His recruit. And he's INVESTED.

SPOCK
Then not only have you violated the
rules, you've failed to understand the
principle lesson.

KIRK
Please, enlighten me.

SPOCK
You, of all people should know, Cadet
Kirk -- A captain cannot cheat death.

ON KIRK. The first punch by Spock that landed.      The cockiness
slips away as he senses where this is going --

KIRK
"I of all people?"

SPOCK
Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk, had
assumed command of his vessel before
killed in action, did he not?

Shit.   The DADDY card.   Kirk, a mix of ANGER and EMBARRASSMENT --

KIRK
How long did it take you to look that up?

SPOCK
How long did it take you to program the
virus that allowed you to cheat?

The President smirks; considers ending this now but doesn't,
it's just too damn entertaining...

KIRK
Maybe you just don't like that I beat
your test.

SPOCK
I am Vulcan. "Like" is not a verb in our
vernacular. I've simply made the logical
deduction that you're a liar.

KIRK
What an idiot I am for taking that
personally --

SPOCK
Agreed. Furthermore, you have failed to
divine the purpose of the test.

48A
83   CONTINUED: (3)                                                   83

KIRK
Enlighten me again.

SPOCK
The purpose is to experience fear. Fear
in the face of certain death. To accept
that fear and maintain command of one's
self and one's crew. This is a quality
expected in every Starfleet captain.

Kirk absorbs that.   Then --

KIRK
So you're telling me the point.      Of the
whole thing. Is to be afraid?

SPOCK
Fear is necessary, yes.

KIRK
Have you taken the test, Commander Spork?

SPOCK
Spock. As a Vulcan, I require no
additional training to control my
narcissism when making command decisions.

No he DIN'T!   Kirk's hit guys for a lot less -- The crowd all
but "OOOOOOHs." But Kirk ain't fucking done yet.

KIRK
You keep reminding me that you're Vulcan.
And I'm sure you're really proud of that,
who wouldn't be-- but isn't it true you
people don't experience fear at all?

ON SPOCK. He raises that eyebrow. And Kirk sees... no matter
how subtly... that he has fucking made CONTACT. Smelling blood -
-

KIRK (CONT'D)
And if that's the case -- What's that say
about your ability to make command
decisions?

Well. Looks like Kirk just hit him in HIS fucking weak spot.
And before this lovefest can continue --

49
83   CONTINUED: (4)                                                   83

A REDSHIRT bursts into the HALL -- Kirk turns to look -- they
all do -- now we're SPEEDING IN behind the REDSHIRT, who runs to
the President, hands him a DATAPAD. President reads it.
Everyone watches, on edge -- finally, quietly:

ACADEMY PRESIDENT
(to all)
We've received a distress call from
Vulcan.
(Spock reacts concerned)
Cadet Kirk -- you are on academic
probation pending the result of your
hearing. Cadets, report to Shuttle
Hangar One immediately -- this hearing is
at recess until further notice --
dismissed.

Everyone's on their feet, MOVING QUICKLY, Kirk suddenly
irrelevant. PIKE passes by him, all fucking business, but
before he goes --

PIKE
Cheating isn't winning.

And as that settles on Kirk, McCoy now joins him. The two
exiting with the rest of the cadets as Kirk eyes SPOCK --

KIRK
Who was that pointy-eared bastard?

MCCOY
I don't know, but I like him.

84   INT. STARFLEET ACADEMY - HANGAR - CONTINUOUS                      84

DOLLY THROUGH HUNDREDS OF CADETS, racing to their shuttles --
BARRACKS LEADERS stand on platforms, calling out SHIP
ASSIGNMENTS -- cadets HURRYING OFF as they're called --

MALE BARRACKS LEADER             FEMALE BARRACKS OFFICER
Blake! U.S.S. Newton!             Jaxa! The U.S.S. Endeavor!

U.S.S. Wolcott! McCoy!            Uhura! The U.S.S. Farragut!
U.S.S. Enterprise! Welcome to
Starfleet and Godspeed!

As the last of the cadets head off, Kirk stands there without a
home -- he moves to his exiting Barracks Leader --

KIRK
Excuse me, you didn't call my name.
Kirk, James T..

50
84   CONTINUED:                                                         84

BARRACKS LEADER
(checks his tablet)
You're on academic probation. That means
you're grounded until the Academy Board
rules.

Kirk is POLEAXED as Leader heads off -- McCoy, needing to run:

MCCOY
... Jim, the Board'll rule in your favor.
Most likely.
(Kirk is just rocked)
Look, Jim -- I gotta go --

KIRK
... yeah-- yeah, you go... I'm good.

Kirk forces a half-smile. Torn, McCoy hurries off. PULL AWAY
from Kirk, alone as the mass of newly-minted cadets criss-
crosses around him. At the hangar entrance, McCoy suddenly
STOPS: a lightbulb. He quickly returns to Kirk, pulls him off:

MCCOY                              KIRK
Come with me --                    -- what're you doing --?

TRACK with them as they hurry through the throng of cadets --
and suddenly we're moving in the OTHER DIRECTION as a pissed-off
Uhura serpentines through the group to SPOCK --

UHURA
Commander, a word?

Spock moves away from the officers, a private moment with her:

SPOCK
Yes, Lieutenant?

UHURA
Was I not one of your top students?

SPOCK
Indeed you were --

UHURA
Did I not receive a Gold rating for
Exolinguistic skills, giving Starfleet
first place over Kyoto and MIT at the
Oxford Invitational?

A LOUD nearby SHUTTLE LEAVES BEHIND THEM -- it gets WINDY --

SPOCK
An exceptional achievement, to be su--

51
84   CONTINUED: (2)                                                    84

UHURA
-- and did I not, on multiple occasions,
demonstrate exceptional aural sensitivity
and, I quote, "unparalleled ability to
identify sonic anomalies" in subspace
transmission tests?!

SPOCK
Consistently, yes--

UHURA
And while you were well aware that my
unqualified desire was to serve on the
U.S.S. Enterprise, I was assigned to the
Farragut.

Spock reacts unusually; he seems almost embarrassed.   Quiet.

SPOCK
It was an attempt to avoid the appearance
of favoritism.

She gets closer, voice low, all pride and defiance:

UHURA
No. No. I am assigned to the
Enterprise.

Their eyes hold.    He checks his tablet, makes an change:

SPOCK
Oh.     Yes, I believe you are.

85   INT. SHUTTLE HANGAR MEDICAL BAY - CONTINUOUS                      85

McCoy and Kirk enter fast. McCoy goes through a cabinet, preps
a med in a hypospray SYRINGE.

KIRK
What are you doing?

MCCOY
Doing you a favor. I couldn't just leave
you there, looking all pitiful-- roll up
your sleeve, I'm gonna give you a vaccine
against viral infection from Melvaran mud
fleas.

McCoy FIRES the Hypospray --

52
85    CONTINUED:                                                          85

KIRK                                MCCOY
Ow-- what for?                      To give you symptoms.
-- I don't understand--             -- you're gonna start to lose
vision in your left eye --
-- yeah, I already have --          -- don't stand up yet --
(he tries to stand;
WOOZY)
-- what'd you do to me?             -- you're gonna get a really
(in pain)                        bad headache. And flopsweat.
-- this is a favor?!                -- yeah, you're welcome.

McCoy ushers Kirk out of the room --

86    EXT. STARFLEET ACADEMY - HANGAR - CONTINUOUS                        86

McCoy ushers Kirk to a shuttle -- a SCANNING OFFICER stops them:

SCANNING OFFICER
"Kirk, James T." -- he's not cleared for
duty aboard the Enterprise --

MCCOY
But I am, and Medical Code states the
treatment and transport of a patient's to
be determined at the discretion of his
attending physician, which is me.
(re: scanner)
You can see he's suffering, he needs me
as his doctor, so since I'm assigned to
this ship, so's he, or would you like to
explain to Captain Pike why the
Enterprise warped into a crisis without
one of its medical officers?

SCANNING OFFICER
... as you were.

MCCOY
As you were.

And with that, he pulls Kirk past the speechless officer --

86A   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY                                            86A

A fleet of SHUTTLES depart Starfleet -- head out to space --

87    INT. SHUTTLE - DAY                                                  87

Kirk, in agony, sweating, sits beside McCoy as they pass through
the stratosphere. McCoy's peering out a window --

KIRK
I might throw up on you.

53
87   CONTINUED:                                                        87

MCCOY
You should look at this.

And through his pain, Kirk does... and is amazed...

88   INT. STARBASE ONE - SPACE DOCK - CONTINUOUS                       88

The shuttle approaches a massive DOCKING STATION where a dozen
STARFLEET VESSELS ARE DOCKED. But the ship we're approaching is
miraculous: "U.S.S. ENTERPRISE NCC-1701" IS REVEALED ON THE HULL
OF THE FLAGSHIP. THE QUEEN OF THE FLEET IS FULLY CONSTRUCTED
AND READY FOR HER MAIDEN VOYAGE. The shuttle glides to the
underside of the Enterprise. A DOCKING BAY opens --

89   INT. ENTERPRISE SHUTTLE BAY WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS                  89

Officers move quickly on the ship -- Kirk and McCoy enter.    Kirk
WIPING HIS BROW, pretty much SOAKED.

KIRK
Bones. Thanks for getting me on board.
But I don't feel right. I feel like I'm
leaking.

MCCOY
Oh look, the pointy-eared bastard.

Kirk looks up -- SPOCK moves towards them, not seeing them --
Kirk yanks McCoy out of the way -- Spock passes and enters a
TURBOLIFT -- Kirk looks back as the doors close.

Then we go INTO THE TURBOLIFT -- for just a moment -- as the
doors open and we enter with Spock:

90   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                             90

Spock walks through the glorious, gleaming new space, taking his
position at the SCIENCE CONSOLE. PIKE at the command chair.

SPOCK
Captain, engineering reports "ready for
launch".

PIKE
The maiden voyage of our newest flagship
deserves more pomp and circumstance than
we can afford today, but her christening
will have to be our reward for a safe
return--
(toggles intercom)
All decks, this is Captain Pike. Prepare
for immediate departure. Helm,
thrusters.

90    CONTINUED:                                                          90

WHIP PAN to the helm: HIKARU SULU turns to Pike -- at 25, he's
the Federation's best pilot. As he works the controls:

SULU
Moorings retracted, Captain. Dock
Control reports ready -- thrusters fired,
separating from space dock --

90A   EXT. SPACE DOCK - SPACE  FORMER SC. 92                              90A

The Enterprise moves away from the dock -- smaller SATELLITE
crafts floating around it. The other FIVE STARFLEET SHIPS
already ahead -- moving into position.

91    INT. MEDICAL BAY - CONTINUOUS                                       91

MEDICAL STAFF preps. McCoy enters with Kirk, in amusing agony --
McCoy helps him onto a bed, prepares another hypospray.

KIRK                                   MCCOY
-- oh, this wasn't worth it --
I wish I didn't know you-- I'm
itching in my mouth, this is         Here's a short-lasting
horrible--                           sedative -- those symptoms
won't last long, don't be an
infant.

And he SHOOTS KIRK with another hypospray --

92    OMIT                                                                92

As Sulu works the controls --

SULU
The fleet's cleared space dock, Captain.
All ships ready for warp.

PIKE
Set course for Vulcan.

SULU
Course laid in.

PIKE
Maximum warp.    Punch it.

And Sulu does and --

94    EXT. STARBASE ONE - CONTINUOUS                                      94

The six ships -- ONE, then TWO, then THREE, then FOUR, then FIVE
SNAP INTO WARP. The Enterprise, however... just sits there.

55


95    INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                             95

Pike -- and the others -- look at Sulu, who is confused --
concerned -- searching the controls. Finally:

PIKE
Lieutenant, where's Helmsman McKenna?

SULU
Uh, he has lungworms, Sir? He'll be fine
but couldn't report to his post-- I'm
Hikaru Sulu --

PIKE
(fucking with him)
-- and you are a pilot, right?

SULU
Very much so, Sir-- I'm not sure
what's... wrong here...

PIKE
Is the parking brake on?

SULU
(half-laughs)
-- no, I'll figure it out, just--

SPOCK
Have you disengaged the External Inertial
Dampener?

Sulu does -- and realizes Spock is right.     He makes it work.

SULU
Ready for warp, Sir.

PIKE
The external inertial dampener.
That's... the parking brake.

SULU
(essentially)
... yessir.

PIKE
(laughs)
Let's punch it!

95A   EXT. STARBASE ONE - SPACE DOCK - CONTINUOUS                       95A

And now alone, the Enterprise SNAPS INTO WARP -- and is gone.

95B   INT. EXT. AMANDA AND SAREK'S HOME - VULCAN - DAY  FRMR SC. 99      95B

CLOSE ON a small Vulcan object. SHAKING, as if in a small
earthquake. BOOM UP to find Amanda as she moves through her
home, out to the balcony -- and in the distance, a mile away, is
a massive COLUMN OF LIGHT -- like a ray from God, which creates
NUKE-LIKE CONCENTRIC CLOUDS and massive DIRT AND DUST, slamming
into the ground. Amanda's eyes go wide with terror --

95C   EXT. DRILLING MACHINE - DAY                                        95C

Looking DOWN towards Vulcan at the gigantic DRILLING PLATFORM,
the SOURCE of the PLASMA RAY -- and we TILT UP to see that the
platform is HUNG ON A WIDE TETHER -- and we KEEP TILTING UNTIL
WE SEE THE TETHER IS ATTACHED TO THE NARADA, in orbit above the
planet --

95D   INT. NARADA - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                                  95D

Nero stares at holographic images of Vulcan -- as Ayel arrives
behind him.

ROMULAN CREW MEMBER
Captain Nero, drilling has begun.

NERO
Prepare the Red Matter.    Tell me when we
reach core depth.

Ayel heads off --

95E   INT. NARADA - HANGAR - LATER    FORMERLY SC. 101                   95E

Ayel enters the massive hangar -- where SPOCK'S JELLYFISH SHIP
SITS. Ayel moves to, enters the Jellyfish --

95F   INT. JELLY FISH - LATER                                            95F

Ayel moves into the CONTAINMENT HOLD -- a METALLIC ROOM
containing a large, floating RED BALL -- some kind of energy
source. Ayel observes TWO ROMULANS EXTRACTING some of this Red
Matter, sucking it into a tube --

95G   INT. NARADA - HANGAR - LATER                                       95G

PIKE
Russian whiz kid-- what's your name

An 18 YEAR-OLD FACE leans into frame.   HEAVY RUSSIAN ACCENT:

CHEKOV
Ensign Chekov, Pavel H., Sir.

PIKE
Fine, Chekov, Pavel H.: begin shipwide
mission broadcast.

CHEKOV
Yessir, happy to.

Ensign authorization code: Nine-Five-

"AUTHORIZATION NOT RECOGNIZED, PLEASE TRY AGAIN." Chekov is a

Nine-Five-Victor-Victor-Two.

"ACCESS GRANTED: INTRA-SHIP COMMUNICATION ACTIVE."

CHEKOV ON SCREEN
Your attention, plees: At twenty-two
hundred hours, telemetry detected an
anomaly in the Neutral Zone. What
appeared to be a lightning storm in
space.

97   INT. THE ENTERPRISE - SERIES OF SHOTS - CONTINUOUS                97

CHEKOV'S FACE appears on monitors throughout the great ship,
including ENGINEERING: CRANE DOWN 12 stories of catwalks as
engineers tend to the DILITHIUM CRYSTAL CHAMBER that operates
the warp drive --

CHEKOV ON SCREEN
Soon after, Starfleet received a distress
signal from the Vulcan High Council that
their planet was experiencing seismic
activity. We then lost contact with
Vulcan entirely.

WEAPONS BAY: TRACKING DOWN rows of PHOTON TORPEDOES stacked for

VARIOUS SHOTS of the Crew at work in DIFFERENT SHIP LOCALS.

CHEKOV ON SCREEN (CONT'D)
Our mission is to assess the condition of
Vulcan and assist in evacuations, if
necessary.

MEDICAL BAY: as the med staff sets up a triage area --

CHEKOV ON SCREEN (CONT'D)
We should be arriving at Vulcan within
two minutes. Thank you for your time.

And as Chekov's message ends, Kirk suddenly SITS UP IN FRAME --
his mind SPINNING, through the pain and sedative -- he tries to
get off the bed, to his feet, as McCoy hurries over --

MCCOY
Jim, I told you to stay d-- good God!

What McCoy has just seen -- what we and Kirk see now -- is that
KIRK'S HANDS HAVE SWOLLEN TO ALMOST TWO TIMES THEIR NORMAL SIZE.

KIRK
-- what's this?!

MCCOY
-- I don't know-- a reaction to the
vaccine -- damnit --

Kirk rushes to the video monitor where Chekov was seen -- using
his huge hands, he REWINDS CHEKOV'S SPEECH -- replays this part
as McCoy SCANS KIRK WITH A HANDHELD DIAGNOSER --

CHEKOV ON SCREEN
-- telemetry detected an anomaly in the
Neutral Zone. What appeared to be a
lightning storm in space.

He FREEZES it -- eyes wild -- looks to McCoy --

KIRK
-- Bones -- we have to stop the ship--

MCCOY

dander, are you?

KIRK
--- what? How the hell would I know?     Is
Uhura on board?

MCCOY
Jim, I'm not kidding, you gotta keep your
heart rate down.

KIRK
Computer, locate crew member Uhura --

MCCOY
I haven't seen a reaction this severe
since Med school.

A MAP appears -- locates her --

COMPUTER VOICE
Lieutenant Uhura is at signals monitoring
station twelve -- deck four.

KIRK
We're flying into a trap.

Kirk RUNS OUT -- McCoy hurrying after him with a bag of gear:

MCCOY
You're delusional, you know that.


98    INT. SIGNALS MONITORING STATION - CONT.                          98

Kirk and McCoy enter -- Kirk stops, looks around --

MCCOY
Come here -- Jim -- don't move --

And McCoy INJECTS HIM WITH ANOTHER SHOT --

KIRK
-- ow!   Stop it!

And Kirk runs into a ENORMOUS SPACE -- giant STEEL COLLECTOR
TANKS surround a dozen workstations where CREW MEMBERS collect
data -- Kirk races to Uhura --

KIRK (CONT'D)
The transmission from the Klingon prison
planet -- what exactly did you hear?

UHURA
What are you doing here-- what happened
to your hands?!

Kirk hides his hands behind his back -- as he talks it becomes
MUFFLED AND SLURRED --

KIRK
Who was it who escaped? What was the
ship that was stolen--?!
(to McCoy,
indiscernible)
-- what's happening to my mouth?

MCCOY
(working Hypospray)
-- you've got Numb Tongue --

KIRK
(impossible to make out)
Numb tongue?

MCCOY
That's not good-- I can fix that--

Kirk grabs a pen with his huge hands and writes -- shows her
what he's written: "THE SHIP - WAS IT ROMULAN?" Uhura looks at
him -- somehow scared -- as McCoy INJECTS HIM AGAIN:

KIRK
OW, DAMNIT!!!    SONOFABITCH!

you get on board the                 This man is under the
Enterprise?!                         influence of a severe reaction

delusional and I take full
responsibility for --

KIRK (CONT'D)
Vulcan isn't experiencing a natural
disaster, it's being attacked -- by
Romulans.

ON THE CREW as that lands.     But most specifically, SPOCK.

PIKE
Cadet Kirk, I think you've had enough
attention for one day -- Dr. McCoy,
return to medical, we'll have words
later.

MCCOY
Yessir.

Rebuked, McCoy exits as:

SPOCK                                 KIRK
As you know, Mr. Kirk is not
cleared to be aboard this
vessel. By Starfleet                  Yeah, I get it, you're a
regulations, that makes him a        great arguer, I'd love to do
stowaway...                          it again with you, too.

I can remove the cadet from          -- Try it! This cadet is
the bridge, Sir --                   trying to save the bridge!
-- By recommending a full stop
in trans-warp in the midst of
a rescue mission?                    -- It's not a rescue mission--
listen to me! It's an attack!
-- Based on what facts?

ON KIRK.   Enough.     And cadet or not, the bridge is HIS.

KIRK
Fact: the same anomaly -- a lighting
storm in space -- that we saw today also
occurred on the day of my birth, before a
Romulan ship attacked the U.S.S. Kelvin.
(to Pike)
You know that, I read your dissertation.
Which was good.

KIRK (CONT'D)
Fact: This ship -- which had formidable
and advanced weaponry -- was never seen
or heard from again -- fact: the Kelvin
attack took place on the edge of Klingon
space and at 11-hundred hours last night
there was an escape from a Klingon prison
planet -- Rura Penthe -- fact: the
escaped prisoners were Romulans, Sir, and
it was reported that they stole a ship
from the prison dock.

PIKE
And you know of this prison escape how?

Kirk just points to Uhura.

UHURA
Sir, I-- I intercepted and translated the
message myself. Kirk's report is
accurate.

KIRK
We're warping into a trap-- there are
Romulans waiting for us, I promise you
that.

All eyes on Pike.   He looks to Spock, who could screw Kirk
here... But--

SPOCK
The cadet's logic is sound.
(then)
And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched in
xenolinguistics, we would be wise to
accept her conclusion.

PIKE
(to Comm Officer)
Scan Vulcan space, check if any
transmissions are being made in Romulan.

COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
Sir, I'm-- not sure I could distinguish
the Romulan language from Vulcan.

PIKE
(to Uhura)
How about you -- you speak Romulan,
Cadet...?

UHURA
Uhura, Sir.   All three dialects.

PIKE
Uhura, relieve the Lieutenant -- Mr.
Hannity, hail the U.S.S. Truman.

Uhura sits at the console -- she PUTS ON THE EARPIECE. We've
just watched the birth of an icon. She works the controls --

HANNITY
The other ships are out of warp and have
arrived at Vulcan, Sir-- but we seem to
have lost all contact--

UHURA
Captain, I pick up no Romulan
transmissions -- or transmissions of any
kind in the area. There seems to be
something jamming all communication
around Vulcan.

KIRK
It's because they're being attacked.
Captain. Please.

PIKE
(long, tense beat)
Shields up. Ready all weapons.

LIGHTS GO RED. HOLD ON THE FACES of our people -- AFRAID,
HEARTS POUNDING as they dread what they're about to see --

Pardon me. But I don't believe you and I
are acquainted.

NERO
... no, we're not. Not yet.
(then)
I would like you to see something.
Spock.

Captain Pike-- your transporter
capability is disabled. You will man a
shuttle and come aboard the Narada for
negotiations. That is all.

The transmission ENDS.   The crew stares in grave anticipation --

KIRK                                SPOCK

ship is a mistake.                   this strategy.

through the Enterprise toward the shuttle bay:

PIKE
Without transporters, we can't beam off
the ship, can't assist Vulcan, can't do
our job. I'm creating an opportunity:
Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and Mr. Olson will
space-jump from the shuttle. You'll have
chutes -- you'll land on that machine
they've lowered into the atmosphere
that's scrambling our gear-- you'll get
inside, disable that thing then beam back
to the ship.

Kirk and Sulu share a HOLY FUCKING SHIT look --

KIRK
... okay.

PIKE
Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you in command of
the ship. Once we have transport
capability and communications back up,
you'll contact Starfleet and report what
the hell's happening here.

PIKE (CONT'D)
Something you've got only precious few
minutes to figure out. If all else
fails, fall back and rendezvous with the
fleet in the Laurentian System.
(Spock is freaked, then)
Kirk. I'm promoting you to First
Officer.


KIRK                               SPOCK
What!?!                           -- Captain?

PIKE (CONT'D)
While I'm gone we need to keep the chain
of command. And you two make a swell
team.

SPOCK
Captain. Please. I apologize, but the
complexities of human pranks escape me.

PIKE
It's not a prank, Spock.   And I'm not the
Captain. You are.

And with that, he's DONE. Strides off.     Kirk finally shakes off
the shock of his PROMOTION --

KIRK
Once we knock out that machine... Sir,
what happens to you?

PIKE
I guess you'll have to come get me.
(turns; to Spock)
Careful with the ship. She's brand new.

They appreciate the pure BALLS of that. BRAVERY washes over
them -- they'd fucking DIE for their Captain, who now turns to
Kirk and Sulu --

PIKE (CONT'D)
Suit up, Gentlemen.

118   EXT. CITY OF VULCANA REGAR - CONTINUOUS                          118

Sarek's hovercraft speeds along the desert floor, arriving at a
massive CAVE OPENING -- he and Amanda hurry off the craft --
into the cave --

68A


118A INT. U.S.S. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONT.  FORMERLY SC. 116          118A

Bridge doors WHOOSH open -- all eyes on Spock as he enters --
their new captain. With cold certainty, he takes the command
chair, hits the intercom:

SPOCK
Dr. Puri, report --

118B INT. MEDICAL BAY - CONTINUOUS                                      118B

CHAOS, UTTER AND COMPLETE. WOUNDED MEN AND WOMEN, it's bad,
bloody -- a HAND hits an intercom: McCoy, badly shaken --

MCCOY
It's McCoy-- Dr. Puri was on Deck 6, he's
dead.

SPOCK
(beat)
Then you have just inherited his
responsibility as Chief Medical Officer.

MCCOY
Aye, Sir.

119   INT. ENTERPRISE - SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS                        119

QUICK CUTS: Kirk, Sulu, and the ship's LEAD ENGINEER OLSON are
suiting up for the drop, strapping on sleek AIRDROP ARMOR. WEB
BELTS. CHUTE PACKS. HARNESSES. HELMETS. COM-SETS.

119A INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                          119A

They race into the shuttle and take seats facing each other
across a narrow aisle -- Red Shirt Engineer GRINS like he's
going on a ski trip:

RED SHIRT ENGINEER
I am pumped to kick some Romulan ass!   No
joke. BRING IT ON!

Kirk nods at him -- subtext: "What a fucking sack."     He looks to
Sulu.

KIRK
So what kinda combat training d'you have?

SULU
(proudly)
Fencing.

KIRK
(unimpressed, beat)
... fencing.

In the COCKPIT, Pike works the controls -- MOTORS WHINE and the
craft LURCHES --

119B INT. ENTERPRISE SHUTTLE HANGAR - NIGHT                             119B

We see the shuttle LEAVE THE DOCK --

120   EXT. IN ORBIT ABOVE VULCAN - CONTINUOUS                           120

The shuttle soars from the Enterprise bay, the planet Vulcan a
red orb below... THRUSTERS FLARE as it descends and now we
REVEAL AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT:

THE NARADA: FROM ITS BELLY, TENTACLE CABLES DESCEND TOWARD THE
PLANET'S OUTER ATMOSPHERE, WHERE THE PLASMA DRILL SUB-STATION IS
TETHERED: THE SOURCE OF THE DRILL BEAM SHOOTING INTO THE PLANET.
The shuttle GLIDES to a hover, 60,000 FEET ABOVE THE DRILL --

121   INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                        121

A KLAXON SOUNDS, signalling depressurization of the cargo lock --
the guys ready their equipment, snatching for handstraps,
standing on the lip of THE AIRLOCK -- Kirk and Sulu meet eyes
through their helmet faceplates, the point of no return --
PIKE'S VOICE over their headsets:

PIKE (V.O.)
Pre-jump on one: Three, two, one.

KIRK, SULU, AND RED SHIRT ARE SLAMMED HARD INTO THE ROOF OF THE
CARGO HOLD AS GRAVITY DIES.

PIKE (CONT'D)
Good luck.

Pike hits another control -- as the shuttle BOMB BAY DOORS OPEN -
- and KIRK, SULU, AND RED SHIRT ARE INSTANTLY PULLED OUT, INTO:

122   EXT. ABOVE VULCAN - CONTINUOUS                                   122

THE THREE MEN IN VIOLENT FREEFALL TOWARD THE PLANET -- IN WILD
SPIN -- THE SENSE OF SPEED'S BEYOND EXHILARATING --

ROCKETING THROUGH THE VOID AT 150 MPH AS THEY BREAK THROUGH THE
PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE -- SHAKING VIOLENTLY AT TERMINAL VELOCITY --

123   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                            123

The falling trio TRACKED ON SCREEN, everyone watches, agape:

CHEKOV
Away team's entering the atmosphere --

SPOCK and UHURA meet eyes -- this is fucking insane -- and a
MAN'S ENTHUSIASTIC YELLING takes us to:

124   EXT. VULCAN'S ATMOSPHERE -- CONTINUOUS                           124

OLSON
WHOOOAAAHYYYEAAAAH!

ONE BY ONE THEY STABILIZE -- FALLING FACE DOWN -- STRAIGHT PAST
THE CABLE TENTACLES TETHERING THE DRILL TO THE NARADA WHICH GIVE
US A SENSE OF INCREDIBLE RELATIVE SPEED AND SCALE -- THESE
MASSIVE CABLES AT DIZZYING SPEED --

THEY ANGLE THEIR HANDS AND FEET FOR CONTROL, GUIDING THEMSELVES
TOWARD THE PLASMA DRILL -- SULU PULLS HIS CHUTE FIRST, THEN KIRK
-- their chutes SNAP OPEN -- JERKING THEM HARD UPWARD AS THE RED
SHIRT BLOWS PAST KIRK AND SULU --

71
124   CONTINUED:                                                     124

KIRK
OLSON, PULL NOW, NOW!!!

HE DEPLOYS HIS CHUTE LAST -- 50 FT -- 40 -- 30 AND HIS CHUTE
BILLOWS OUT, OPENED TOO LATE -- OLSEN'S FUCKING BODY SLAMS INTO
THE EDGE OF THE CIRCULAR DRILL, BOUNCING OFF HARD STEEL AND
RIGHT INTO ITS CENTER WHERE THE SWIRLING VORTEX SPINS -- HE'S
INSTANTLY EVISCERATED IN THE PLASMA LIGHT!

Kirk approaches -- more terrified than ever -- he comes in hard,
too -- SLAMS against the drill edge, bounces but quickly gets
his footing -- hits a button on his chute and SLITS appear in
the fabric, suddenly there's no more drag and THE CHUTE AUTO-
RETRACTS into Kirk's pack -- A REUSABLE PARACHUTE.

BUT SULU ISN'T SO LUCKY: 20 yards from the drill surface his
chute gets SNARED IN THE CABLES, JERKING him upside down -- the
WIND is so intense Sulu is BLOWN SIDEWAYS -- his CHUTE LINES
begin RUBBING on the sharp metal of the suspension rig! Kirk
holds on to one of the chute's cables -- yells up:

KIRK (CONT'D)
I'M COMING FOR YOU!

As Kirk tries to climb up, Sulu's cables begin to SNAP! ONE BY
ONE -- and Sulu tries to CLIMB BACK using his chute cables,
toward the rig -- otherwise he's gonna fly off.

As Kirk makes his way up the rig, suddenly:

SULU
BEHIND YOU!!

Kirk SPINS just as a Romulan appears -- tackling Kirk to the
drill platform! The two FIGHT PRECARIOUSLY ON THE EDGE OF THE
SWIRLING PLASMA DRILL, WIND ROARING -- and suddenly there's
ANOTHER ROMULAN from an OPEN HATCH! SULU SLIDES DOWN THE CABLE -
- JUMPING and tackling the second guard and the shit is ON: our
Starfleet heroes battling these Romulans to the death -- and
Sulu KICKS OFF AN ANTENNA PIECE and uses it as a SABER --
fucking swashbuckling at 10,000 feet! It's a frenzied assault
even the bigger Romulan isn't ready for, and Sulu manages to
KICK him into the vortex, where he's VAPORIZED as --

KIRK draws his PHASER and point-blank SHOOTS the Romulan,
knocking him clear OFF the cylinder and into the sky, falling to
his death, DISINTEGRATING as he falls --

Against pummeling wind, Kirk and Sulu move toward the HATCH --
OPEN IT -- as:

125   OMIT                                                             125

126   INT. NARADA - HANGAR                                            126

Pike's SHUTTLE DOOR OPENS. Pike steps out. Surrounded by a
dozen of Nero's men. Ayel steps forward. Pike stands firm,
knowing this is the end for him:

PIKE
I'm Captain Christopher Pi--

WHACK! He's cut off by a PUNCH to the face. Drops to his
knees. Looks up at Ayel with blazing eyes, wipes a trickle of
blood from his lip:

PIKE (CONT'D)
So much for diplomacy.

He's DRAGGED AWAY as --

127   INT. PLASMA DRILL CYLINDER - CONTINUOUS                         127

Kirk and Sulu DROP IN through the outer hatch to find a control
console, Sulu madly flips switches, no luck --

SULU
None of this is familiar-- the interface,
the controls--

KIRK                              SULU
Step back--                       -- what, you have an idea?
-- yeahyeah, I do--

Kirk FIRES his PHASER at the console, BLASTING IT --

128   EXT. PLASMA DRILL - CONTINUOUS                                  128

The immense column of light DISAPPEARS, leaving only a towering,
swirling vortex of DIRT --

129   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                           129

Uhura's console LIGHTS UP with activity:

UHURA
The jamming signal's gone --
communications are re-established --

CHEKOV
Transporter control re-engaged --

Spock looks up from his console, grave --

73
129   CONTINUED:                                                     129

SPOCK
Chekov, run gravitational sensors -- I
want to know what they're doing to the
planet.

CHEKOV
Aye, Commander-- Keptin, sorry.    Keptin.

130   INT. NARADA - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                              130

A Romulan Helmsman RUNS to Nero --

ROMULAN HELMSMAN
The drill's been sabotaged, Sir.

Nero, mind racing --

NERO
Launch the red matter. Now.

131   EXT. NARADA - SPACE                                            131

The POD we saw earlier is FIRED from the ship -- it WHIPS past.

132   EXT. PLASMA DRILL CYLINDER - CONTINUOUS                        132

Kirk and Sulu pull themselves from the control cockpit back out
onto the drill's outer hull, they start to hear a SOUND... A
HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEK... GETTING LOUDER AS IT FALLS TOWARD THEM...
THEY LOOK UP JUST IN TIME TO SEE: THE RED MATTER POD RIP RIGHT
PAST THEM -- SNAP-TILT DOWN WITH IT AS IT PLUMMETS TOWARD
VULCAN'S SURFACE, DISAPPEARING INTO THE DRILLED GAPING HOLE --

And for an instant... nothing. What looks like a puff of smoke
billowing up from the planet's core... THEN A SHOCKWAVE BLASTS
UPWARD, ALL THE WAY UP TO THE DRILL AT 10,000 FEET -- KIRK AND
SULU FEEL IT -- LOSE THEIR BALANCE, FIGHT FOR PURCHASE AS:

KIRK
Kirk to Enterprise -- they just launched
something toward the planet!

133   EXT. VULCAN SURFACE - CONTINUOUS                               133

SCENES OF DESTRUCTION ACROSS THE PLANET AS IT STARTS TO COME

CHEKOV
Keptin: gravitational sensors are off the
scale -- if my calculations are correct,
that pod they launched is creating a
singularity... that will consume the
planet.

SPOCK'S STOIC FACE. WE GET ONLY A HINT OF THE WILD EMOTIONS
STIRRING INSIDE HIM -- Uhura watches Spock, heartsick for him:

SPOCK
They're creating a black hole... at the
center of Vulcan?

CHEKOV
... yessir.

SPOCK
How long does the planet have?

CHEKOV
... minutes, Sir. I'd say minutes.

SPOCK
(beat, to Uhura)
Alert Vulcan Command Center to signal a
planetwide evacuation-- all channels, all
frequencies -- maintain standard orbit --

UHURA
What?   Spock, wait --

She goes after him as he moves to the TURBOLIFT --

UHURA (CONT'D)
-- where are you going?

SPOCK
To evacuate the Vulcan High Council--
they're tasked with protecting our
cultural history. My parents will be
among them--

UHURA
-- you can't beam them out?

SPOCK
It's not possible -- they'll be in the
Katrik Arc, I must get them myself--

TURBOLIFT DOORS CLOSE AS --

135   INT. NARADA - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                                135

HOLOGRAMS of VULCAN UNDER DESTRUCTION -- Nero watching them,

NERO
Retract the drill, let's move out!

The drill platform LURCHES -- begins RETRACTING --

136   EXT. PLASMA DRILL CYLINDER - CONTINUOUS                          136

The platform BANKS -- Sulu FALLS BACK, OFF THE PLATFORM --
WITHOUT A CHUTE! Kirk, holding on, watching this wide-eyed --
and knowing what he must do, he RUNS AND JUMPS --

KIRK FALLS FAST, he's only gonna have one shot at this, presses
his arms to his sides and ROCKETS downward, building speed, four
hundred feet below is Sulu, FREEFALLING --

KIRK moves his feet and hands, angling toward him -- slashing
downward at 160 mph, closing like a missile -- the gap between
them narrows -- Sulu's 30 feet below him... 5000 feet to the
planet surface. 40 ft -- 20 -- 10 -- WHAM! Kirk slams into
Sulu in a mid-air tackle -- they TUMBLE TOGETHER -- Kirk's made
the grab and locked his arms around Sulu in an iron grip,
screams in his face:

KIRK
I GOTCHA!   NOW PULL MY CHUTE!

Sulu DOES -- it opens -- but HOLY FUCK, the double weight RIPS
IT -- IT SNAPS AWAY FROM THEM -- NOW THEY'RE BOTH FREE-FALLING
WITH NO CHUTE, THE GROUND COMING AT THEM FAST!

KIRK (CONT'D)
ENTERPRISE, WE'RE FALLING WITHOUT A
CHUTE!!! BEAM US UP!!! BEAM US UP!!!

136A INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER BAY                               136A

The TRANSPORTER CHIEF works his controls, sweating -- trying to
LOCK ON TO THEIR MOVING TARGET --

TRANSPORTER CHIEF
I'm trying!   I can't lock on your signal!

137   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                            137

TRANSPORTER CHIEF (V.O.)
-- you're moving too fast!

CHEVOK
-- no-- I can do that-- I CAN DO THAT!!!

Chekov suddenly BOLTS -- Uhura watches him race off -- a CREW
MEMBER steps into frame:

CREW MEMBER
The black hole's expanding, we won't
reach minimum safe distance if we don't
leave immediately!

137A INT. ENTERPRISE - VARIOUS AREAS                                    137A

Chekov SPRINTS through CORRIDORS -- ENGINE ROOM -- YELLING:

CHEKOV
MOVE!   I CAN DO THAT!   I CAN DO THAT!!!

And we take him to:

137B INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER BAY                                  137B

CHEKOV
I CAN LOCK ON!     GIMME MANUAL CONTROL!
QUICK!!!

137C EXT. SKIES ABOVE VULCAN PLANET SURFACE - DAY                       137C

Kirk and Sulu SPEED-DROPPING -- TERRIFIED --

137D INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER BAY                                  137D

Chekov's manipulating a joystick-like TARGETING DISPLAY --

5 FEET BEFORE THEY HIT THE GROUND, KIRK AND SULU DEMATERIALIZE!

141   INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER BAY - CONTINUOUS                    141

AND REMATERIALIZE, SLAMMING DOWN ON THE TRANSPORTER PADS, HARD
AND PAINFUL, BUT SAFE! Transporter engineers GAPE in utter
amazement and relief -- Chekov, sweating, laughs. Kirk and Sulu
get their bearings, peeling themselves up, at stunned whispers:

SULU
... thanks.

KIRK
... yeah, not a problem.

And Kirk looks up as SPOCK hurries in --

SPOCK
Step aside -- I'm going to the surface.

As the console ENGINEER works the display --

KIRK
The surface of what? YOU'RE GOING DOWN
THERE? Are you nuts?!

SPOCK
Energize --

And Spock DEMATERIALIZES --

142   EXT. VULCAN - DAY                                                 142

PUSH IN as Spock MATERIALIZES -- the distant landscape around
him COLLAPSING, IMPLODING, EXPLODING -- he sprints for the
MOUNTAIN -- the entrance to the ARK -- a scared, small CREATURE
runs past Spock as he heads up the mountain -- rocks falling --

143   INT. KATRIC ARK CHAMBER - DAY                                   143

Spock RACES through the tunnels as the world SHAKES around him --
he enters the massive ARK CHAMBER -- sees, atop the enormous
stairs, FIVE VULCAN ELDERS, Sarek among them, hands placed on
the sarcophagus-like ark. Mind melding with it. Amanda is here
too, kneeling beside Sarek -- and she sees her son, who is now
RUNNING toward them -- she stands:

AMANDA
Spock--!

Spock rushes up the stairs --

SPOCK
The planet's not safe, it has only
seconds left -- we must evacuate now --

And as they run out, ENORMOUS ROCKS COLLAPSE AROUND THEM -- and
they run through the tunnels, the STONE COLLAPSING AROUND THEM --

144   EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - DAY                                      144

Spock and the group finally emerge from the tunnels to see --
THE PLANET IS COLLAPSING, COMING TOWARD THEM -- Spock whips
open a tri-corder, TREMBLING LIKE CRAZY --

SPOCK
Spock to Enterprise: take us back now!

HORROR AS THE WORLD LITERALLY STARTS TO FALL APART AROUND SPOCK,
HIS PARENTS AND THE FIVE ELDERS -- MASSIVE SINKHOLES APPEARING,
LIKE THE GRAND CANYON RACING FOR THEM -- AND WE SEE IN ALL THEIR
FACES -- THE BELIEF THAT THEIR PLANET -- THAT THEY -- ARE GOING
TO DIE -- and Spock, trying to hold it together -- even though
their transport hasn't yet begun -- looks at Amanda -- their
eyes lock -- THE COLLAPSING GROUND RACING TOWARD THEM -- and in
a surreal, intimate moment, Amanda says to Spock, quietly:

AMANDA
It's okay.   To be scared.

79
146   CONTINUED:                                                     146

PUSH IN ON SPOCK, looking at her -- as the LIGHT DARTS start
TRACING THEM -- and they begin to EVAPORATE AS THE GROUND DROPS
FROM UNDER AMANDA -- AND SHE'S SUCKED DOWN -- AWAY -- as Spock
REACHES FOR HER, CALLING OUT --

SPOCK
MOTHER!!!!

147   INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER BAY - CONTINUOUS                   147

Chekov in a panic at the controls --

CHEKOV
NO!!!   I'M LOSING HER!!!

-- as the Vulcans MATERIALIZE on the pad, Spock still REACHING
for his mother -- but all he gets it the GHOSTLY IMAGE OF HER --
BEAUTIFUL, HOLDING, FROZEN IN SPACE -- AN IMAGE HE'LL BE HAUNTED
BY FOREVER -- AS IT FADES AWAY, EVANESCING LIKE MIST -- ON SPOCK
as it lands -- Sarek too... a mother... a wife... has been lost.
And Kirk stands nearby, having observed all of this, without
anything to do or say... there's no cheating death.

148   EXT. SPACE - ETERNAL NIGHT                                       148

And the Enterprise BLASTS AWAY -- in the distance, THE ENTIRE
PLANET OF VULCAN SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF -- A TERRIFYING,
UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION -- UNTIL NOTHING IS THERE BUT DARKNESS.
And over this we HEAR:

SPOCK (V.O.)
Acting Captain's log. Stardate 2256.42:
I have assumed command of the Enterprise.

149-50 MIT
O                                                           149-50

151   INT. ENTERPRISE - SICK BAY - CONTINUOUS                          151

SHOCK. The kind that crashes after the world's changed. In
triage, the bay's filled with wounded Enterprise Officers. The
Vulcan Elders and Sarek being examined as well. Kirk sits here,
getting his hand bandaged from the fight. During this, he looks
up, seeing one of the Elders being treated for a slight wound --
her GREEN BLOOD seen through the bandage...

SPOCK (V.O.)
We've heard no word from Captain Pike. I
have therefore classified him a hostage

151A INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE                                          151A

Spock sits in the captain's chair, reporting. He's glassy-eyed,
staring at nothing as he speaks. Behind him, Uhura sits,
watching, concerned.

SPOCK
Nero, who has destroyed my home planet.
And most of its six billion inhabitants.
I estimate no more than ten thousand
survived.
(beat)
While the essence of our culture has been
saved, in the elders who now reside upon
this ship... I am now a member of an
endangered species.

Spock considers this. Clicks off the log recorder.     Spock moves
off, into the turbolift -- Uhura follows him --

152   INT. TURBOLIFT - CONTINUOUS                                      152

Spock and Uhura. Silence hangs. She glances over, wanting to
say so much, but not to invade what must be the worst moment of
his life. He looks at her, with kind eyes. And Uhura does
something odd -- she STOPS the lift. Spock looks over as she
wordlessly reaches out and puts her arms around him. Just
holding him. Kissing his face with utter tenderness and
comfort, which he lets her do... and we realize, this is why the
intimacy before -- this is their secret...

UHURA
I'm so sorry.

Spock looks off, taking comfort, bewildered and lost...

UHURA (CONT'D)
What can I do?     Tell me what you need.

SPOCK
... I need...

He's on the verge of some emotional release... but self-
consciousness returns and he clamps up, starting the lift again:

SPOCK (CONT'D)
I need for us all to continue performing
admirably.

He looks at her again -- gives her another kiss. The door opens
and he exits. She watches him go -- and the door closes on her.

152A INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR                                        152A

Kirk comes down the hall, stretching his hand bandage -- when he
stops. Standing at the other end of the corridor, operating a
DATAPAD is a familiar-looking GREEN GIRL. Guilt overcomes him.
After a beat he moves to her. Awkward.

KIRK
Hey.
(she turns to him)
Listen, about what happened at Starfleet.
The test and everything-- I know it looks
like I was... using you, or whatever.
And I'm sorry. I really am. And... I
just hope you'll forgive me.

She just stares at him for a long beat, as if she's just pissed.
But Kirk's face changes... and then he says:

KIRK (CONT'D)
... you're not Gaila, are you?

NOT GAILA
(pissed)
No.

KIRK
(nods)
Sorry.

And he walks off.   (NOTE: ALT. VERSION HAS GAILA SAYING, "I'M
NOT GAILA.")

153   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                            153

Uhura at her station, scanning for enemy signals -- all of our
principals are here, in debate:

SPOCK
Lieutenant, have you confirmed that Nero
is headed for Earth?

UHURA
Their trajectory suggests no other
destination, Captain.

KIRK
Earth may be his next stop, but we have
to assume every Federation planet's a
target.

CHEKOV
Yes, agreed-- but why didn't they destroy
us?

82
153   CONTINUED:                                                        153

SULU
Why waste a weapon?      We weren't a threat.

SPOCK
That's not it.     He said he wanted me to
see something.     The destruction of my
home planet.

MCCOY
And how the hell did they do that by the
way? When did they jump so far ahead in
the arms race?

SPOCK
The engineering comprehension necessary
to artificially create a black hole may
suggest the answer: such technology could
theoretically be manipulated to create a
tunnel through space time.

MCCOY
Damnit, man, I'm a doctor, not a
physicist -- are you suggesting they're
from the future?

KIRK
That is what he's suggesting and I don't
buy it.

SPOCK
If you eliminate the impossible, whatever
remains -- however improbable -- must be
the truth.

MCCOY
How poetic.

KIRK
Then what would an angry future Romulan
want with Captain Pike?

SULU
As Admiral he knows details of
Starfleet's defenses.

KIRK
What we need to do is catch up to that
ship. Disable it, take it over and get
Pike back.

They're all looking at Kirk like he's nuts.

Fantastic, I'm in.

SPOCK
Captain Pike left us with standing orders
to rendezvous with the fleet on the other
side of the quadrant.

SPOCK (CONT'D)
We're technologically outmatched in every
way. A rescue attempt would be
illogical.

KIRK
"Illogical"-- you're funny.

CHEKOV
Not to mention we couldn't do it anyway:
Nero's ship would have to drop out of
warp for us to overtake them --

KIRK
-- what about assigning Engineering crews
to try and boost our warp yield?

SPOCK                              KIRK
Remaining power and crew are
being used to repair radiation
leaks on the lower decks and
damage to the main deflector
shield-- without which we
cannot communicate with          -- okay--okay, okayokayokay--
Starfleet.                       there's gotta be SOME WAY!

SPOCK
We must gather with the rest of Starfleet
to balance the terms of our next
engagement --

KIRK
There won't be a next engagement, Spock:
by the time we've "gathered", it'll be
too late -- how many planets are you
willing to risk? You say he's from the
future? Knows what's gonna happen? Then
the logical thing is to be unpredictable.

SPOCK
You're assuming Nero knows how events are
predicted to unfold. The contrary:
Nero's very presence has altered the flow
of history, beginning with the attack on
the U.S.S. Kelvin, culminating in the
events of today -- thereby creating a new
chain of incidents that cannot be
anticipated by either party.

MCCOY
Does anyone understand him?

UHURA
(stunned)
... an alternate reality.

SPOCK
Precisely. Whatever lives we might have
lived, if the time continuum was
disrupted... our destinies have changed.

Mr. Sulu, plot a course for the
Laurentian system, Warp Factor Three--



KIRK                               SPOCK

For a beat, nobody moves -- an impossible choice for all of
them. Torn, Chekov and Sulu close in on Kirk --

SULU
I'm sorry.

KIRK
Yeah, don't worry ab --

I only have one for you. I need the

those surrounding Earth.

Pike looks up at him -- quiet rage.   Then --

PIKE
Christopher Pike -- Captain, U.S.S.
Enterprise, registry NCC-1701.

NERO
Christopher.
(beat; hardcore)
Answer my question.

PIKE
No. You answer for the genocide you just
committed on a peaceful planet--

NERO
I prevented genocide.
(beat, calms)
Where I come from, Christopher... this
ship is just a mining vessel. I chose a
life of honest labor to provide for
myself... and the wife who was carrying
my child.
(beat)
I sit here now... knowing you as enemies.
Not just of today. But of tomorrow. I
watched as your Federation did nothing.
They let us burn to death... as our
planet broke in half.

Curiosity behind Pike's eyes.

PIKE
Then Nero, you're confused. Romulus has
not been destroyed. How can you blame
the Federation for something that hasn't
happened--?

NERO
It did happen. I remember it. I... felt
it.
(then; pained)
When I lost her... I promised myself I
would not speak another word until the
day of my retribution. In twenty five
years I forgot the sound of my own
voice... but I didn't forget the pain.
That feeling cannot be erased.

(turning to anger now)
A feeling that every surviving Vulcan now

Pike just looks at him.   Sees how fucking far GONE he is.

PIKE
If what you say is true... you can save
Romulus. You have a second chance to --

NERO
-- yes, which is a gift I won't waste on
mercy.
(beat)
My purpose, Christopher, is not simply to
avoid the destruction of the home I
love...
(beat)
... but to create a Romulus which exists,
free of the Federation. Only then will
she be saved.

And the "she" could refer to the planet... or to Nero's lost
love. Either way, Pike knows a losing battle when he's fighting
one. Ever so nobly, he quietly says --

PIKE
Then we have nothing more to discuss.

Nero reaches for something under the counter Pike lies upon.
Retrieves A FAMILIAR GLASS CONTAINER -- inside -- DOZENS OF
CENTAURIAN SLUGS, the very ones used on Nero.

NERO
It's not the fault of the human race that
Starfleet chose Earth as its center.
You're a more noble race than my fallen
cousins. I'll take no pleasure in your
extinction.

PIKE
How reassuring.

Nero opens the container, reaches for a pair of TONGS

NERO
The frequencies, please.

PIKE
Christopher Pike -- Captain, U.S.S.
Enterprise, registry NCC-1701.

Nero sad-smiles.   What he expected.

Our POV is BLURRY. We come into FOCUS on a blinking instrument
panel. KIRK is stirring awake, his shoulder kills. He sits up:
inside a ONE-MAN POD CRAFT. He WIPES THE GLASS -- looks up --
like a TUNNEL OF SNOW, 30 feet long, to the sky. THE PODCRAFT'S
EMBEDDED ON THE SURFACE OF A VAST, ICE PLANET. Kirk's been
MAROONED. He closes his eyes, his face falls...

KIRK
Computer...    where am I?

COMPUTER VOICE
Current location Delta Vega: Class "M"
Planet, unsafe. You have been ordered to
remain in your pod until retrieved by
Starfleet authorities.

KIRK
Bite me, how's that.

The CANOPY RISES -- a blast of cold air hits Kirk -- with some
agony, out he goes -- he CLIMBS UP THE TUBE OF SNOW -- and gets
to the surface -- looks out. HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF FUCKING
NOWHERE. Finally:

159   EXT. DELTA VEGA - PLANET SURFACE - CONTINUOUS                    159

Kirk FREEZES at a nearby GROWL. He looks -- sees nothing --
then ANOTHER GROWL -- he turns -- some thirty feet away, an
eleven foot-tall cross between a polar bear and a gorilla (it's
a POLARILLA) steps out from behind a mass of ice. Sees Kirk.
It's horrifying. Kirk takes a SLOW, SMALL STEP BACKWARD -- and
the fucking thing CHARGES HIM -- KIRK RUNS, TERRIFIED -- and the
POLARILLA PURSUES -- gaining -- it's gonna EAT HIM ALIVE WHEN
SUDDENLY --

WHATEVER WAS BENEATH THE ICE EARLIER EXPLODES UP THROUGH IT --
IT'S NEARLY 30 FEET TALL, RED, HUNDREDS OF EYES -- IT SMACKS THE
POLARILLA AWAY LIKE NOTHING AS KIRK FALLS TO THE ICE AND TURNS
BACK -- HOLY SHIT! THIS THING IS SO MUCH WORSE! IT ROARS AS
KIRK GETS TO HIS FEET AND RUNS, SCREAMING --

KIRK HAULS ASS AS THE THING COMES AFTER HIM -- THEN SUDDENLY HE
FALLS -- DROPS -- and we see that Kirk is FALLING DOWN A MASSIVE
SNOW MOUNTAIN! The huge red creature stops at the edge and
ROARS LOUDLY -- until the ice shelf BREAKS AWAY! The creature
starts to FALL AS WELL! Now Kirk is TUMBLING, the immense
creature TUMBLING not far behind!

And Kirk LANDS ON THE ICE, HARD -- sees a distant CAVE. Looks
up at the FLAILING CREATURE that is about to CRUSH HIM -- Kirk
tries to run, but the ice is TOO SLIPPERY -- FINALLY he gets
footing and runs off toward the cave -- as the red creature
LANDS HARD -- its sharp SPEAR LIMBS STAB into the ice as it
pursues Kirk --

Kirk races through the darkened cave -- the creature comes
after him -- Kirk goes as fast as he can -- the creature reaches
out and fucking GRABS HIM -- pulls him toward the disgusting,
wet, TEETHY MOUTH -- Kirk tries to hold on to anything he can --
but he's fucking LUNCH -- and just as you're SCREAMING, there's
LIGHT -- FIRE LIGHT -- and a FIGURE APPEARS, WAVING A TORCH --

And the red creature's eyes ALL GO WILD -- and it DROPS KIRK and
BACKS OFF, AFRAID -- the figure CHASES IT until it's gone.
Kirk, on the ground, is freaked out, out of breath, and can't
take his eyes off this man... who says:

And the Figure turns... we may have recognized the voice.
IT'S SPOCK. As in NIMOY. HERE. Lit in the darkness by the
fire. We'll refer to him as SPOCK PRIME. He looks at Kirk --
moves closer to him -- finally seeing him. And is amazed...

KIRK
Hey... thank you...

SPOCK PRIME
... Jim?

KIRK
(stunned)
-- how d'you know my name?

SPOCK PRIME
How did you find me--? Does Starfleet
know of my presence?

KIRK
HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?

Spock looks deep into the eyes of the freaked out young man,
feeling the full effect of fate playing its hand, but realizing
he doesn't recognize him...

SPOCK PRIME
I have been... and always shall be...
your friend.

KIRK
-- no, I don't know you -- the only
Vulcan I know isn't exactly a buddy.

Of all the things Spock predicted Kirk might say, it wasn't
that. He's analyzing a thousand steps ahead, calculating:

SPOCK PRIME
You are James T. Kirk. Your father is
George, as is your brother. Your
mother's name is Winona -- you were born
in 2233 --

KIRK
Stop.   Please.     I don't understand.

As Spock nods, we PRE-LAP:

the ice walls. Remarkable NIGHT STARS outside.

SPOCK PRIME
It's remarkably pleasing to see you
again.

KIRK
Old friend. Sir, I don't have any idea
how you know what you know. But I don't
know you and if you are Spock we're not
friends. You hate me. You marooned me
here for mutiny...

SPOCK PRIME
Mutiny?   You are not the Captain?

Our minds... one and together...One
hundred and twenty-seven years from now
everything ends.

Spock's eyes SNAP SHUT, Kirk JOLTS as if by an electric charge --

A SUPERNOVA. An EXPLODING STAR, like a LIGHT, EATING AWAY AT

SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
A star in Beta Quadrant will go supernova

will grow... and destroy everything.

162A INT. VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY                                     162A

Now we're seeing VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY -- where SIX VULCAN
SCIENTISTS study a HOLOGRAM of this event -- the star's ORIGIN,
its PATH OF DESTRUCTION -- and SPOCK PRIME is among them --

I saw the beginning of it myself. Vulcan
Science Academy devised a plan to stop
it.

SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
I agreed to pilot the ship. Knowing I
would not return.

Kamikaze pilot. Tea, sipped inside the Ark --

My sacrifice, in service of all races,
seemed only logical.

Now Spock Prime sits in the Jellyfish COCKPIT --

PRIME'S HAND AGAIN:

KIRK
Nero's planet was destroyed--

SPOCK PRIME
Yes. He of course blamed us. Believed
Vulcan allowed his planet to die. Which
was hardly the case. Let me continue.

KIRK                           SPOCK PRIME
This annoys me, I don't like      -- I know, I know, I'm not
it-- do we have to do it like     surprised to hear you complain
this--?                           -- allow me to finish.

MASSIVE SUPERNOVA in the infinite distance -- no sense of scale
here -- but then -- THE NARADA APPEARS -- FIRES TORPEDOES at the
Jellyfish.

SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
Nero came after me. Determined to thwart
my mission. If Romulus was allowed to
die, he said... all planets should share
its fate.

167A SPOCK PRIME IN THE COCKPIT, ROCKED AS TORPEDOES EXPLODE         167A
CLOSELY. TIGHT ON SPOCK PRIME AS HIS MIND RACES --

SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
I needed an exit. I knew if this mission
failed... everyone, everywhere... would
lose everything.

Spock Prime LEAVES the cockpit --

167B INT. JELLYFISH - CONTAINMENT HOLD                               167B

Prime ENTERS AN AIRLOCK -- TUMBLES IN WEIGHTLESSNESS and enters
THE CONTAINMENT ROOM. QUICK CUTS as he REMOVES RED MATTER FROM
THE HOLD --

SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
I realized: a large black hole could
destroy the supernova. A smaller one...
could be my escape. Could send me back
in time, allowing me to complete my
mission. So I created a black hole...

Spock loads the CANNISTER with a small amount of RED MATTER into
a JETTISON TUBE --

167C EXT. JELLYFISH - SPACE - NIGHT                                  167C

SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
Nero must have understood what I was
trying to do. Because he began racing
for it.

The NARADA and the JELLYFISH aiming for the BLACK HOLE --

167F OMIT                                                             167F

167G INT. JELLYFISH - COCKPIT - NIGHT                                 167G

Spock Prime watches as the NARADA GOES IN -- LIGHTNING STORM-
STYLE DISAPPEARING FIRST -- then SPOCK PRIME'S FACE -- WHITE
WITH LIGHTNING -- OVEREXPOSED --

SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
Nero simply got to it first. How long I
was travelling... I couldn't tell you.
It was timeless. But when I arrived...

LIGHT on Spock Prime's face goes away -- he and the Jellyfish
are back in SPACE --

168-9 OMIT                                                          168-9

SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
Nero was waiting for me.

KIRK INHALES, SHARPLY, having been there with Spock Prime.    Back
to the two men, in a cave:

Kirk stares at him... his mind spinning because now he
believes him. The result is overwhelmingly emotional.

SPOCK PRIME
Forgive me... emotional transference is
an effect of the mind meld.

95
174   CONTINUED:                                                    174

KIRK
(sympathy, surprise)
... so you do feel...

SPOCK PRIME
"Cthia" is the stricture that binds our
emotions... but few of us are that
perfectly Vulcan.

Kirk gathers himself, wipes his eyes on his sleeve...

KIRK
Going back in time... you changed all our
lives.

SPOCK PRIME
Yet remarkably, events within our
timelines, characteristics, people...
seem to overlap significantly. Tell me
about the rest of the crew? Chekov--
Uhura --?

KIRK
Tactical and Communications --

SPOCK PRIME
-- Sulu --

KIRK
-- he's the helmsman, why?

SPOCK PRIME
Dr. McCoy would assert our meeting here
is not a matter of coincidence... but
rather, indication of a higher purpose.

KIRK
... he'd call it a damn miracle.

SPOCK PRIME
Yes he would. Perhaps the time stream's
way of attempting to mend itself. In
both our histories, the same crew found
its way onto the same ship in a time of
ultimate crisis -- therein lies our
advantage.
(rises)
We must go-- there's a Starfleet outpost
not far from here.

But Kirk stands -- stops him:

96
174   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 174

KIRK
Where you came from... did I know my
father?

SPOCK PRIME
... yes. You often spoke of him as your
inspiration for joining starfleet.

This is amazing for Kirk -- he looks off, trying to imagine that
life. Spock intuits what this means.

SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
You should know. He proudly lived to see
you become captain of the Enterprise.

KIRK
... Captain?

SPOCK PRIME
A ship we must return you to as soon as
possible.

174A EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                         174A

The Enterprise STREAKS through frame in a warp blur --

Sulu at his controls:

SULU
Warp three. Course one-five-one mark
three, the Laurentian System.

The turbolift opens -- McCoy enters, moves to Spock:

MCCOY
You wanted to see me?

SPOCK
(discreet tone)
Yes, Doctor. I'm aware that James Kirk
is a friend of yours. Supporting me, as
you did, must have been difficult.

MCCOY
... are you thanking me?

SPOCK
I'm simply acknowledging your
difficulties.

We're not sure how McCoy is taking this...

97
174B CONTINUED:                                                       174B

MCCOY
Permission to speak freely, Sir.

SPOCK
I welcome it.

MCCOY
Do you. Okay then: are you out of your
Vulcan mind? Were you doing the logical
thing? Maybe. The right one?
Debatable. But one thing's for damn sure
-- that kid doesn't know how to lose.
Just isn't in his DNA. Back home we have
a saying: "If you're gonna ride in the
Kentucky Derby, don't leave your prize
stallion in the stable."

SPOCK
... a curious metaphor, Doctor. As a
stallion must first be broken before it
can reach its potential.

MCCOY
My God, Man... you could at least act
like it was a hard decision.

SPOCK
I intended to assist in the effort to re-
establish communication with Starfleet.
However, if crew morale would be better
served by my roaming the halls weeping,
I'll gladly defer to your medical
expertise.

A strong look and Spock turns away as Sarek enters the bridge.
Spock moves to meet him. Off McCoy, fuming --

174C EXT. DELTA VEGA - PLANET SURFACE - DAY                           174C

A fucking BLIZZARD.   Kirk and Spock Prime move through the
maddening whiteout.   Kirk yells through it:

KIRK
I AM SO PISSED OFF AT THE OTHER YOU RIGHT
NOW!

And Spock POINTS -- an OUTPOST -- half a mile away.

175   INT. STARFLEET OUTPOST - DAY                                     175

Long tile corridor. The door at the end opens -- SNOW AND WIND
as Kirk and Spock Prime enter. Door closes. Silence again.

98
175   CONTINUED:                                                        175

KIRK
... hello?!

Echo. Nothing. They head down. After a beat, a SMALL, DARK,
ODDLY ALIEN CREATURE STEPS OUT. Eyes them curiously. This is
KEENSER.

KEENSER
... can I help you?

SPOCK PRIME
Are you the station chief?

Keenser looks them over.    Then:

KEENSER
... no.   This way.

And they follow Keenser into a MASSIVE WAREHOUSE, filled mostly
with junked space parts. A large, tarped SHUTTLE in the
background. In the middle of the huge, depressing space is a
table. And a STARFLEET OFFICER who is ASLEEP, legs kicked up,
leaning back in a chair, a hat covering his face. Keenser taps
the Officer's boot.

STARFLEET OFFICER
Hm.

KEENSER
Visitors.

A beat -- and the Officer peers from under his hat.     A cool,
slow burn.

STARFLEET OFFICER
You realize how unacceptable this is.

KIRK
Excuse me?

SPOCK PRIME
(re: the Officer)
... Fascinating.

KIRK
What?

Officer stands, unhappy about something. Keeser watches nearby --

STARFLEET OFFICER
I'm sure it's no' your fault, and I know
youse lads are just doing your jobs, but
could you no' have come a wee bit
sooner?!
(MORE)

99
175   CONTINUED: (2)                                              175
STARFLEET OFFICER (CONT'D)
Six months I've been living on nothing
but Starfleet Protein Nibs and the
promise of a real food delivery! Six
months, boys! It's pretty clear what's
going on here, isn't it? Punishment!
Ongoing! For something that was clearly
an accident!

SPOCK PRIME
You're Montgomery Scott.

KIRK
You know him?

SCOTTY
Yes, that's me -- Scotty-- you're in the
right place-- are there any other hard-
working and equally-starving Starfleet
officers around?

KEENSER
Me.

SCOTTY
You eat nothing. A bean and you're done
for a week, I need food. And now you're
here -- so. Thank you. Where is it.

SPOCK PRIME
You are in fact the Mr. Scott who
postulated the theory of trans-warp
beaming.

SCOTTY
Yes! That's exactly what I'm talking
about! How d'ya think I ended up here?
I got into a debate with my instructor on
the issue of Relativistic Physics as they
pertain to subspace travel... He seemed
to think that the range of transporting
say, a roast turkey, was limited to a few
hundred miles -- so I told my instructor
I could not only beam a bird from one
planet to an adjacent planet in the same
system -- which is no big deal anyway --
but if I were so inclined I could
actually do it with a lifeform! So I
tested it on Admiral Archer's prize
beagle. Which... was a mistake.

KIRK
I know that dog. What happened to it?

100
175   CONTINUED: (3)                                                   175

SCOTTY
I'll tell ya when it reappears.     Dunno.
Feel guilty.

SPOCK PRIME
What if I told you your trans-warp theory
was correct? That it is indeed possible
to beam onto a ship that is travelling at
warp speed. And that you only required
the correct field equation to
recrystallize dilithium?

SCOTTY
I haven't been stationed here that long.
If such an equation had been discovered,
I'da heard.

SPOCK PRIME
The reason you haven't heard of it, Mr.
Scott... is because you haven't
discovered it yet.

Kirk reacts. Scotty reacts -- is almost spooked -- sobers up a
bit... really regards Spock Prime. Skeptical. Amused.

SCOTTY
Y'from the future, are ya? Brilliant.
D'they still have sandwiches where you're
from? Piece and jam? Mince 'n tatties?
Cockaleekie soup?

KIRK
What is he talking about?

KEENSER
Food.

SPOCK PRIME
Allow us access to your shuttle... and I
will show you what a genius you actually
are.

Off Scotty, who can't help but be intrigued --

176   OMIT                                                             176

177   EXT. INT. SCOTTY'S SHUTTLE - TRANSPORTER PAD - MOMENTS LATER     177

Scotty PULLS A TARP over much of the out-of-service shuttle.

SCOTTY
She's a wee bit dodgy: shield emitters
are totally banjaxed, along wi' a few
other things.

101
177   CONTINUED:                                                      177

Spock finishes speed-typing the FIELD EQUATIONS on the
TRANSPORTER CONTROL PANEL -- amazingly fast.

SCOTTY (CONT'D)
... rapid.   That's impressive.

Spock Prime steps aside:

SPOCK PRIME
Your equation for achieving trans-warp
beaming.

Scotty looks at the equations -- we watch his expression run the
gamut: from confused, to dumbfounded, to quiet awe and delight:

SCOTTY
Imagine that! Never occurred to me to
think of space as the part that's moving.

SPOCK PRIME
Point of fact: it did occur to you.
(he works the console)
Extrapolating Enterprise's course --

SCOTTY
-- Enterprise? Had its maiden voyage
already, has it? Well, you must've done
something right to be assigned to that
ship, Kiddo. She's a well endowed lady --
love to get my hands on her ample
nacelles, if you'll pardon the
engineering parlance.

SPOCK PRIME
Now's your chance, Mr. Scott.

SCOTTY
Look, even if I believed you -- where
you're from, what I've done-- which I
don't -- we're still talkin' bout
slingshotting aboard while she's going
faster than light. Without a proper
receiving pad, that's like tryin'a hit a
bullet with a smaller bullet, wearing a
blindfold. On a horse.

SPOCK
I calculate no more than a four meter
margin of error.

SCOTTY
That's all well and good unless you
rematerialize four meters outside the
ship.

102
177   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  177

As Spock works the keyboard, an ENTERPRISE SCHEMATIC rotates:

SPOCK PRIME
Agreed: the aft engineering bay is your
best option: a large space and no
unpredictable airlocks --

KIRK
-- you're coming with us, right?

SPOCK PRIME
No, Jim. My destiny lies along a
different path.

KIRK                          SPOCK PRIME
Your destiny can wait -- he         (simply, strong)
won't believe me, only you can   Under no circumstances can he
explain w--                      be made aware of my existence.
You must promise me this.

KIRK
You're telling me I can't tell you I'm
following your own orders? Why not?
What happens?

SPOCK PRIME
Trust me. Above all. Jim, this is the
one rule you cannot break. To stop Nero,
you alone must take command of your ship.

KIRK
How, over your dead body?

SPOCK PRIME
Preferably not. There is, however,
Starfleet Regulation 619.
(off Kirk's confusion)
Yes. I forget what little regard you had
for such things. 619 states that any
commanding officer who is emotionally
compromised by the mission at hand...
must resign said command.

KIRK
So I need to emotionally compromise you?

SPOCK PRIME
Jim.  I just lost my planet. I can tell
you.  I am emotionally compromised.
(then)
What you must do... is get me to show it.

PUSHING IN ON KIRK as this lands for him --

103
177   CONTINUED: (3)                                                  177

KIRK
Hm.

SCOTTY
Aye, then. Live or die, Laddie, let's
get this over with. he Enterprise has a
decent cafeteria I'm guessing.

Scotty's on the pad.   Kirk follows, looks at Spock:

KIRK
You know... coming back in time...
changing history... that's cheating.

SPOCK PRIME
A trick I learned from an old friend.

Something strikes Kirk -- his eyes GLINT with revelation. Spock
responds enigmatically: a silent acknowledgment of what Kirk
must do to get the ship. He raises his hand in the legendary
Vulcan salute:

SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
Live long, and prosper.

And Spock activates the transporter and they DEMATERIALIZE --
the light plays off his face as he watches them vanish --

178   EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                         178

The Enterprise SHOOTS THROUGH FRAME at warp --

179   INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING BAY - CONTINUOUS                  179

Amid the ROAR of the ship's plasma drives, PARTICLES
rematerialize... it's KIRK, eyes wide in suspense. He looks
down at his legs, his chest, his arms to make sure he's still in
one piece, glances over to share his relief with Scotty... BUT
SCOTTY ISN'T THERE. A strange BANGING -- Kirk turns: the
BANGING is coming from a large metal TANK -- then Scotty appears
in a TRANSLUCENT PIPE -- FREAKING OUT -- BANGING ON THE CLEAR
METAL -- Kirk's mind races -- he looks around for a way to save
his new friend -- just then a STRONG CURRENT IS FELT inside the
tube -- AND SCOTTY IS YANKED AWAY, DOWN THE TUBE!

KIRK
-- no-- shit!

And Kirk runs after him -- down the length of the ORANGE,
TWISTING and TURNING tubes -- SCOTTY SEEN every time he enters a
CLEAR TUBE AREA -- then DISAPPEARING again into the ORANGE tubes
-- and Scotty gets sucked UPWARDS -- and Kirk turns and looks --
FOLLOWS THE LENGTH OF TUBE -- SEEING WHERE IT'S HEADING -- TO A
GIANT WATER TURBINE -- essentially? A MASSIVE FUCKING BLENDER.

KIRK (CONT'D)
-- no--nonono--

And Kirk HAULS ASS to the control panel -- we see the huge
machine -- overhead, the RELEASE VALVE under the pipe -- and
Kirk works as fast as he can --

KIRK (CONT'D)
COMEONCOMEONCOMEON -- like the simulator:
manual control enabled, pressure seal:
enabled -- shutdown--

COMPUTER VOICE
Turbine Shutdown Not Allowed.

KIRK
DAMNIT!

Keptin, we're detecting unauthorized
access to a water turbine control board!

Spock moves from Sarek to Chekov --

SPOCK
Bring up video.

Chekov brings up TWO DOZEN SECURITY VIDEO IMAGES ON ONE SCREEN.
Spock points to one -- it ENLARGES -- and we see KIRK AND SCOTTY
racing through the ship -- Spock's eyes narrow -- he moves to
the Captain's chair -- hits comm:

181A INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING BAY - CONTINUOUS                   181A

Kirk, AT THE PANEL, accesses the RELEASE VALVE CONTROL -- he
watches Scotty disappear through a CLEAR SECTION -- Kirk times
it -- waiting -- then he HITS THE BUTTON and Scotty DROPS
THROUGH THE RELEASE VALVE AND SLAMS TO THE FLOOR -- hurt, wet,
but BREATHING, deeply --

KIRK
You all right?

SCOTTY
(recovering, looking
around)
-- nice -- (cough) -- ship. Really.

KIRK

181B INT. ENTERPRISE - VARIOUS AREAS                                  181B

Kirk and wet Scotty race through the ship -- only to finally
turn a corner and be faced with PHASERS, AIMED RIGHT AT THEM.

But suddenly PHASERS are at their heads. Two SECURITY GUARDS --
one, THE GUY HE GOT INTO THE FIGHT WITH AT THE BAR, YEARS AGO.

SECURITY OFFICER  1
Come with me.     Moon Beam.

Off Kirk -- shit --

182-3 OMIT                                                        182-3

WOOSH -- bridge doors open -- Kirk and Scotty are ushered in by
the Security Guards. Spock moves to them, containing his anger
and dismay. McCoy is here as well. Spock walks right up to
Kirk... raises his eyebrow.

KIRK
Surprise.

SPOCK
(to Scotty)
Who are you?

KIRK
He's with me.

106
184   CONTINUED:                                                        184

SPOCK
We're travelling at warp -- how did you
manage to get aboard this ship?

Kirk stares at the young Spock -- a different experience now --

KIRK
You're the genius, you figure it out.

SPOCK
As Captain of this vessel I order you to
answer the question.

KIRK
Well I'm not telling.
(then)
Captain.

HUH.   That confounds Spock.   And Kirk is off to the races --

KIRK (CONT'D)
Does that frustrate you? My lack of
cooperation... does it make you angry?

Spock again focuses on Scotty --

SPOCK
You are not a member of this ship's crew.
Under penalty of court martial, I order
you to explain to me how you beamed ab --

KIRK
(to Scotty)
-- Don't answer him.

SPOCK
You will answer me.

ON SCOTTY.   Weighing all this.     Then --

SCOTTY
I'd rather not take sides.

Spock nods back to the SECURITY GUARDS, over this --

SPOCK
Escort them to the Brig.

But before the guards can do so --

KIRK
What is it about you, Spock? Your planet
was just destroyed -- your mother
murdered -- and you're not even upset?

107
184   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  184

SPOCK
Your presumption that these experiences
interfere with my abilities to command
this ship is inaccurate--

KIRK
HA! And yet you said fear was necessary
for command. I mean -- did you see that
bastard's ship? Did you see what he did?

SPOCK
(tense)
Yes, of course I--

KIRK
So are you afraid or aren't you?!?

SPOCK
(tenser)
I will not... allow you to lecture me
about the merits of emotion.

Kirk gets close to Spock --

KIRK
Then why don't you stop me.

Sarek watches, tense.   McCoy, too.   Spock blinks --

SPOCK
Step away from me, Mr. Kirk.

KIRK
What is it like? Not to feel? Anger.
Or heartbreak. Or the need to stop at
nothing to avenge the death of the woman
who gave birth to you?!

SPOCK
(volcanic)
-- back away --

KIRK
(closer still)
You must not feel anything! It must not
even compute for you! You must not have
loved her at all--!

-- WHAM! SPOCK HAS JUST HIT KIRK -- and Kirk goes to hit back,
but Spock fucking DELIVERS A SERIES OF POWERFUL BLOWS --
Security stand back as the Captain attacks...

And Spock is now fucking CHOKING Kirk -- HE SLAMS KIRK AGAINST
THE WALL -- SPOCK'S CHOKING THE LIFE OUT OF HIM --

108
184   CONTINUED: (3)                                                      184

SAREK
Spock!

And everything -- everything -- STOPS. Spock, red-faced,
releases his grip. Kirk GULPS air and tumbles to the ground.
Spock staggers back. Kirk's hardly able to speak, close to
collapsing. But despite his brutalized face, his expression
isn't about spite, or hatred... but compassion.

Spock sees the faces of the STUNNED CREW staring at him. But
worst of all? Sarek. His father. Spock levels his chin.
Quickly wipes his eyes. Trying to regain some semblance of
dignity... looks to McCoy. Softly --

SPOCK
Doctor. I am no longer fit for duty. I
hereby relinquish my command on the
grounds that I have been... emotionally
compromised. Please note the time and
date in the ship's log.

JESUS. Spock just... QUIT. And after a beat, he leaves the
room. Sarek follows a moment later.

The crew just stands there in stunned SILENCE.   Finally --

SCOTTY
I like this ship. It's exciting.

McCoy turns to Kirk, exasperated --

MCCOY
Congratulations, Jim. Now we've got no
Captain and no first officer to goddamn
replace him.

ON KIRK.   The moment is upon him.

KIRK
Yeah we do.

ON MCCOY. The CREW -- confused. Sulu just fucking POINTS at
Kirk and they all realize HOLY SHIT -- Pike made KIRK the First
Officer before he left!

MCCOY
WHAT?!

KIRK
Thanks for the support!

And Kirk moves to the captain's chair, passing Uhura:

UHURA (CONT'D)
Right now. Where the hell'd you get
trans-warp technology?

KIRK
-- yeah, you know that's complicated --

UHURA
Do I look simple to you?!

SULU
I'm a PhD in astrophysics, I think I can
handle it -- how'd you get back?

CHEKOV
You vant us to trust you but you von't
tell us the truth?

KIRK
No. No, I won't-- hey, I'm the Captain
now! I don't have to tell you anything!
Now listen: we need to figure out a way
to catch up and get to Nero's ship.

SULU
There's not a chance. They're gonna be
in geosynchronous orbit around Earth in
ten minutes. We'll never make it.

MCCOY
Even if we could, you can't go in guns
blazing, not with their technology,
that's suicide.

KIRK
Then we find a way to get on that ship
and steal the black hole device away from
them.

SCOTTY
Well you can forget transwarp. No way to
predict the Narada's position from here.

KIRK
Uhura: anything from Captain Pike?

UHURA
No... I've been monitoring all channels.

188   INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER BAY  SET CHANGE                  188

SPOCK stand here, staring at the place where his mother should
have, but didn't, arrive. Sarek enters. Sees his son. They're
alone for the first time in ages. A beat:

188   CONTINUED:                                                       188

SAREK
You must not punish yourself.
(beat)
Speak your mind, Spock.

SPOCK
That would be unwise.

SAREK
What is necessary is always wise.

Watch Spock's face.   Struggling with what's pent-up inside...

SPOCK
I feel as conflicted as I once was. As a
child. Have I made so little progress?

SAREK
(beat, softly)
You will always be a child of two worlds.
I am grateful for that. And for you.
(painfully)
And not only because you are all I have
left of her.

Spock looks at Sarek.   This is as close to emotion as he'll get.

SPOCK
I feel anger. For the one who took her
life. An anger I cannot stop.

SAREK
I believe she would say... do not try to.
(then)
You asked me once. Why I married your
mother.
(beat, simply)
I married her because I loved her.

Their look HOLDS -- and for Spock, a revelation...

189   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE                                         189

-- the strategy session continues in FULL SWING -- now Chekov,
the youngest of the bunch, gets up the courage to chime in,
incidently becoming the very first officer to say:

CHEKOV
Keptin Kirk?    Excuse me, plees, could
I...?

All eyes shift to the wonder-kid who awaits permission to speak:

111
189   CONTINUED:                                                      189

KIRK
Yes, Chekov-- you don't need to ask
permission to--

CHEKOV
Based on the Narada's course from Vulcan,
I've projected that Nero will travel past
Saturn. If we could drop out of warp
behind one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan,
the magnetic distortion from the planet's
rings will make us invisible to Nero's
sensors. We could follow him to Earth by
staying in his blind spot.

KIRK
What blind spot?

CHEKOV
Its exhaust wake. If we adjust our
shield frequencies, they shouldn't detect
us.

MCCOY
Wait a minute-- anyone understand this
kid? How old are you?

CHEKOV
I am seventeen, Sir, how old are you?

MCCOY
We're all old enough to shave here.

SPOCK (O.S.)
Doctor... Mr. Chekov is correct.

Everyone turns, surprised: SPOCK has entered the bay --
galvanized, full of purpose --

SPOCK (CONT'D)
I have reviewed his telemetry. If Mr.
Sulu can maneuver us into position, I can
beam aboard Nero's ship.

KIRK
I won't order you to do that, Mr. Spock.

SPOCK
Romulans and Vulcans share a common
ancestry. Our cultural similarities will
make it easier for me to access their
ship's computer to locate the device.
(beat; a flicker of
emotion)

SPOCK (CONT'D)
Also, my mother was human. Which makes
Earth the only home I have left.

112
189   CONTINUED: (3)                                                  189

The crew looks at this very courageous Vulcan with deep respect -
- but his focus is on Uhura, whose eyes smile back at him.

KIRK
Then I'm coming with you.

SPOCK
(beat, considering)
I would cite regulation, but I know you
will simply ignore it.

KIRK
See, we're getting to know each other.

And a MOMENT -- a burgeoning friendship --

190   EXT. BARREN LANDSCAPE                                            190

PANNING ACROSS AN ALIEN LANDSCAPE... and even though it's in
shadow, you start to recognize it as THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.
OUR POV ascends now to see:

THE ENTERPRISE DROPS OUT OF WARP IN THE DEAD SILENCE OF SPACE...

And we move past it, along the orbit of the moon, cresting the
horizon to see EARTH -- AND NERO'S SHIP HOVERING ABOVE IT.

191   INT. NARADA - BRIDGE - NIGHT                                     191

CLOSE ON NERO -- his face illuminated on the DARKENED BRIDGE of
the Narada by SOFT BLUE LIGHT. Light radiated by EARTH. A
BEAUTIFUL HOLOGRAM before him. He doesn't notice behind him, as
those BLADES from his STAFF APPEAR BEHIND HIS NECK. Nero
tenses, only now sensing this unforeseen danger: AYEL HOLDS THE
WEAPON. Strong. Tough. But under it all... terrified.

AYEL
The men and I have discussed this. What
we are about to do.
(beat)
We have to turn the ship around. We can
save our home.

Nero turns slowly and deliberately -- Ayel tenses:

AYEL (CONT'D)
Stop.

Nero now faces Ayel, blades at his throat -- Ayel growing more
nervous as he faces his master. The surrounding crew stare on,
frozen in the moment, only slightly confirming their makeshift
mutiny with scared looks.

113
191   CONTINUED:                                                            191

AYEL (CONT'D)
We can go back. That's what we want. We
have taken our vengeance on Vulcan. No
more. We want to go home now.

Nero considers this... nods gently.

NERO
There is no need, Ayel.   To threaten me.
(beat)
I understand.

Ayel is massively relieved.     Nero gently reaches out, holds the
staff (still aimed at him).     He deactivates it -- the blades
instantly RETRACT.

NERO (CONT'D)
I understand.    But you are wrong.

And just as Ayel realizes he's fucked, Nero somehow activates
the staff in a way we have not seen -- AND THE BLADES APPEAR ON
THE OTHER END -- THE END NOW FACING AYEL -- AND JUST AS AYEL'S
EYES GO WIDE -- NERO THRUSTS THE BLADES INTO AYEL -- WHO FALLS
TO THE FLOOR, DEAD! Nero's hard face turns to the rest of his
crew.

NERO (CONT'D)
We will return to Romulus when the
Federation lies in ruins and not a moment
before. When those who watched our
people burn at last understand our pain,
our loss. I refuse to return as a slave!
We will return as conquerors!

ON THE FACES OF THE MEN, SUBMITTING TO HIS WILL, our MUSIC
BUILDING -- and then, his eyes on Earth like a fucking LION eyes
a gazelle--

NERO (CONT'D)
Deploy the drill.

192   EXT. THE NARADA                                                       192

No sign of Kirk and Spock.     Sulu's in the captain's chair.
Chekov at helm.

SULU
Mr. Chekov, transfer manual control to
the Captain's chair.

CHEKOV
Aye.
(works controls)
I've projected the parabolic course you
must follow. If you deviate by so much
as a meter, we will be detected.

SULU
Give me one quarter impulse burst for
five seconds and I'll do the rest with
thrusters. On my mark. Three... two...
one... fire.

194   EXT. U.S.S. ENTERPRISE - SPACE                                  194

The impulse engines SURGE, shutting off as the ship slips out
from behind the moon and into open space --

195   INT. U.S.S. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                    195

Sulu makes rapid-fire thruster combinations to stay on track --
a stealthy ballet of incredible dexterity. THE NARADA appears
over the horizon in geosynchronous orbit, passing underneath the
Enterprise as they arc in behind it.

SULU
All stop in three... two... one...

196   EXT. THE NARADA ENTERPRISE - CONTINUOUS                         196

The small Enterprise pulls into position behind the massive
Narada's BLIND SPOT and comes to a gentle stop. Tension --

KIRK and SPOCK ready themselves for transport. STRAP ON UTILITY
BELTS: COM-SETS, TRICORDERS, and of course, PHASERS --

SCOTTY

Well done, Mr. Sulu.

198   CONTINUED:                                                         198

KIRK
Whatever happens Mr. Sulu, if you feel
you have a tactical advantage fire on
that ship. Even if we're still aboard.
It's an order.

SULU
Yessir.   Good luck.

Spock turns to Uhura, who hands him a small TRANSLATOR DEVICE:

UHURA
We'll be monitoring your frequency...

Uhura gives the translator to Spock -- AND HE KISSES UHURA.

SPOCK
Thank you, Nyota.

They part, revealing KIRK'S SHOCKED FACE. Uhura walks off,
leaving the two men -- Kirk looking stunned at Spock.

KIRK
Her first name is...

SPOCK
I have no comment on the matter.

Kirk still stunned as Scotty moves to transporter control.

SCOTTY
If there's any common sense to their ship
design, I'll be puttin' ya in a cargo
bay, shouldn't be a soul in sight.

KIRK AND SPOCK STAND ON THE TRANSPORTER PAD, SIDE-BY-SIDE AND
FACING THE SAME DIRECTION FOR THE FIRST TIME -- AN ICONIC IMAGE -
- The moment of truth.

KIRK
Energize.

Scotty hits the transport and Kirk and Spock DISAPPEAR --

199   INT. NARADA - CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS                               199

Kirk and Spock MATERIALIZE in the cargo bay... to find
themselves suddenly smack-dab in the middle of SIX ROMULAN
GUARDS working at cargo consoles!!

116
199   CONTINUED:                                                        199

For a split second they're as shocked as Kirk and Spock, until
they ATTACK -- Kirk immediately engages the closest Romulan,
struggles -- but Spock's a machine: his palm snaps up CRACKING a
nose -- SLAMS a head against the wall -- as battle-ready as the
Romulans are, it's like trying to catch a GHOST, Kirk finally
knocks his one opponent unconscious, and turns to see it's ALL
OVER --

KIRK
(a touch insecure)
Mine had a gun.

SPOCK
I am trained in the Vulcan martial art of
Suus Mahna.

Kirk and Spock move to a still conscious Romulan as he struggles
to get up. Spock reaches for the fallen Romulan's temples.

SPOCK (CONT'D)
I am unable to meld with these Romulans --
there are subtle differences in their
physiology I did not anticipate --

KIRK                                SPOCK
-- punch him in the face --
make him talk! Suus Mahna his       -- Suss Mahna is only intended
ass!                                for self-defense, he's no
longer a threat --
-- then pretend it's a threat -
- I'm your captain, that's an
order!

Spock PUNCHES the Romulan HARD -- and via Uhura's comlink
translator, speaks in SUBTITLED ROMULAN:

SPOCK (SUBTITLE) (CONT'D)
What is your computer access code?

The guard SPITS green blood at Spock, who PUNCHES him again --

SPOCK (SUBTITLE) (CONT'D)
TELL! (PUNCH)    ME! (PUNCH) THE! (PUNCH)

UHURA

204   INT. NARADA - CONTINUOUS                                           204

A ROTATING SHIP SCHEMATIC -- Spock typing at a console,
searching -- accesses two inter-cam windows: on one, SPOCK
PRIME'S SHIP, THE JELLYFISH -- in a lower containment hold -- on
the other: PIKE, unclear if he's dead or alive.

SPOCK
What you refer to as the "Red Matter
Device" is in the main hangar -- and I've
located Captain Pike.

KIRK
Is he alive?

SPOCK
Unknown.

KIRK
Let's move.

They cover each other with phasers as they move down the hall --

206   INT. JELLYFISH - COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS                           206

Kirk hits a console, a familiar voice comes to life:

COMPUTER VOICE
Voice print and face recognition analysis
enabled.

KIRK
Spock, you'll be piloting the ship alone.

SPOCK
Which may be problematic, as I am
unfamiliar with this ship's design.

THE LASER GRID RESPONDS TO SPOCK'S VOICE, scans his features for
ID -- THE HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY MATERIALIZES:

COMPUTER VOICE
Welcome back, Ambassador Spock.

KIRK
(awkwardly)
Wow.   That's weird.

He looks to Kirk in surprise -- Spock's eyes fix with sudden
understanding. Ambassador Spock... of course... suddenly all
the pieces start coming together...

SPOCK
Computer: what is your manufacturing
origin?

COMPUTER VOICE
Stardate 2397, commissioned by the Vulcan
Science Academy.

Spock looks at Kirk, a touch upset:

SPOCK
It appears you've been keeping rather
important information from me.

KIRK
Just trust me.      Can ya do that?

Spock weigh his options.     Trust.   Finally:

228   EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                         228

EVERYTHING'S GETTING SUCKED INTO THE EVER-EXPANDING BLACK HOLE --
A MASSIVE PULSE OF ENERGY PUMMELS NERO'S SHIP, SHEARING THROUGH
ITS HULL -- AS THE NARADA TRIES TO REVERSE OUT OF THE GRAVITY
WELL, THE ENTERPRISE IS REVEALED BEHIND IT -- HAVING BEEN THERE
THE WHOLE TIME --

229   INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER BAY - CONTINUOUS                  229

IT'S A RUSH, CRAZY, TENSE AS HELL --Uhura, McCoy, a MED TEAM and
ND OFFICERS race in as Scotty finishes receiving incoming
signals:

KIRK, SPOCK... AND PIKE MATERIALIZE ON THE PAD:

KIRK
(to Transporter Chief)
Nice timing, Lieutenant --

SCOTTY
Never beamed two targets from two places
onto the same pad before! That was
pretty good!

Kirk transfers Pike to McCoy, who urgently SCANS Pike and barks
to a MED-TECH:

MCCOY
-- we're gonna need gastric stimulators,
let's prep him for surgery, now!

230   INT. NARADA - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                               230

Everyone's HURLED off their feet -- consoles fry -- FIRE --

ROMULAN COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
Nero-- it's the Enterprise!

NERO
LOAD WEAPONS AND RAISE SHIELDS!!!

ROMULAN HELMSMAN
ENGINES USING ALL OUR POWER, SIR!

Nero's eyes come UNHINGED --

231   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                           231

WHOOSH: KIRK and SPOCK race back onto the bridge --

CHEKOV
Keptin! The enemy ship is losing power--
its shields are down!

124
231   CONTINUED:                                                      231

KIRK
Hail them -- now!

NERO appears on screen from the Narada bridge -- the Narada's on
its last legs -- a beat before Nero TURNS, realizing Kirk's
fucking GRINNING at him from the screen:

KIRK (CONT'D)
This is Captain James T. Kirk of the
U.S.S. Enterprise -- your ship is
compromised -- too close to the
singularity to survive without assistance
-- which we are willing to provide.

SPOCK
(sotto)
Captain -- what are you doing?

KIRK
(sotto)
We show them compassion-- it may be the
only way to earn peace with Romulus.
It's logic, Spock! I thought you'd like
that.

SPOCK
No, not really, not this time.

NERO
I would rather suffer the death of
Romulus a thousand times than accept
assistance from you.

KIRK
You got it.
(turns)
Lock phasers! Fire everything we've got!

232   EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                         232

THE ENTERPRISE ARCS AROUND, FIRING A FULL SALVO AT THE NARADA --
AND THE HITS CONNECT, A DOMINO-EFFECT OF EXPLOSIONS RIPPLING
ACROSS THE ALREADY WEAKENED SHIP -- IT STARTS NOSE-DIVING,
TOWARD THE BLACK HOLE --

233   INT. U.S.S. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE                                 233

KIRK
Kirk to Engineering: get us out of here,
Scotty!

SCOTTY (V.O.; COMMS)
-- you bet yer ass, Captain --

125


234   INT. NARADA - CONTINUOUS                                           234

The walls are RIPPING AWAY, PYLONS pull free from their
moorings, into the ever-expanding sphere -- NERO -- IN THE
CHAOS, KNOWING HE'S REACHED THE END, CLOSES HIS EYES:

NERO
Forgive me... Romulus...

235   EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                            235

AND THE NARADA IMPLODES, BUCKLING IN ON ITSELF, DISAPPEARING IN
PIECES INTO THE BLACK VORTEX --

Leaving only the Enterprise -- its nacelles FLARE as the ship
tries to make the quantum leap -- BUT: the black hole's now a
TITANIC WHIRLPOOL so insanely strong that the Enterprise is held
in place by the gravity well even at warp! IT SHAKES INTO A
BLUR, trying to cut loose but it CAN'T --

236   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                              236

KIRK
WHY AREN'T WE AT WARP?!

CHEKOV
-- WE ARE --!

SCOTTY OVER SPEAKERS
CAPTAIN, WE'RE TRAPPED IN THE GRAVITY
WELL! IT'S GOT US!

KIRK
GO TO MAXIMUM WARP!       PUSH IT!!!

237   INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING - INTERCUTTING:                      237

Scotty SHOUTS BACK into the com against the SCREAMING DRIVE:

SCOTTY
I'M GIVIN' HER ALL SHE'S GOT, CAPTAIN!

KIRK
ALL SHE'S GOT ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH!       WHAT
ELSE D'YOU GOT?!

SCOTTY
(last desperate thought)
IF WE EJECT THE CORE AND DETONATE, THE
BLAST COULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PUSH US
AWAY BUT I CAN'T PROMISE ANYTHING!

KIRK
DO IT DO IT DO IT!

126
237   CONTINUED:                                                          237

Scotty SLAMS the activation panel and we see the WARP CORE eject
down a tube, like an INSTANT PNEUMATIC RELEASE --

238   EXT. ENTERPRISE - ABOVE THE BLACK HOLE - CONTINUOUS                 238

THE WARP CORE TUBE LAUNCHES FROM THE ENTERPRISE, STREAKING RIGHT
INTO THE MOUTH OF THE BLACK HOLE -- AN INSANE, SILENT EXPLOSION:
THE BLACK HOLE LIGHTS UP FROM HORIZON TO HORIZON, THE BLAST WAVE
WHITING OUT THE FRAME! THE ENTERPRISE IS CONSUMED WITHIN IT:

FOR A MINUTE, WE THINK IT'S GONE... UNTIL IT'S JETTISONED OUT
INTO THE STARS, FLYING AWAY, LEAVING THE FIRESTORM BEHIND IT!

239   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                               239

Everyone white-knuckles their seats as the blast DISSIPATES...
and our crew sits, wide-eyed, trembling... finally, truly safe.

240   EXT. STARFLEET ACADEMY - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY                        240

Back home.

241   INT. STARFLEET ACADEMY - MEDICAL BAY HANGAR - DAY                   241

Spock is seen in a medical office with Pike, who lies in bed,
recovering -- McCoy monitors him - Spock exits -- walks through
the corridor -- sees a VULCAN in silhouette, staring out at the
Academy. Sarek. Spock moves to him -- says quietly:

SPOCK
Father...?

Sarek turns -- but IT ISN'T SAREK.   IT'S SPOCK PRIME.     Who says:

SPOCK PRIME
I am not... our father.

An incredible beat, our two Spocks in eye lock... both minds
processing conversational possibilities at an incredible rate...
surreal extensions of each other, separate but connected...

SPOCK
... Fascinating.

SPOCK PRIME
There are so few Vulcans left.    We cannot
afford to ignore each other.

Young Spock's eyes flicker in puzzlement...

SPOCK
Then why did you send Kirk aboard when
you alone could've explained the truth?

127
241   CONTINUED:                                                      241

SPOCK PRIME
(beat, simply)
Because you needed each other. Opposing
yet complimentary opposites. It was that
balance between us -- I should say
you and Kirk -- that often made the
impossible, possible.

SPOCK
... it was a test?

SPOCK PRIME
(no: his heart heavy)
I'm in no position to pass judgment...
my actions have robbed you of much. I
could not also deprive you the revelation
of all you can accomplish together... of
a friendship that will define you both in
ways you cannot yet realize.

There is, to young Spock's surprise, vulnerability in that.

SPOCK
How did you persuade him to keep your
secret?

SPOCK PRIME
I inferred universe-ending paradoxes
would ensue should he break his promise.

SPOCK
You lied.

SPOCK PRIME
I implied.

SPOCK
A gamble...

SPOCK PRIME
An act of faith. One I hope you'll
repeat in the future.

Young Spock considers an enduring friendship between him and
Kirk... for the first time, understanding it. But --

SPOCK
The future's not what it used to be... in
the face of extinction, it's only logical
I resign my Starfleet commission and help
rebuild our race.

127A
241   CONTINUED: (2)                                            241

SPOCK PRIME
And yet, you are in a unique position...
you can be in two places at once.
(MORE)

128
241   CONTINUED: (3)                                                    241
SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
(beat)
I urge you to remain in Starfleet: I've
already located a suitable planet on
which to establish a Vulcan colony, and
assist in the foundation of a new science
academy.

Young Spock takes that in, resolute...

SPOCK
My future cannot be determined by your
past. We are one, but not the same.

SPOCK PRIME
Then I ask that you do yourself a favor.
Put away logic. Do what feels right.
The world you've inherited lives in the
shadow of incalculable devastation... but
there's no reason you must face it alone.

Spock Prime moves to the door, stops.    Offers the VULCAN SALUTE:

SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
As my customary farewell would appear
oddly self serving, I will simply say...
good luck.

Their eyes hold. Spock turns, disappearing into the corridor.
Young Spock stares at the empty doorway a beat, his mind a
jumble of thoughts... and our MUSIC BUILDS...

242   INT. STARFLEET CORRIDOR - HANGAR - CONTINUOUS                     242

As Spock Prime walks off down the corridor, he passes right by a
man conferring with a nurse -- the man pauses, turns... it's
SAREK. Suddenly overcome by a feeling that the stranger who's
just passed him is... oddly familiar.

243   INT. STARFLEET ACADEMY - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY                   243

MUSIC STILL BUILDING -- glass walls reveal THE ENTERPRISE at
dock, UTILITY CRAFTS floating around it, repairing. Standing at
attention in rows, THE ENTERPRISE CREW -- over four hundred of
them wearing DRESS UNIFORMS -- TRACK DOWN the faces, all proud --
and we STOP ON YOUNG KIRK. Composed, focused, a man. The
ACADEMY PRESIDENT stands at a podium:

ACADEMY PRESIDENT
This assembly calls Captain James
Tiberius Kirk...

129
243   CONTINUED:                                                       243

Kirk breaks from formation, pivots, marches down the hangar --
past UHURA... SULU... CHEKOV... SCOTTY. All Beaming. Notably
absent, is Spock. Kirk ascends the stairs, snaps to attention:

ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
Your inspirational valor and supreme
dedication to your comrades are in
keeping with the highest traditions of
service and reflect utmost credit to
yourself, your crew, and the Federation.
For your... unique solution to the
Kobayashi Maru, it's my honor to award
you with a commendation for original
thinking.

He opens a BOX -- glorious in repose, a MEDAL:

ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
By Starfleet Order 28455, you are hereby
directed to report to Commanding Officer,
USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.

Kirk turns. Walks to... PIKE. In a wheelchair now, wearing an
ADMIRAL'S UNIFORM. Overnight, his hair's turned totally grey --
but despite his trauma, his pride's overwhelming. They SALUTE:

KIRK
I relieve you, Sir.

PIKE
I am relieved. Congratulations, Captain.

Pike containing a smirk, pins the medal to Kirk's chest.

KIRK
Thank you, Sir.

Kirk turns to the crowd. Eyes shining. WILD APPLAUSE. As Kirk
rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations, we go to the BACK
of the hangar... SPOCK PRIME. Watching. Moved beyond words.
He turns and leaves them to it... and our MUSIC SWELLS as --

244   INT. U.S.S. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                     244

The turbolift WHOOSHES open and in walks Kirk -- to every fan's
delight, wearing his iconic GOLD SHIRT. All around him, our
crew -- young and fresh-faced but no longer children -- in
charge of the greatest starship ever built:

130
244   CONTINUED:                                                           244

SULU
Maneuvering thrusters and impulse engines
at your command, Sir.

CHEKOV
Weapons systems and shields on standby.

UHURA
Dock control reports ready.    Yard Command
signalling clear.

KIRK
Scotty how are we?

SCOTTY (O.S. OVER COMM LINK)
Dilithium chamber at maximum efficiency,
Captain.

MCCOY
(wry grin)
Same ship, different day.

And Kirk pauses. His eyes go over to the empty science console
with a sense of incompleteness. In fact, everyone on the bridge
feels it. A bitter truth they'll have to accept.

KIRK
Mr. Sulu, prepare to engage thrus--

WHOOSH: the turbolift door opens.      SPOCK!!!   Wearing his BLUE
UNIFORM. Our hearts soar --

SPOCK
Permission to come aboard, Captain.

KIRK
... Permission granted.

SPOCK
As you have yet to select a first
officer, respectfully, I would like to
submit my candidacy. Should you desire,
I can provide character references.

Kirk nearly laughs. Spock's eyebrow goes up. Something passes
between them... it carries acceptance, and trust...

KIRK
It would be my honor, Commander.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.     Take us
out.

SULU
Aye, Captain.

131
244   CONTINUED: (2)                                                      244

As the ship maneuvers out of dry dock, Spock takes his place
next to Kirk. Gold and blue, side by side.

245   EXT. STARBASE ONE - DRYDOCK - CONTINUOUS                            245

And the ship crests the drydock portal, drifting into space...
blessed one last time by the voice of our Vulcan hero:

SPOCK NIMOY
Space... the final frontier. These are
the continuing voyages of the Starship
Enterprise. Her ongoing mission... to
explore strange new worlds... to seek out
new life forms, and new civilizations...
To boldly go, where no one has gone...
before...

The TREK THEME SOARS as the Enterprise warps off into a universe
of infinite possibilities...

FADE OUT.

ALTERNATE SCENE A

THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE TO BE ASSIGNED TO MAIN OR ADDITIONAL
BRIDGE CREW IF TIME AND CASTING PERMITS.

INT. KELVIN BRIDGE

CAPTAIN ROBAU
... oh my God...
(to himself, boggled)
A lightning storm... then this...
(to deck)
Signal all departments: first contact
protocols. Looks like we have someone
new on the block. All Stop.

KELVIN CREW MEMBER
All stations, FC-3 procedures
initiated..."

KELVIN CREW MEMBER COMMS
Broadcasting universal greeting on all
open frequencies.

FIRST OFFICER
Sir, should we initiate an active scan?

CAPTAIN ROBAU
That could be seen as an act of
provocation -- all readings passive--

Crew members are glued to their telemetry, working consoles:

KELVIN CREW MEMBER
EM sensors in passive sweep...

KELVIN CREW MEMBER (CONT'D)
Power signature detected -- level's
increasing.

Suddenly, a WARNING BEEP --



OFFICER PITTS                      CAPTAIN ROBAU
Sir, I have a reading --
they've locked weapons on us!     -- Red alert!   Arm weapons!

ALARMS BLARE -- LIGHTS GO RED as --

133


EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS

The Narada FIRES a TORPEDO -- IT HEADS FOR THE KELVIN -- then
SEPARATES, fracturing into a multi-hit projectile --

INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - CONTINUOUS

Officers SCRAMBLE, brace for impact --



FIRST OFFICER                      CAPTAIN ROBAU
Torpedo locked on us at 320
degrees, mark two -- incoming      -- Evasive pattern Delta-5!
fast!

CREW MEMBER
Redirecting auxiliary power to forward
shields!"

CREW MEMBER (CONT'D)
Aft torpedo tubes are hot!

EXT. U.S.S. KELVIN - CONTINUOUS

A direct hit SMASHES several decks along the DISH of the ship --

INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Captain Robau helps a fallen CREW MEMBER up from the floor --
then, on his chair com:

CAPTAIN ROBAU
Damage report!

INTERCUT with:

INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Moving with the Kelvin's CHIEF ENGINEER:

KELVIN CREW MEMBER
Diagnostic's back online -- rerouting to
auxiliary console.

KELVIN CREW MEMBER 2
Power grid junctions C-7 and E-3 are
out...

KELVIN CREW MEMBER
Dispatch repair teams to deck 4.

134
CONTINUED:

CHIEF ENGINEER
Our shields did nothing, Sir! Never seen
anything like it! Weapons off-line!
Main power at 38 percent!

135
CONTINUED: (2)




ALTERNATE SCENE B

SPOCK PRIME
Then I ask that you do yourself a
favor... put away logic, and do what
feels right. The world you've inherited
lives in the shadow of incalculable
devastation... but there's no reason you
must face it alone.

And from around his neck, he removes the PENDANT that until now,
we've only caught glimpses of. Places it on the table beside
his younger self. The feeling in his eyes is profound...

SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
This was a gift to me.   Representing...
a dream. One we were unable to fulfill.
(softly)
The way you can now.

And moves to the door.    Stops.   Offers the VULCAN SALUTE:

SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
As my customary farewell would appear
oddly self serving, I will simply say...
good luck.

Their eyes hold. Spock turns, disappearing into the corridor.
Young Spock stares at the empty doorway a beat, his mind a
jumble of thoughts. Looks to the pendant... and realizes it's a
HOLO-EMITTER. After considering a beat, he hits an activation
button and a MOVING HOLOGRAPHIC MESSAGE materializes before him:

CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK. WILLIAM SHATNER.      As always, brash, wry,
confident -- and SINGING:

KIRK  SHATNER
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to
you...
(stops, grins)
I know I know, it's illogical to
celebrate something you had nothing to do
with, but I haven't had the chance to
congratulate you on your appointment to
the ambassadorship so I thought I'd seize
the occasion... Bravo, Spock -- they tell
me your first mission may take you away
for awhile, so I'll be the first to wish
you luck... and to say...
(beat, emotional)
I miss you, old friend.

136
CONTINUED: (3)

... and we're PUSHING IN on Young Spock, taking in the image of
Kirk's future self, the message, but above all -- the clear,
unquestionable friendship these two men had...

INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

As Spock Prime walks off down the corridor, he passes right by a
man conferring with a nurse -- the man pauses, turns... it's
SAREK. Suddenly overcome by a feeling that the stranger who's
just passed him is... oddly familiar.

KIRK SHATNER (V.O.)
I suppose I'd always imagined us...
outgrowing Starfleet together. Watching
life swing us into our Emeritus years...

INT. STARBASE ONE - HANGAR - ETERNAL NIGHT

MUSIC BUILDING -- glass walls reveal THE ENTERPRISE at dock,
UTILITY CRAFTS floating around it, repairing. Standing at
attention in rows, THE ENTERPRISE CREW -- over four hundred of
them wearing DRESS UNIFORMS -- TRACK DOWN the faces, all proud:

KIRK SHATNER (V.O.)
I look around at the new cadets now and
can't help thinking... has it really been
so long? Wasn't it only yesterday we
stepped onto the Enterprise as boys?
That I had to prove to the crew I
deserved command... and their respect?

And we STOP ON YOUNG KIRK. Composed, focused, proud. A man.
And to every fan's delight, finally wearing his YELLOW SHIRT.
The FEDERATION COMMANDANT stands at a podium:

COMMANDANT
This assembly calls Captain James
Tiberius Kirk...

Kirk breaks from formation, pivots, marches down the hangar --
past UHURA... SULU... CHEKOV... SCOTTY. All Beaming. Notably
absent, is Spock. Kirk ascends the stairs, snaps to attention:

COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
Your inspirational valor and supreme
dedication to your comrades are in
keeping with the highest traditions of
service and reflect utmost credit to
yourself, your crew, and the Federation.
By Starfleet Order 28455, you are hereby
directed to report to Commanding Officer,
USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.

137
CONTINUED:

Kirk turns. Walks to... PIKE. In a wheelchair now, wearing an
ADMIRAL'S UNIFORM. Overnight, his hair's turned totally grey --
but despite his trauma, his pride's overwhelming. They SALUTE
each other:

KIRK
I relieve you, Sir.

PIKE
... I am relieved.

He opens a BOX in his lap -- glorious in repose, a MEDAL:

PIKE (CONT'D)
And as Fleet Admiral, for your... unique
solution to the Kobayashi Maru, it's my
honor to award you with a commendation
for original thinking.

Pike containing a smirk, pins the medal to Kirk's chest...

PIKE (CONT'D)
(a touch choked)
Congratulations, Captain.

KIRK
Thank you, Sir.

Kirk turns to the crowd. Eyes shining. WILD APPLAUSE.    OUR
MUSIC SOARS. Bones leans in to Sulu, rolling his eyes:

BONES
... Same ship, different day.

As Kirk rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations, we go to
the BACK of the hangar... SPOCK PRIME. Watching. Moved beyond
words. He turns and leaves them to it... as he goes...

KIRK SHATNER (V.O.)
I know what you'd say --  It's their turn
now, Jim...' And of course you're
right... but it got me thinking:

INT. STARFLEET HOSPITAL - EARTH - DAY

Our montage comes full circle as we END on Kirk's transmission:

KIRK SHATNER
Who's to say we can't go one more round?
By the last tally, only twenty five
percent of the galaxy's been chartered...
I'd call that negligent. Criminal even --
an invitation.
(MORE)

138
CONTINUED:
KIRK SHATNER (CONT'D)
You once said being a starship captain
was my first, best destiny... if that's
true, then yours is to be by my side. If
there's any true logic to the universe...
we'll end up on that bridge again
someday.

Stops, grins.   Because this is the part he needs to say most...

KIRK
Admit it, Spock. For people like us, the
journey itself... is home.

Young Spock's face.   Lost in feelings that flood through him.
