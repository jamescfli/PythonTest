# scipy: scipy.ndimage submodule dedicated to image processing
from scipy import ndimage

# image is essentially a multiple dimension array
# numpy and scipy are for this kind of operation

# Common tasks in image processing:
#     Input/Output, displaying images
#     Basic manipulations: cropping, flipping, rotating, ...
#     Image filtering: denoising, sharpening
#     Image segmentation: labeling pixels corresponding to different objects
#     Classification
#     Feature extraction
#     Registration
#     ...
